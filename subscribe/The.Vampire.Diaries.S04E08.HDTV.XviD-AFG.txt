00:00:00	Mystic Falls.
		미스틱 폴즈
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	I was born here.
		This is my home.
		내가 태어난 곳
		나의 고향이다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	- And mine.
		- And mine.
		- 내게도
		- 내게도
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	For centuries,
		supernatural creatures
		수세기 간
		초자연적 존재는
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	have lived among us.
		우리 곁에 있었다
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	There are vampires,
		werewolves, doppelgangers...
		뱀파이어
		늑대인간, 도플갱어
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	Witches.
		마녀
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	And even hybrids.
		혼종까지
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	Now I'm one of them,
		a vampire.
		나도 이제 뱀파이어다
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	Since she's turned,
		엘레나가 변한 뒤
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	everything about her
		is different.
		모든 게 달라졌다
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	Something has changed
		between Damon and me.
		데이먼한테 느끼는
		감정이 달라졌어
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	Stefan wants to fix me,
		and Caroline flat out admitted
		스테판은 날 바꾸려
		하고 캐롤라인은
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	that she doesn't
		like me this way.
		내가 이러는게
		싫나 봐요
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	I don't think I've ever
		seen you more alive.
		나한텐 지금
		네가 제일 멋져
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	And now
		we know why.
		이제 이유를 안다
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	Elena is sired
		to Damon.
		엘레나는
		데이먼에게 종속됐어
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:46	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:49	Hey.
		Hey.
		 
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:53	Thought you
		might have left.
		간 줄 알았는데
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	No. I don't have to be
		at school for...
		아뇨, 학교 갈
		필요가 없어서...
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	At least
		20 minutes ago.
		적어도 20분
		전까지는요
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:03	Mm.
		 
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:07	Mm.
		 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	What's that face?
		표정이 왜 그래요?
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:10	What face?
		무슨 표정?
00:01:13	 
		 
00:01:14	That face.
		그 표정이요
00:01:17	 
		 
00:01:17	I'm happy.
		난 행복해
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:28	This is a disaster.
		완전 최악이야
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	Look. We don't know
		anything for sure.
		아직 확실한지
		모르잖아
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	Yes, we do.
		확실해
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:33	Elena is sired
		to Damon,
		엘레나는
		데이먼한테 종속됐어
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	which means her one
		singular burning desire
		데이먼을
		행복하게 하는 게
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	is to make him happy,
		just like Klaus and his hybrids.
		걔의 전부야
		클라우스의 혼종처럼
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	No. It's not.
		그렇지 않아
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	A vampire sired to another
		vampire is one in a million.
		뱀파이어의 종속은
		사막에서 바늘 찾기라고
00:01:44	 
		 
00:01:44	Maybe it won't affect
		her the same way.
		영향을 받지
		않을지도 몰라
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:53	We already know
		it's affecting her.
		벌써 영향을
		받고 있잖아
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	She's become
		Damon's lapdog.
		완전 데이먼의
		펫이 됐다고
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	It's true.
		사실이야
00:01:58	 
		 
00:01:58	Everything he says,
		she agrees with.
		말만 하면
		동의하고
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:00	Everything he
		asks her to do, she does.
		시키는 건
		뭐든 하잖아
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:09	We need
		to do something.
		이래선 안 되겠어
00:02:11	 
		 
00:02:11	Wait. No. Hold on.
		잠깐만
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	Caroline,
		this isn't gossip.
		캐롤라인
		이건 가십이 아냐
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	You can't just
		drop this on her
		뭔지 확실히
		알기 전에는
00:02:15	 
		 
00:02:15	before we know what's
		happening for sure.
		엘레나한테
		말하면 안돼
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	I need to talk
		to Tyler, ok?
		타일러한테
		얘기해야겠어
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:18	Maybe he'll know what to do.
		All right.
		- 방법을 알지도 몰라
		- 알았어
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:19	Talk to Tyler,
		but please don't tell anyone else.
		대신 타일러 말고
		아무에게도 말하지 마
00:02:21	 
		 
00:02:21	If this is true, then
		it may have influence
		그게 사실이면
		엘레나의 모든
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:23	Elena's every action
		and emotion
		행동과 감정에
		영향을 줄 거야
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:25	since she became
		a vampire.
		뱀파이어니까
00:02:27

		This is torture.
		이제 됐어
		이건 고문이야
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:00	Kim, stop.
		He needs to finish.
		킴, 그만해
		아직 안 끝났어
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	Not today, he doesn't.
		오늘은 아냐
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	Yes, today.

		네이트, 딘
		크리스까지 죽고
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	which makes Adrian
		Klaus' right hand.
		에이드리안 밖에
		안 남았어
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	We can't let Adrian
		anywhere near Klaus
		종속이 
		풀릴 때 까지
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	until his sire bond
		is completely broken.

		until he doesn't feel
		고통을 느끼기
		전까지는
00:03:15

		transformation anymore.
		종속이 풀리지 않아
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	If we want
		to get back at Klaus
		클라우스가
		우리한테 한 짓을
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	for everything
		he's done to us,

00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	He doesn't
		have to do anything.
		아무것도
		할 필요 없어
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	Isn't that the point of
		breaking the sire bond...
		그러려고 종속을
		푸는거 아냐?
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	Free will?
		자기 의지를 위해
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:29	Let's go, Adrian.
		가자, 에이드리안
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:35	Ha ha! Bag.
		가방 챙겨
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	I got it. Ahem.
		알아요
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	Scarf.
		What... oh.
		스카프도
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:44	Mm.
		 
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:46	Hmm.
		 
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	Listen, Damon.
		We need to...
		있죠, 데이먼
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	No. No, no, no.
		Don't ruin it.
		아니, 아니
		분위기 깨지 마
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:53	You don't even know
		what I was gonna say.
		무슨 말 하려는지
		모르잖아요
00:03:55	 
		 
00:03:55	Well, I'm assuming it starts with,
		"what are we?"
		아마 '우린 뭐죠?'
		로 시작해서
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	And then ends with
		going to tell Stefan.
		스테판한테 말하는
		걸로 끝나겠지
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	He should know.
		I know he should know.
		- 알려줘야 해요
		- 알지, 알지
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	Just don't know when
		he should know it.
		언제 알려주느냐가
		문제지
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	Well, he knows that something
		is going on between us.
		우리가 썸씽이
		있다는 건 알아요
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:08	I mean, it's the reason
		that he and I broke up.
		그래서 깨진거니까요
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	Yeah, but can't we
		just let ourselves
		그냥 하루만
00:04:11	 
		 
00:04:11	enjoy one secret,
		selfish day
		스테판이
		알기 전에
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	before we destroy his?
		즐기면 안될까?
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:17	Maybe we shouldn't...
		No, Elena.
		- 그럼 안 돼요
		- 아니, 엘레나
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	This is our time.
		이제 우리의 순간이야
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	It's never been right before,
		and it's right now.
		전엔 아니었지만
		이제야 온 거야
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	Just one day?
		딱 하루만
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	One day?
		하루만
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:29	Ok. One day.
		알았어요, 하루만
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:32	Yes.
		Ha ha!
		 
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:43	Hey. Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:47	See you in history?
		학교에서 보자
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	Yeah.
		그래
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:57	Hey.
		 
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:06	Listen.
		저기
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	We need to talk.
		얘기 좀 해
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:14	Sired?
		Really, Stefan?
		종속?
		진심이야, 스테판?
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	That is the most
		pathetic nonsense
		네가 한 말 중에
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	I've ever heard come
		out of your mouth,
		가장 어이없다
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	and you've said some
		crap in your day.
		헛소리 하지마
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	It was your blood
		that turned her, right?
		형의 피로
		엘레나가 변했잖아
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	I mean, she's been different
		since day one because of you.
		형 때문에 
		계속 달랐던 거야
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	You can't deny that.
		인정해
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:27	Sure, I can.
		오, 그래
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	I finally got Elena
		to a good place
		엘레나에게 이제야
		뱀파이어로서
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	about
		being a vampire.
		적응을 시켰는데
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	You two idiots can't
		stand that she's happy
		넌 그냥 엘레나가
		나 때문에 행복한 걸
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:32	because of me.
		부정하는 거야
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	All right. You know what?
		Prove me wrong.
		알았어, 그럼
		증명해 봐
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	Tell her it's ok
		to drink from a blood bag.
		혈액팩을 
		마시라고 해봐
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	She can't.
		못해
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	Her weird
		doppelganger body
		도플갱어라서
		그런지 뭔지
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	rejected the blood
		from the bag.
		혈액팩은 안돼
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	Right, because you
		told her to.
		형이 그렇게
		말했으니까
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	You said she had
		to drink warm human blood
		형이 엘레나한테
		인간 피를 직접
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	straight from the vein.
		마시라고 했잖아
00:05:46	 
		 
00:05:46	She almost died
		to make you happy.
		형 말을 따르다가
		죽을 뻔 했다고
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	Look. Just ask her
		to drink from a blood bag.
		혈액팩을 마시라고
		한 번만 부탁해봐
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	Make sure you tell her how
		happy you'll be if it works,
		그럼 얼마나
		좋을지 얘기해줘
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	and if I'm wrong,
		I'll be the first to apologize.
		내가 틀렸다면
		형한테 사과할게
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	When her body rejects this blood,
		which it will,
		안 봐도 뻔하지만
		만약 안되면
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	your apology
		better be epic.
		그냥 사과로는
		안될 거다
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:10	Elena, hey,
		is everything ok?
		엘레나, 괜찮아?
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	Yeah.
		Why wouldn't it be?
		응, 물론이지
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Well, Caroline told me you had to
		move out to stay away from Jeremy.
		제레미 때문에
		집을 나왔다며
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	Matt is at the house
		staying with him right now
		맷이 대신 있어
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	to make sure he keeps all of
		his hunter stuff in control.
		헌터 문제를
		감시하려고
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	He's ok.
		괜찮을 거야
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	But are you?
		너는?
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	I mean, clearly, they don't have
		a flat iron at hotel Salvatore.
		살바토어 호텔에서
		일 생기면 어쩌려고?
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	Oh. I was in a rush.
		I mean... look.
		어, 좀 급해서
		저기 혹시
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	Do you girls have
		any plans tonight?
		오늘 밤에
		계획 있어?
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	I'm in desperate need
		of some girl talk.
		여자친구들이랑
		얘기하고 싶어
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	I'm in.
		난 없어
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	Shane taught me some small
		spells I've been wanting to try.
		쉐인이 해보고 싶던
		주문을 알려줬거든
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	Oh, creepy Professor guy
		is just Shane now.
		오싹한 교수님에서
		이제 쉐인인거야?
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	He's not creepy.
		오싹하지 않아
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	We're not judging. I am.
		- 평가하는 거 아냐
		- 난 맞아
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	Don't
		listen to her.
		얘 말 듣지 마
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	So girls' night?
		그럼 노는 거지?
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	We can raid
		the Salvatore wine cellar.
		살바토어 와인
		셀러를 터는 거야
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	Are you sure that Stefan
		and Damon are cool
		우리가 그
		집에서 자도
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	with us crashing
		at their place?
		뭐라고 안 할까?
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	I can't go home because
		my brother is trying to kill me.
		날 죽이려는 동생 덕에
		우리 집은 못가니까
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	So their place
		is mine now, too.
		내 집이나
		다름없어
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	I'll see you
		in a bit.
		나중에 보자
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:09	You being here makes
		your selfish, secret day
		여기 있으면
		오늘 계획에
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:12	a little difficult,
		don't you think?
		문제가 있을거라구요
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	Ha ha!
		Forget your lunch.
		점심 가져가야지
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	I can't.
		You know I can't.
		안되요
		알잖아요
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	Well, last time
		you tried it,
		지난 번에는
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	the circumstances
		were less than optimal,
		최적의 상황은
		아니었으니까
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	and I think maybe you should
		just give it another try,
		한 번만 더
		시도해 보고
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	see if it works.
		괜찮은지 보자
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	I really think
		it will.
		괜찮을 거야
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:29	Please... for me?
		제발
		날 위해서
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:51	Mm...
		You ok?
		괜찮아?
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	Um... I'm fine.
		괜찮아요
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	It tastes
		like blood.
		그냥 피
		맛이에요
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	Last time, it was
		like hot garbage.
		저번에는
		정말 이상했는데
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	You sure
		you're ok?
		정말 괜찮아?
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	I'm better than ok.
		정말 괜찮아요
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	I mean, maybe last time,
		it was a bad batch or something.
		저번에 마신 게
		불량이거나 했겠죠
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	I can't believe
		this, Damon.
		정말 좋아요, 데이먼
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	I don't have to hurt
		people anymore.
		이제 사람을
		해치지 않아도 되요
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:24	I have to get
		to class.
		수업 늦겠어요
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	Thank you. Hmm.
		고마워요
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:41	Trespassing, breaking and entering,
		all before noon?
		아침부터
		무단침입이신가?
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	Having trouble
		breaking Adrian.
		에이드리안한테
		문제가 생겼어요
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	Don't worry about it.
		걱정마
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	You already got
		the 12 hybrids I need.
		필요한 12명의
		혼종을 모았으니까
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	We have 11.
		11명이겠죠
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	I told you, Tyler Lockwood
		isn't part of the deal.
		말했죠
		타일러는 빼라고
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Well, now there's
		11 hybrids.
		이제 11명이니까
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	You deliver me 12 without
		loyalties to Klaus,
		종속을 푼 채로
		12명을 넘겨
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	or your friend Tyler
		becomes fair game.
		아니면 타일러야
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	You haven't held up
		your end of the bargain.
		말한 거나 내놔요
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	Right.
		 
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:07	This is everything you
		always wanted to know
		네 생부모에
		관한
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	about your
		biological parents,
		모든게 들어있어
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	and it's encoded in case you're
		thinking of the smash and grab.
		만약에 대비해
		암호화 되어있지
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	Just bring me 12 unsired
		hybrids, and it's yours.
		12명을 데려오면
		그 땐 네거야
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	I talked to Tyler.
		타일러랑 얘기해봤는데
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	And?
		그래서?
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	The sire bound exists
		because the hybrids
		혼종은 보름달마다
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	are grateful to Klaus
		for relieving them
		안 변해도 되는
		것에 감사해서
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:23	from the pain of having
		to wolf out every full moon,
		클라우스한테
		종속되는거래
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	and that's why they
		have to turn
		그래서 고통을
		안 느낄 때까지
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:27	until they're not
		ruled by the pain anymore.
		계속 변해야 하고
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	Right, but Elena
		is not a werewolf.
		근데 엘레나는
		늑대인간이 아니잖아
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	So what's
		the vampire equivalent?
		뱀파이어는
		어떻게 해야되?
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	Well, that's the problem.
		There isn't one.
		그게 문제야
		방법이 없어
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:49	What are you doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Elena is sired.
		엘레나는 종속됐어
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	You were right.
		I was wrong. Happy?
		네 말이 맞았어
		이제 좀 시원해?
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	No. I'm not happy,
		아니
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	but what are we
		gonna do about it?
		그래서 이제
		어떡할 거야?
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	Well, I'm
		working on it.
		방법을 찾고 있어
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	Here. Remember that?
		여기, 기억나?
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	New Orleans.
		뉴올리언스
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:06	1942, to be exact.
		정확히 1942년이지
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	What was in
		new Orleans in 1942?
		그 때 무슨 일이
		있었는데?
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	Other that bourbon
		and beads, us, Stefan.
		술이랑...
		우리, 스테판
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	Oh, yeah.
		아, 기억나
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	What was the name
		of that girl
		형이랑 있던
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	you used
		to hang out with?
		여자 이름이
		뭐였지?
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	That was
		no ordinary girl.
		평범한 여자가
		아니었지
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	That was Charlotte.
		샬롯이었어
00:10:25	That was Charlotte.
		 
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	♪ it don't mean a thing
		 
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	♪ if it ain't got that swing
		 
00:10:27	♪ if it ain't got that swing
		1942년 뉴올리언스
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	♪ doo wah doo wah
		doo wah doo wah... ♪
		 
00:10:30	♪ doo wah doo wah
		doo wah doo wah... ♪
		 
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	She was crazy
		about me from the minute we met.
		처음 본 순간부터
		나한테 미쳐있었지
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	So, of course,
		when she asked me
		그래서 뱀파이어로
		변화시켜 달라고
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	to turn her into a vampire,
		I did.
		부탁했을 때
		들어줬어
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	Hi.
		Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	So did you decide who you would
		like to have for dinner tonight?
		오늘 저녁은
		누구로 할지 정했어?
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	Him.
		저 남자
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	♪ it makes no difference
		if it's sweet or hot ♪
		 
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	He looks tasty.
		맛있어 보여
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	That's a very fine
		choice, miss Charlotte.
		탁월한 선택이십니다
		샬롯양
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	I will go set that up.
		바로 대령하죠
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	Now, if anyone tries
		to touch my drink,
		누구라도 내 
		잔을 건드리면
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	you show them
		no mercy, ok?
		봐주지 마, 알았지?
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	♪ doo wah doo wah
		doo wah doo wah ♪
		 
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	♪ Doo wah doo wah doo wah
		doo wah ♪
		 
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	Drop by after your set.
		Come join us.
		저희랑 같이
		노시죠
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:07	You spilled
		my man's drink.
		잔을 쏟았잖아요
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	Sorry. It's
		crowded in here.
		죄송해요
		안이 북적거려서요
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	That's no excuse.
		말이 안되죠
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	Hey, take it
		easy, lady.
		진정하세요
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	I'm not
		gonna take it easy.
		그렇겐 못하죠
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	Huh! Uh!
		 
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:19	What did you do?
		무슨 짓이야?
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	He touched your drink.
		You said show no mercy.
		네 잔을 쏟았길래
		안 봐준 거야
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	I thought
		you'd be happy.
		좋아할 줄 
		알았는데
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	That was my first clue.
		그게 첫번째
		단서였지
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	She was sired
		to you,
		형한테 종속됐었군
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	and I can only assume you
		took full advantage of that
		그리곤 지겨워
		질 때 까지
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	until you got bored
		of her, right?
		갖고 놀았겠지?
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	More like when she went
		all "fatal attraction" on me.
		나한테 너무
		빠진 게 문제지
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	Then I had to make
		a clean break.
		그래서 깨끗이
		정리했어
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	How'd you do that?
		어떻게?
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	Ah, phew. Here.
		아, 여기
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:44	Who's Valerie la marche?
		발레리가 누구야?
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	The witch that I found
		to help me break
		샬롯의 종속을
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	little Charlotte's
		sire bond.
		풀어준 마녀야
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:51	Ah!
		 
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	Pack your bags,
		baby bro.
		짐 싸, 동생
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	We're going
		to bourbon street.
		뉴올리언스로 간다
00:11:57	 
		 
00:12:03	One for you,
		one for you.
		여기, 너도
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	Ooh.
		 
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	I'm assuming this
		is for Caroline.
		이건 캐롤라인 거군
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	Actually,
		it's for me.
		사실, 내거야
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	Oh, I thought...
		Are you saying that...
		- 내가 알기론...
		- 그 말은...
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	Thanks to Damon, I am now
		a functional dysfunctional vampire.
		데이먼 덕에
		이제 마실 수 있어
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	That's amazing.
		잘됐다
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	What do you mean,
		thanks to Damon?
		데이먼 덕이라니?
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	Well, he suggested
		that I try it again.
		한 번 시도해
		보라고 해서
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	So I did,
		and it worked.
		마셨더니 괜찮았어
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	No more snatch,
		eat, and erase.
		이제 마시고 기억을
		지울 필요가 없지
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	So where is my least
		favorite Salvatore?
		그럼 데이먼은
		어디 갔어?
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	"Out with Stefan
		for the night.
		'스테판과 나왔어'
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	Don't wait up.
		Brother bonding."
		'기다리지 마
		형제끼리 노는거야'
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	Hmm. So you guys
		check-in text now?
		이제 서로 문자로
		확인하는 사이야?
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	What else do you do?
		또 뭘 하는데?
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	I know that you're
		not the biggest fan,
		네가 별로 좋아하지
		않는 건 알지만
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	but he kind of
		just changed my life.
		내 인생을 바꿔줬어
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:48	Do you mind laying off
		on all the hate?
		좀 좋아해 
		주면 안될까?
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Ok. New girls'
		night rule...
		좋아, 새로운
		규칙이야
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	No boy talk, yeah?
		남자 얘기 없기, 응?
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	Plus, why talk
		when we have this?
		그리고 이걸 두고
		왜 얘기를 하겠어?
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Is that
		stoner tea?
		그거 마약이야?
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	It's spirit tea.
		영혼의 차지
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	It opens up your chi
		or whatever.
		기운을 열어준대나
		뭐래나
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	Come on.
		It's not drugs.
		왜 그래
		마약 아냐
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	Shane is helping me
		do natural magic
		영혼들이랑
		접촉하지 않고
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	without having to
		access the spirits.
		마법을 쓰는 걸
		쉐인이 도와주고 있어
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	Mm-hmm.
		Don't judge.
		나쁘게 보지 마
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:16	Ok. Fine.
		알았어
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	I hereby vow
		not to be judgmental
		오늘 저녁
		남은 시간 동안
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	for the rest
		of the evening.
		평가하지 않겠다고
		선언합니다
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	Even if you two are
		potentially ruining your lives
		너희 인생을
		망치든 말든
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	as I stand idly by,
		it's your choice.
		너희 선택이야
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	I'll drink to that.
		그걸로 건배하자
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:32	Cheers.
		건배
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:39	Well, the city is the
		same, just brighter.
		밝아지고
		거의 그대로네
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	Have you been
		back here since '42?
		1942년 이후에
		온 적 있어?
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	Nope, not since
		I shipped off
		아니, 전쟁에
		참가하려고
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	to join the war effort
		and you didn't.
		떠났었지
		형은 아니었고
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	Somebody had to
		entertain the ladies
		누군가는
		남자들이 떠난
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	who had been left
		by their menfolk.
		여자들을
		즐겁게 해 줘야지
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	Hey, good news.
		좋은 소식이야
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	Elena is at the house
		with the girls
		엘레나가 집에서
		친구들이랑
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	where she can't
		get in trouble.
		놀고 있데
		문제없겠군
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	Bad news... think they
		got into the dom.
		나쁜 소식은...
		dom에 들어간 것 같아
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	Told her to make
		herself at home.
		편하게 
		있으라고 했어
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Yeah. You told her,
		so she does, right?
		형이 시키는대로
		하는거야 그렇지?
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	Sire bond is not
		that literal, Stefan.
		종속이 꼭
		그런건 아냐, 스테판
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	Really?
		정말?
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	Name one thing that
		you've asked her to do
		형이 시켜서
		엘레나가 하지
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	that you
		haven't gotten, huh?
		않은 적이 있어?
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	You know what
		I haven't gotten?
		그게 뭔지 알아?
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	Blame, guilt.
		I get it, Stefan.
		비난, 죄책감
		이해해, 스테판
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	I get that you're pissed
		that Elena dumped you
		엘레나가
		내가 좋아서
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	because she has
		feelings for me.
		널 차서 화난거
		이해한다고
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	Bet you blame the sire
		bond for that, too.
		너한텐 그것도
		종속 탓이겠지?
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	Yeah. You know what?
		I absolutely do.
		그래, 종속 탓이야
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	Why, because it's
		impossible to think
		왜? 엘레나가
		내가 좋다는 게
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	she could have
		feelings for me?
		그렇게나
		불가능한 일이야?
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	No, because
		it's impossible
		아니, 형이
		엘레나한테
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	for her to be so blind
		that she doesn't see
		얼마나 나쁜
		존재인 지 깨닫지
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	how wrong you are
		for her.
		못하는 게
		불가능한 거지
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:40	Hey, wait, Damon.
		I'm sorry.
		잠깐, 형
		미안해
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:44	What'd you say?
		뭐라고?
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	"I'm sorry I blame you
		for my bloodlust
		'내 갈증이랑
		리퍼가 된 걸'
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	"and for me
		becoming a ripper.
		'형 탓이라고
		해서 미안해'
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:51	It wasn't your fault."
		'형 탓이 아냐'
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	Do I really have to say
		it wasn't his fault?
		꼭 이렇게
		말해야 해?
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	Yes. Keep going.
		응, 계속해
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	"You're the only
		brother I have,
		'형은 내
		유일한 형제야'
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	and I hope that we can
		be friends again."
		'이제 다시 잘
		지냈으면 좋겠어'
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	Perfect.
		완벽해
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Now, just remember,
		we're here
		잊지 마, 우리는
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:08	to talk to Damon,
		not to yell,
		얘길 하러 왔지
		소리 지르러 온 게 아냐
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	not to dredge up the past,
		and most definitely
		과거 들먹이지 말고
		무엇보다도
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	not to pick a fight.
		싸우러 온 게 아냐
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	That's the real
		trick, isn't it?
		그게 관건이군
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	You've spent the last 20 years
		turning your life around.
		지난 20년 동안
		네 삶을 바꿨잖아
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	It's time to make nice
		with your brother.
		형이랑 화해할
		때도 됐지
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:39	You look like a guy
		I used to know.
		우리 아는
		사이었죠?
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	Hello, Damon.
		안녕, 형
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	Come to put
		a stake in my heart?
		심장에 말뚝이라도
		박으러 왔나?
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	More like bury
		the hatchet.
		화해하러 왔어
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:56	Ha!
		 
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:59	Ahh... Egypt. Ha!
		이집트, 좋지!
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	Finally gonna get
		to see the pyramids.
		드디어 피라미드를
		보겠구나
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	Oh, I doubt I'll be
		doing much sightseeing
		전선에서
		구급차를 몰면서
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	driving an ambulance
		through the front lines,
		관광을 할 지
		의문이지만 말야
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	but... yeah, yeah... Egypt.
		어쨌든, 이집트야
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	Think they have room
		for another driver?
		기사 한명
		더 끼어도 되지?
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	I could handle
		some war
		전쟁쯤이야 뭐
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	if it meant spending quality
		time with my little brother.
		동생과 함께할 수
		있다면야
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	Tell you what.
		I'll talk to my C.O.
		지휘관한테 말해볼게
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:29	You're not going.
		넌 가면 안돼
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	I don't like you.
		난 네가 싫어
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	In 1912, you pressured
		Stefan to drink human blood.
		1912년 넌 스테판에게
		인간피를 마시라고 했지
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	He's been trying to put
		his ripper days behind him,
		리퍼로서의 시절을
		지우려고 하는데
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	but he needs to see
		death and blood
		죽음과 피를
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	and deal with them
		as a part of life.
		인생의 일부로
		받아들이게 됐잖아
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	He needs balance,
		restraint.
		균형이 필요해
		자제력이
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	What makes you think I'm
		not balanced and restrained?
		왜 내가 자제력이
		없다고 생각해?
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	The fact that you
		never have been.
		넌 절대 
		그런 적이 없었지
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	You think of what you want first,
		second, and third.
		네가 원하는 게
		항상 우선이잖아
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	Stefan is better off alone
		than in your company.
		스테판은 네가
		없는 게 더 나아
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	Well, I beg to differ.
		과연 그럴까
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	To the Salvatores
		in Egypt.
		이집트의 살바토어
		형제를 위해
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	Cheers.
		Cheers.
		건배
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Cheers.
		건배
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:05	Damon...
		데이먼
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:08	Did you forget you were
		supposed to meet us for dinner?
		저녁 때 여기서
		보기로 한 거 잊었어?
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	Sorry. I lost
		track of time.
		미안, 시간
		가는 줄 모르고
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	I brought you leftovers.
		남은 음식 가져왔어
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	Charlotte!
		샬롯!
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:18	Get away from him.
		스테판한테 떨어져
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	Stefan... Stefan.
		스테판, 스테판
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	I... I... Stefan...
		스테판
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	She's better off
		without you, too.
		이 여자도 네가
		없는 게 나아
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:32	I apologize,
		all right?
		사과할게, 응?
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	As much as I hate
		this sire bond thing,
		종속이 싫다고
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	I shouldn't take it
		out on you.
		형한테 화내면
		안됐었어
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	It's not really
		your fault.
		형 잘못이 아냐
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	Well, don't get all
		warm and fuzzy on me yet.
		이제 됐어
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	It's where
		the witch lived.
		여기에 마녀가
		살았었어
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	What, you weren't expecting to find
		the same exact witch in the same place.
		그대로 있을거라
		생각한 건 아니지?
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	No, but since I couldn't
		remember where the store was,
		아냐, 근데 정확히
		기억이 안나서
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	figured I'd
		get us a start.
		여기서 
		시작하려고 했지
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	Maybe there's
		another place to start.
		다른 데서 시작하자
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	You think Charlotte might
		be in new Orleans?
		샬롯이 아직
		뉴올리언스에 있을까?
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	Yeah, maybe.
		응, 아마
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	Where's the last place
		you saw her?
		마지막으로 
		본 게 어디야?
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Corner of bourbon
		and dumaine.
		Bourbon and Dumaine
		코너에서
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	Kind of told her to
		count every brick
		뉴올리언스 건물에
		있는 모든 벽돌을
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	in every building
		in new Orleans,
		세라고 시켰었거든
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	and I'd meet her
		at the corner.
		그리곤 코너에서
		만나기로 했지
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	I was gone
		by the morning.
		난 아침에
		떠났었고
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:11	Where you going?
		어디가?
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	Corner of bourbon
		and dumaine,
		Bourbon and Dumaine
		코너에
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	see how literal
		the sire bond is.
		종속이 어떤지
		한 번 보자고
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:20	They're gonna get us
		both killed,
		우릴 죽이려
		할 텐데
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	and we're just
		sitting here.
		우린 그냥
		앉아있네
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:23	Kim is right.
		킴 말이 맞아
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	The point of breaking
		the sire bond is being free.
		자유로워 지려고
		종속을 푸는건데
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	They don't have
		to listen to me.
		내 말을 들을
		필요는 없어
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	Yes, they do, Ty.
		You can make them.
		필요해, 타일러
		그렇게 시켜
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	Hybrids are
		werewolves first.
		혼종은 어쨌든
		늑대인간이야
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	Wolves run in packs,
		and every pack
		늑대는 무리로
		행동하고 무리는
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	needs an Alpha,
		or they end up
		알파가 필요하지
		그렇지 않으면
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	challenging each other
		for dominance.
		서로 알파가
		되려고 하지
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	Kim is challenging
		your position as Alpha.
		킴은 알파가 되려고
		너한테 도전하는 거야
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	You need to put her
		in her place... now.
		그렇게는 못두지, 어서
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:53	Long day tomorrow,
		Adrian.
		힘 좀 들겠어
		에이드리안
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	You want it to go
		better than today,
		오늘 보다
		잘 하려면
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	you need
		to get some rest.
		좀 쉬어야지
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	Who do you
		think you are?
		네가 뭔데?
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	The guy telling you
		to call it a night.
		끝내라고
		하는 중이잖아
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:09	This could get a lot uglier right
		now, but I'm not gonna let it.
		다시는 덤벼들지 마
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	Challenge me again, this
		conversation will end differently.
		다시 그러면
		어떻게 될지 보자고
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	You understand? Right.
		Whatever you say.
		- 알아들어?
		- 알았어
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	Finish your drink and get
		Adrian back to the stables.
		어서 끝내고
		마구간으로 돌아가
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	We'll meet you there.
		거기서 보지
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:29	Where we going?
		어디가?
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	To pick a fight.
		싸우러
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:36	No way is she gonna be in
		the same spot after 70 years.
		70년이나 됐는데
		여기 있을리가 없다고
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	So what are we
		gonna tell Elena?
		엘레나한테는
		뭐라고 해?
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	I was hoping we wouldn't
		have to tell her anything.
		아무 말 않는 거지
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	Well, we can't
		just lie to her.
		거짓말 할 순 없어
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	It's not a lie.
		거짓말이 아냐
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	It's an omission for
		the greater good.
		선을 위한
		생략이지
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	Oh, I see. I see.
		오, 알겠다
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	That's Damon speak for,
		"let's not do the right thing.
		형 말대로 하면
		'옳은 일 말고'
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	Let's just do
		what's right for me."
		'내게 옳은
		일을 하자'는 거지
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	Oh, what about you,
		o selfless one?
		너는 어떻고
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	Are you doing what's best for
		Elena or what's best for you?
		너야말로 너를
		위한 거 아냐?
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	Because it looks to me
		like the only reason
		나한테는 네가
		엘레나 종속을
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	you want to break
		Elena's sire bond
		풀려는게 다시
		엘레나랑
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	is to restore her original
		factory team Stefan settings.
		잘해보려고
		그러는 거 같거든
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:09	I'm gonna go get
		a drink.
		한잔하러 가야겠다
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:11	Hunt me down when you
		stop being a dick.
		뉘우치고 와
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:39	What the hell
		just happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:41	She kissed me.
		나한테 키스했어
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:47	Damon, I always knew
		you'd come back for me.
		데이먼, 나한테
		돌아올 줄 알았어
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:53	I must have counted
		literally every brick
		뉴올리언스에 있는
		모든 건물의
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	on every building
		in all of new Orleans.
		벽돌을 세고
		있었거든
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:59	Literally every brick?
		말 그대로
		모든 벽돌이지?
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:09	Uh, Charlotte...
		Heh heh...
		어, 샬롯
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	Please tell me
		you had a full life
		벽돌 세는 거 말고
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	and that you've done something
		other than counting bricks.
		다른 일도
		하면서 지낸거지?
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:19	Of course I have.
		I'm not crazy.
		당연하지
		미친 것도 아니고
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	Then why are you still here?
		그럼 왜 아직
		여기 있는 거야?
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	You know, when someone
		breaks up with you
		누구라도
		관계가 깨지면
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	and there's a song
		that reminds you of them,
		과거를 상기시키는
		노래가 있기 마련이지
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	first, you hate it,
		처음엔 정말 싫지만
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	but then it brings back
		all the good memories of them.
		나중에는 모든
		추억이 되살아나
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	Counting the bricks
		is my song,
		벽돌 세는 게
		나한테는 노래였어
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	and I've been playing it
		for decades.
		몇십년 간
		계속 해왔고
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	That's a really
		long time
		정말 긴 시간이네
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	stuck listening
		to the same song.
		계속 같은
		노래만 듣기에는
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	Yeah. Heh.
		응, 그래
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	Well, you know,
		in the plus column,
		그러니까 넌
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:48	you know new Orleans better
		than anyone in the world,
		뉴올리언스에 대해
		누구보다 잘 알겠네
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	which is really nice
		정말 잘됐다
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	because we need your help
		finding someone.
		누굴 찾는데
		네 도움이 필요해
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:58	 
		 
00:22:26	All right!
		 
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:29	Aah!
		Aah!
		 
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:38	Check this out...
		Vamp speed video.
		봐, 뱀파이어
		스피드 비디오야
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	Mm.
		 
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:44	I look like
		superman.
		나 꼭
		슈퍼맨 같다
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:47	Watch this.
		이것 봐
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	This year's
		Christmas card.
		올해 크리스마스
		카드 감이야
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	Being a vampire
		is so weird.
		뱀파이어가 된다는 게
		참 이상하지
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	Oh, my God,
		I love this bathtub.
		세상에, 이 욕조
		너무 맘에 든다
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	Why don't we come
		and hang out here more often?
		왜 지금까지
		이렇게 안 놀았지?
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	I'll tell you why.
		Cooties.
		내가 알아
		세균이야
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	Think of all
		the germ-ridden skanks
		데이먼이
		하는 짓을 보라고
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	that Damon has lured
		into his den of iniquity.
		아주 세균이
		득실거리잖아
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:11	Ok. I'm sorry.
		I've been good all night.
		알았어, 미안해
		진짜 재밌었어
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	I am stopping now.
		이제 안 할게
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	No. Don't stop
		on my account.
		아니, 멈추지 마
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	Rip away.
		계속 해봐
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	I mean, it's only
		Damon, right?
		데이먼 때문이잖아
		그렇지?
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	Well, say what you want
		about ripper Stefan,
		리퍼였던
		스테판을 생각하면
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	but at least he
		wasn't a man slut.
		적어도 걸레는
		아니었지
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:24	Come on.
		왜 그래
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	So what exactly
		was it about him
		그럼 대체 왜
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:27	that made you jump
		right into bed with him
		데이먼을 
		만나자 마자
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	as soon as you met him?
		침대로 뛰어든 거야?
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	I didn't know what
		a sociopathic narcissist he was.
		데이먼이 어떤
		사람인지 몰랐으니까
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	He's always been there for me
		when I needed him.
		내가 힘들 때
		항상 옆에 있었어
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:36	Yeah, because he's hoping
		you'll sleep with him.
		너랑 자고 
		싶으니까 그랬겠지
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:39	Well, maybe I did.
		벌써 잤다면
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:41	You did what?
		You didn't.
		- 뭘 했다고?
		- 설마
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	Yeah. I did.
		그래, 잤어
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:46	Look. I know you two
		have issues with him,
		너희 둘이 데이먼을
		싫어하는 건 알지만
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	but I'm happy,
		and I wanted to spend tonight
		난 행복해
		데이먼 얘기를 하면서
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	with my best friends so that
		I could tell them about it.
		너희들이랑 같이
		놀려고 했다고
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:59	 
		 
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:06	Can I help you,
		gentlemen?
		무슨 일이시죠?
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:08	Hi.
		Looking for a witch.
		마녀를 찾고
		있는데요
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:10	Sorry. No time
		for pleasantries.
		인사는 건너뛰죠
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:12	I'm sorry.
		I don't understand.
		죄송하지만
		이해가 안 되네요
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	Look...
		Nandi, is it?
		난디, 맞죠?
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:17	Let's skip the part
		where you pretend
		모르는 척 하기는
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:18	like you don't know what
		we're talking about.
		빨리 넘어가죠
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:21	We need a spell that could
		break a vampire sire bond.
		뱀파이어 종속을
		풀 주문이 필요해요
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:23	Now, there was a witch here
		named val.
		밸이라는 마녀가
		있었는데
00:24:25	 
		 
00:24:25	Ring any bells?
		기억나요?
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	She was my
		great-grandmother.
		증조할머니셨죠
00:24:28	 
		 
00:24:28	She had a grimoire,
		and it had a spell.
		주술책이 있었고
		거기 주문이 있어요
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	The magic
		you're talking about
		네가 원하는
		주문은
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:35	is dark, powerful.
		어둡고, 강력해
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	Magic like this
		doesn't come cheap.
		이런 주문은
		싸게 안되지
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:43	How much?
		그럼 얼마나?
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	Money won't cut it
		here, pretty one.
		돈으로는 안돼
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	Dark magic draws power
		from dark places.
		어둠의 마법은 어두운
		곳에서 힘을 끌어내지
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	Casting the spell
		you need
		이 주문을 하려면
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	requires the sacrifice
		of 12 human souls.
		열두 사람의
		영혼이 필요해
00:24:56	 
		 
00:24:56	A sacrifice?
		제물이라고?
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	You brought me here
		knowing that the spell
		제물이 필요한 걸
		알면서 날
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	required
		a human sacrifice.
		여기 데려왔어?
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:00	Well, I was hoping
		the recipe had changed.
		방법이
		바뀌었나 싶었지
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	Look. There's no magic
		like that here.
		그런 주문은
		여기 없어요
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	I sell herbs
		and homeopathic remedies
		난 약초랑
		약제를 팔면서
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	and dress it up
		with a little witchy-woo
		관광객들 때문에
		마녀처럼 입고
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:07	for the tourists,
		but I don't practice.
		있는거지
		주문은 못해요
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	Ok. Fine. Listen.
		알았어요
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	Just tell us where
		we can find someone
		그럼 밸처럼
		종속을
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	like your great-grandma
		who can break the sire bond
		풀 수 있는
		마녀를
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	and won't flake out on us
		like old val did.
		어디서 찾을지
		말해줘요
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	There's no one.
		없어요
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	All of her stuff is gone...
		The grimoires, her journals.
		그분의 모든 게 없어요
		주술책, 일기장...
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	We lost it all
		during Katrina.
		허리케인 때문에
		모두 잃어버렸어요
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	If a spell like that
		ever existed,
		그런 주문이
		있었다 해도
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	it's gone for good.
		이제는 없어요
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:35	Elena, come here.
		엘레나, 제발
00:25:37	 
		 
00:25:37	Party is over.
		You guys need to leave.
		파티는 끝났어
		이제 가줘
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	Don't be mad, ok?
		We're just looking out for you.
		화내지 마
		널 위한 거야
00:25:42	 
		 
00:25:42	Do you think it
		makes me happy
		너희가 데이먼을
		싫어하는 게
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:44	that you guys
		hate him?
		날 위한 거야?
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	I get it.
		나도 알아
00:25:47	 
		 
00:25:47	His track record has
		been kind of spotty,
		데이먼 행동이
		좋지는 않았지
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	but I don't
		hate him.
		하지만 난
		데이먼이 좋아
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	I can't. He's...
		좋다고
00:25:52	 
		 
00:25:54	I think I'm falling
		in love with him.
		데이먼을
		사랑하는 것 같아
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	Ugh, you're not falling
		in love with him, Elena.
		넌 데이먼을
		사랑하는 게 아냐
00:25:58	 
		 
00:25:58	You're sired
		to him.
		넌 종속된 거야
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:00	What?
		뭐?
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	What are you
		talking about?
		그게 무슨 소리야?
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	I...
		 
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	Look. I'm sorry
		that it came out like that,
		이렇게 말하게
		되서 미안해
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	but it's true.
		하지만 사실이야
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	Damon's blood turned you.
		데이먼의 피가
		널 변화시켰어
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	You couldn't feed
		from animals or blood bags
		넌 동물피나 혈액팩을
		마실 수 없었지
00:26:17	 
		 
00:26:17	because he told you so.
		데이먼이 
		그렇게 말했으니까
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	Then he suggested that you
		try again with blood bags,
		그리곤 혈액팩을
		다시 마셔보라 했고
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	and suddenly...
		No.
		- 그리고는 갑자기...
		- 아냐
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	There's no way. I...
		Are you sure?
		- 말도 안돼
		- 확실해?
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:27	Yeah.
		Ask Stefan about it.
		응, 스테판한테
		물어봐
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	He can explain it
		better than I can.
		나보다 더
		잘 알아
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	I'm sorry. You talked
		to Stefan about this?
		이 얘기를
		스테판한테 했다고?
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:32	It's not your fault,
		Elena, ok?
		네 잘못이
		아냐, 엘레나
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	Damon took advantage
		of you.
		데이먼은 널
		이용한 거야
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	Ok. You need to leave... Now.
		알았어, 제발 가줘
		당장
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	Elena... Come on.
		엘레나, 제발
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	I said leave.
		가라고 했지
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	Hello, girls.
		안녕, 얘들아
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:52	Ugh!
		 
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:59	 
		 
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:04	Stop.
		그만 해
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	One bite from a hybrid,
		and she's dead, remember?
		혼종한테 물리면
		죽어, 알지?
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:12	Caroline.
		캐롤라인?
00:27:17	 
		 
00:27:24	Witch is lying.
		그 마녀 말은
		거짓말이야
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:25	Doesn't practice
		magic, my ass.
		마법을 못 쓴다니
		말도 안되지
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:27	Human sacrifice?
		인간 제물?
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	Did you really think
		that I would go for this?
		정말 내가 그걸
		원한다 생각해?
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	Extreme circumstances
		call for extreme measures.
		극단적인 상황엔
		불가피한 법이지
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:34	Did you kill those
		12 people in 1942?
		1942년에
		12명을 죽였어?
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	Absolutely, I did,
		and I'd do it again
		당연하지
		그리고 엘레나와
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	in a heartbeat if it meant
		a clean slate with Elena.
		깨끗이 시작할 수 있다면
		기꺼이 다시 할 거야
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	Hmm.
		 
00:27:42	 
		 
00:27:42	Are you gonna help me good
		cop/bad cop this witch, or not?
		도와줄 거야, 말 거야?
00:27:45	 
		 
00:27:47	I get it, hayley.
		알겠어, 헤일리
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:48	I'll find them, and
		I'll get them in line.
		찾아서 돌아갈게
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	Bonnie says no luck
		with the locator spell.
		보니가 추적
		주문은 못 한대
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	They've got to be here.
		여기 있을 거야
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	They're not dumb enough
		to risk getting caught
		마을에서 클라우스한테
		붙잡히는 짓은
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	by Klaus in town.
		하지 않을 거야
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Well, what do they want
		with Caroline?
		캐롤라인한테
		뭘 원하는 거야?
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:58	Kim is trying to prove
		she's the Alpha.
		킴은 알파가
		되려고 해
00:27:59	 
		 
00:27:59	If I can make her submit,
		the pack will fall in line,
		킴을 굴복시키면
		무리도 따를 거고
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	and we can finally get them
		free of Klaus.
		클라우스의 굴레에서
		벗어날 수 있어
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	You'd think they'd play along
		with how much they hate him.
		얼마나 싫어한다고
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:05	But Adrian doesn't,
		does he?
		에이드리안은
		아니잖아, 그렇지?
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	I mean, he's still
		sired to Klaus.
		아직 종속되어있잖아
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	Being sired doesn't mean you
		feel differently about someone.
		종속 된다고 해서
		감정이 바뀌진 않아
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	I hated Klaus,
		but I still did everything he said.
		난 클라우스가 싫었지만
		시키는 대로 했어
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:16	The bond affects
		how you act,
		종속은 행동을
		조종하는 거지
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:18	not how you feel.
		감정이 아냐
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:20	Aah!
		 
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:31	What are you
		doing here?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	Calling you out.
		당신을 찾아왔죠
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	You're not Val's
		great-granddaughter.
		당신은 밸의
		손녀딸이 아냐
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	You're her daughter.
		밸의 딸이지
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:42	You're 80 years old.
		You don't look a day over 50.
		여든이 넘었을 텐데
		쉰도 안 돼 보이는군
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	You're a
		practicing witch.
		당신은 마녀야
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	Get out of my store.
		여기서 나가
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	Give me what I want.
		원하는 걸 내놔
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	Ugh! Yaagh! Gaah!
		 
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:54	I gave you a chance
		to leave with your life.
		떠날 기회를 줬잖아
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	Wait, wait,
		wait, wait.
		잠깐, 잠깐
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	We don't want
		any trouble, ok?
		이런 건
		원치 않아
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:01	We just need your help.
		That's all.
		당신 도움이 필요해
		그게 다야
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	I told you,
		말했지
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	there's no one here
		who can help you.
		여기 당신들을
		도울 사람은 없다고
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:08	Agh!
		 
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:09	The kind of magic my mother
		practiced, it's unnatural.
		엄마가 했던 마법은
		자연스러운 게 아냐
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	Witches don't even
		call it magic.
		마녀들은 그걸
		마법이라 하지도 않아
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	We call it expression.
		우린 그걸
		'표출'이라 부르지
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:19	Is that like
		black magic?
		어둠의 마법
		같은 건가?
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:21	Worse.
		더 심하지
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	Channeling the power
		of human sacrifices
		인간의 제물로
		힘을 끌어내는 건
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:24	calls on darkness
		that can't exist
		상상도 못할
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	on this plane without
		swallowing it whole.
		어둠을 불러내지
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	She sold you a bill of goods
		about breaking the sire bond
		그 힘을 얻으려고
		엄마는 너한테
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	because she wanted
		access to that power,
		거짓말을 한 거야
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	and you gave it to her when
		you killed those 12 people.
		넌 사람을 죽이고
		그 힘을 건네줬지
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:38	Are you saying
		there's no spell?
		주문이 없다는 소리야?
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:40	The bond can't be
		broken with magic.
		종속은 주문으로
		푸는 게 아냐
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:43	A vampire only bonds
		to her sire
		뱀파이어는 오직
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:46	when she has
		feelings for him
		인간이었을 때
		감정이 있어야
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	before she turns,
		human feelings.
		종속이 되지
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:51	Vampirism only
		heightens those emotions.
		뱀파이어가 되면
		감정이 증폭되는 거고
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:59	You want her free?
		You have to set her free.
		종속을 풀고 싶어?
		그녀를 놓아줘
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	Tell her to live
		her life without you
		너 없이
		살라고 전해
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:05	and never think
		of you again,
		다시는 
		생각하지 말고
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:07	to stop caring
		about you,
		신경쓰지
		않도록 해
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	and then leave her.
		그리고 그녀
		곁을 떠나
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:11	That's the only way
		around the sire bond.
		그게 유일한
		방법이야
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:17	Aah! Yaah!
		 
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	Why are you
		doing this?
		왜 이러는 거야?
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	To show Tyler
		who's in charge.
		타일러한테 누가
		알파인지 보여주려고
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	Aah!
		 
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	Stop it.
		Stop it, Kim.
		그만해, 킴
00:30:28	 
		 
00:30:28	Caroline is
		with us, all right?
		캐롤라인은
		우리 편이야
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:30	We're all
		on the same team.
		우린 다
		같은 편이라고
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:31	She's on
		your team, not mine.
		네 팀이겠지
		내가 아니라
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:47	Aah!
		Stop it! Stop!
		그만 해! 그만!
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	Ease up, Kim.
		Klaus won't like this.
		살살해, 킴
		클라우스가 싫어할 거야
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:52	Huh, that's
		a very good point.
		잘 됐네
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	Do you think
		he'll like this?
		이건 좋아할까?
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:57	Kim, don't do it.
		I swear to God...
		킴, 안돼
		부탁이야
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:00	No. Wait, wait,
		wait, wait, wait.
		잠깐, 잠깐
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	If you really want to
		hit Klaus where it hurts,
		클라우스한테
		보복하고 싶으면
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:02	then torture me
		instead.
		나를 괴롭혀
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	He's fixated
		on keeping me alive.
		날 살려두려고
		하니까
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:07	You want real
		revenge, or not?
		진짜 보복을 원해?
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:14	Uh!
		 
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:17	Ugh! Stay back!
		물러서!
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:20	I'll rip her heart out
		right now.
		심장을 뽑아버릴 거야
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:23	Kim put you all
		at risk today,
		킴은 너희 모두를
		위험에 빠트렸어
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:26	and I'm not
		gonna hurt her.
		난 킴을
		해치지 않아
00:31:27	 
		 
00:31:27	I'm not Klaus.
		난 클라우스가
		아니니까
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	I don't kill and torture
		my own friends to get what I want.
		난 나 좋자고
		동료를 죽이지 않아
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	Now, we broke
		the sire bond,
		우리는 이제
		종속이 풀렸어
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	but if you want
		to be free,
		하지만 정말
		자유롭고 싶다면
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	we have to work
		together.
		우린 뭉쳐야 해
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	No one can step
		out of line.
		누구도 어겨서는
		안된다고
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	Now, you're either
		with me
		내 말을 따르던지
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:44	or you're against me.
		나한테 저항해봐
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	Submit.
		복종해
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	Submit, or you die.
		복종해
		아니면 죽는다
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:53	I'm...
		I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:57	 
		 
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:29	So you're just
		leaving me again?
		다시 날
		떠나는 거야?
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	No. I need to get on
		with my life,
		아니, 나도 내
		삶을 살아야지
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	and so do you.
		너도 그렇고
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	I don't want to live
		without you.
		당신 없이
		살기는 싫어
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	If you want to make me happy,
		you will.
		내가 행복하길
		바란다면, 그렇게 해
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	You just forget
		about me.
		그냥 날 잊어
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:44	You'll never
		think of me again,
		생각하지도 말고
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	and you'll find someone new,
		and you'll be happier than ever.
		새로운 사람을 찾아
		행복해지는 거야
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	Please just
		stop crying.
		그만 좀 울어
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:58	I'm never gonna be able
		to forget about you.
		당신을 잊을
		수는 없어
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	Yes. You are,
		아니, 가능해
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	and I'm never gonna
		be happy until you realize
		그리고 네가
		나 없이도
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	that you're never gonna
		have the life that you deserve
		행복할 수 있다는 걸
		깨닫기 전까지
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	if I'm in it.
		나도 행복할 수 없어
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:16	Good-bye, Charlotte.
		잘 있어, 샬롯
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:35	How'd it go?
		Set her free.
		- 어떻게 됐어?
		- 보내줬어
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:38	Must've been hard,
		doing the right thing,
		옳은 일을 한 거야
		힘들었겠어
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	especially when it's not
		something you want to do.
		특히나 형이 원하지
		않는 일이었으니까
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	Get to the point,
		Stefan.
		요점만 말해, 스테판
00:33:46	 
		 
00:33:46	You don't think I'm gonna
		be able to do what I need to
		내가 엘레나한테
		나한테서 떨어지라고
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	when I have to tell Elena
		to stay away from me.
		말할거라고
		생각하는 건 아니겠지
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	Well, I mean,
		selflessness isn't exactly
		이타심이 형의
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:51	one of your most obvious
		character traits, Damon.
		성격은 아니니까
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	Yeah? Well, one of these days,
		you're gonna realize
		그래? 곧 네가
		나를 반도 알지
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:56	you don't know me
		half as well as you think.
		못한다는 걸
		깨닫게 될 거다
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:58	 
		 
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:17	Hi. All right.
		 
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:22	Damon... I
		know what you did,
		데이먼, 난 네가
		한 짓을 알아
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:27	and you're not going
		overseas with Stefan.
		넌 스테판과 이집트에
		가서는 안돼
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	Do you understand me?
		내 말 알아들어?
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	Well, Uncle Sam
		begs to differ.
		샘 삼촌 생각은
		다르더라고
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	You just killed
		12 innocent people.
		넌 무고한
		12명을 죽였어
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	How do you know they
		didn't have it coming?
		어떻게 안 거야?
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:43	Your brother has spent
		the last 20 years
		네 동생은
		지난 20년을
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	racked with guilt,
		fighting the temptation
		죄책감에 사로잡혀
		인간 피를 마시려는
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	to drink human blood.
		욕망을 억누르고 살았어
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	He's serving in war
		as penance
		자기가 한 일에
		대해 속죄하려고
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:52	for the pain
		that he's caused.
		전쟁에 
		참가하는 거야
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:54	If he finds out
		what you did,
		네가 무슨 짓을
		했는지 알게 되면
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:56	he'll want to know
		how it is you function
		네가 어떻게
		죄책감을
00:34:59	 
		 
00:34:59	without guilt for
		the things that you do.
		느끼지 않는지
		알려고 할 거고
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	He'll turn to you for
		guidance like he did before,
		예전처럼 너한테
		조언을 구하겠지
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	and he'll become
		the ripper of Monterrey
		그리곤 다시
		리퍼가 되겠지
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:08	all over again.
		또 다시 말야
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	I've pretty much
		been on my own
		1912년
		다툼 이후로
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	since our little
		falling out in 1912.
		난 항상 혼자였어
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	Did you ever think
		that I just need my little brother?
		나도 내 동생이
		필요하다고
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	And that's why
		you can't go.
		그래서 넌
		갈 수 없는 거야
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	It might be good
		for you, Damon,
		너에겐 좋을지
		모르지만, 데이먼
00:35:25	 
		 
00:35:25	but it will
		destroy Stefan.
		스테판을
		망가뜨릴 거야
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:28	For once, you need
		to put someone else
		이번 한번만
		다른 사람을
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	in front of yourself.
		먼저 생각해 줘
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:37	You need
		to let him go.
		스테판을 보내줘
00:35:40	 
		 
00:36:00	Good luck, brother.
		행운을 빈다, 동생아
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:14	I didn't know
		about that.
		난 전혀 몰랐어
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	Yeah. Well, next time,
		I'll hang a billboard.
		그래, 다음에는
		광고라도 낼게
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	I know it may seem like
		I'm being unfair about this,
		내가 엘레나를
		형한테 뺏겨서
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:21	like I'm upset about
		losing Elena to you,
		이러는 것처럼
		보일 수도 있지만
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	and I am, but after
		all this is over,
		실제로 그렇고 다만
		이번 일이 끝나고
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	if she never feels
		the same way about me
		엘레나가 형을
		그대로 좋아한다면
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	as she used to,
		at least it'll be her choice.
		그건 온전히
		엘레나의 선택이야
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	The dreaded c-word.
		무섭기도 해라
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:37	I know what I have
		to do, Stefan.
		난 내가 뭘 해야
		하는지 알아, 스테판
00:36:40	 
		 
00:37:01	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:05	Hey, if you don't start
		hugging me back,
		날 다시
		안아주지 않으면
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:08	this is gonna get really
		awkward really fast.
		내가 너무
		뻘쭘해지잖아
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	You've got
		my hands pinned down.
		너 때문에
		손을 못 올리겠어
00:37:12	 
		 
00:37:12	Oh.
		 
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:15	Heh.
		 
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:18	I'm a jerk.
		난 정말 못됐어
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:20	I promise to never
		again judge ever.
		다시는 나쁘게
		보지 않을게
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:22	Just please don't tell
		Stefan about me and Damon.
		스테판한테는 우리
		사이를 말하면 안돼
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	I promise
		that I'll tell him.
		내가 꼭 말할게
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:28	I just need to figure out
		some stuff first.
		일단 먼저 좀
		알아낼 게 있어
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	Of course.
		물론이지
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:35	You guys
		friends again?
		화해한거지?
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	Thank God.
		다행이다
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:38	Well, she
		saved my life,
		내 목숨을
		구해줬잖아
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	in spite of me being the nasty,
		bad witch.
		내가 이렇게
		못되게 굴었는데도
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:42	Thankfully, we had
		our good witch.
		다행이도, 우린
		멋진 마녀가 있었지
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	You know, your
		hottie creepy Professor
		네 그 오싹한
		교수님이 정말
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	really knows
		his stuff, Bonnie.
		무언갈 알고
		있나봐, 보니
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	It's been baby steps,
		but he's helping
		아직 처음이지만
		완전 새로운 마법을
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	with a whole new kind
		of magic.
		가르쳐주고 계셔
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	He calls it expression.
		우린 그걸
		'표출'이라고 부르지
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:58	You ever hear
		of a text message,
		문자 받으면
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	maybe just give a guy
		a heads-up?
		미리 좀
		알려주지 그래?
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	Adrian finished
		breaking the sire bond.
		에이드리안이
		종속을 풀었어요
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	You have
		your 12 hybrids.
		이제 12명의
		혼종이 모였죠
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	Now, where
		are my parents?
		우리 부모님은
		어디 계시죠?
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	They're dead.
		돌아가셨어
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:12	You lied to me?
		No.
		- 거짓말 한 거에요?
		- 아니
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	I didn't lie to you.
		거짓말이 아니지
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	I said I'd tell you
		where to find them.
		난 너희 부모님이
		어딨는지 알려준댔지
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	This is everything
		you ever wanted to know,
		여기 네가
		원하던 거다
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:20	including
		where they're buried.
		무덤이 있는
		장소까지 있어
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:21	You just picked a fight
		with a werewolf.
		당신 늑대인간한테
		시비를 건 거야
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	You know that,
		right?
		알고 있지?
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:24	Easy, killer,
		all right?
		제발 진정해
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	I'm not declaring
		war here.
		싸우려는 게 아냐
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	Just because
		they're dead
		너희 부모님이
		돌아가셨다 해서
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	doesn't mean you can't
		see them again.
		볼 수 없는 건 아냐
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	What?
		뭐라고요?
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	Oh, this is far
		from over, hayley.
		끝나지 않았어, 헤일리
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	We are the beginning.
		이제 시작이야
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:43	You feel
		sorry for him?
		데이먼한테
		미안하다고?
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:45	Look. There's no other way to
		break a vampire's sire bond.
		뱀파이어 종속을
		풀 방법은 없어
00:38:48	 
		 
00:38:48	As much as you and I
		both hate it,
		우리가 종속을
		싫어하는 만큼
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	Damon does
		love Elena.
		데이먼은
		엘레나를 사랑해
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:53	Now he has to
		completely let her go.
		이제 엘레나를
		보내줘야 한다니
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:55	Can you imagine
		having to do that?
		상상이 가니?
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	I'm sorry
		I told her, ok?
		미안해, 말해버렸어
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	I kind of
		didn't have a choice.
		어쩔 수 없었어
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:01	All I know is, he better do
		what he's supposed to do.
		확실한 건 데이먼은
		엘레나를 놓아줘야 해
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:04	He'll do it.
		그럴 거야
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:05	He's not as bad as
		he wants you to think.
		네가 생각하는 만큼
		나쁘지는 않아
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:08	He'll do
		what he needs to do.
		해야할 일을 
		할 거야
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	He told me he would.
		그러겠다고 했어
00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:11	Is that
		all he told you?
		그게 다야?
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	What do you mean?
		무슨 소리야?
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	Nothing. It's just...
		It's just...
		아무것도
		그냥...
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	How can you trust him?
		어떻게 
		데이먼을 믿어?
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:28	Because I think he loves
		her as much as I do.
		형도 나만큼
		엘레나를 사랑해
00:39:31	 
		 
00:39:31	He can't be selfish
		with her, not anymore.
		엘레나에게는
		이기적일 수 없어
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:39	 
		 
00:39:49	Hey. We're back.
		- 왔어요?
		- 응
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	How was your night?
		어땠어요?
00:39:56	 
		 
00:39:56	Awful. Yours? Same.
		- 최악이야, 넌?
		- 저도요
00:40:02	 
		 
00:40:03	Elena, we need
		to talk.
		엘레나, 얘기 좀 해
00:40:06	 
		 
00:40:06	I know that
		I'm sired to you, Damon.
		나 종속된 거
		알아요, 데이먼
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:10	Caroline told me.
		캐롤라인이 말해줬어요
00:40:14	 
		 
00:40:14	That's what you and Stefan
		were doing, wasn't it?
		그래서 스테판이랑
		나갔던 거죠?
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:18	Is there a way
		to break it?
		방법이 있어요?
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:22	Not exactly...
		아니
00:40:23	 
		 
00:40:25	Which is why
		we need to talk.
		그래서 얘기를
		해야하는 거야
00:40:27	 
		 
00:40:27	Tyler told me the bond
		doesn't affect how I feel,
		타일러가 종속이 감정을
		바꾸지는 못한대요
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:29	just the way I act.
		행동뿐이죠
00:40:31	 
		 
00:40:31	My feelings for you
		haven't changed, Damon.
		내 감정은 변하지
		않았어요, 데이먼
00:40:33	 
		 
00:40:33	Nothing has changed.
		어떤 것도요
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:34	Everything
		has changed, Elena.
		모든게
		달라졌어, 엘레나
00:40:36	 
		 
00:40:36	Ok. Fine. Yeah.
		I mean, I've changed.
		알았어요
		난 달라졌죠
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:41	So have you, Damon,
		and I'm happy,
		당신도요, 데이먼
		난 행복해요
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:45	just like you were
		yesterday morning
		우리가 이걸
		알기 전
00:40:47	 
		 
00:40:47	before we knew
		about any of this.
		어제 아침 당신이
		그랬던 것 처럼요
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:48	You know what would
		make me happy?
		뭐가 날 행복하게
		하는 지 알아?
00:40:50	 
		 
00:40:50	To know that
		this entire time
		지난 시간 동안
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:52	that I've been completely
		in love with you
		나에 대한 네 
		감정이 나만큼
00:40:53	 
		 
00:40:53	that what you actually
		felt for me was real.
		진실되었다는 걸
		아는 거야
00:40:56	 
		 
00:40:56	It is real.
		I know that it is, Damon.
		진짜였어요
		정말이에요, 데이먼
00:40:58	 
		 
00:40:58	I know what you're
		about to do.
		지금 당신이
		뭘 하려는지 알아요
00:41:00	 
		 
00:41:00	Please don't
		do this to me.
		제발 이러지 마요
00:41:01	 
		 
00:41:01	I don't want
		to do this, Elena.
		나도 이러기
		싫어, 엘레나
00:41:05	 
		 
00:41:05	I'm not the good guy,
		remember?
		난 좋은 사람이
		아냐, 기억해?
00:41:07	 
		 
00:41:07	I'm the selfish one.
		I take what I want.
		난 이기적인 놈이야
		원하는 걸 가지지
00:41:10	 
		 
00:41:10	I do what I want.
		I lie to my brother.
		원하는 대로 하고
		동생한테 거짓말하고
00:41:12	 
		 
00:41:12	I fall in love
		with his girl.
		동생의 여자와
		사랑에 빠지지
00:41:13	 
		 
00:41:13	I don't do
		the right thing...
		난 올바른 일을
		하지 않는다고!
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:21	다만 너에 관한 건
		어쩔 수 없어
00:41:23	 
00:41:28	이게 잘못된 것
		같아요?
00:41:30	 
00:41:39	이게 잘못된 것
		같냐구요
