		어머니랑 아버지 생각이
		부쩍 들더라고
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:19	I was wondering. You said that you

00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:45	Do you think that's her real name?

00:02:46	 
		 
00:02:46	Pregnant teenage runaway?Probably not.
		가출한 10대 임산부가?
		당연히 실명이 아니겠지
00:02:49

00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	But where'd she get peterson?
		Classmate? Best friend?
		어떻게 피터슨을 붙였을까?

00:04:18	I don't know. I...
		I--I don't know.
		모르겠어.. 정말..
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:25	If it's true and they
		are the same person,
		사실이고 정말
		같은 사람이 맞다면
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	That means that my birth mother is dead,
		그 뜻은 우리 엄마가
		돌아가셨단 거잖아
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	And I don't know if I could handle that.

00:04:42	Just that she was killed and
		the case was never solved.
		 
		살해당했지만 그 사건이
		해결이 안됐단것만 알아
00:04:45

		구하려던 캐더린은 안에 없었는데
		아직 왜 안떠나는가?
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	No,it's so liberating
		not having a master plan,
		거대한 계획이 없어지니
		해방된 느낌이야
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	Because I can do
		whatever the hell I want.
		내가 원하는건 뭐든
		할 수 있거든
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	That's kind of what I'm afraid of.

		- 저 여자들은?
		- 두통을 안고 기숙사로 돌아갈걸
00:06:47

		평소처럼 말야
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	Predictable you didn't pull
		me over here for a pep talk.
		여기까지 불러놓곤
		격려의 말은 안해줄줄 알았어
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	So drink up. Spill it,brother.
		그러니까 마셔
		다 털어놓으라고
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:59	There was a woman you may
		have known a few years back
		몇년 전에 알았을지 모르는
		여자가 있어

		- 죽였잖아
		- 본론이 뭐야?
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	I just--just wanna know if you
		remember anything about her.
		단지.. 그녀에 대해
		기억나는거 없나 해서
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	Oh,it's like a needle

		바늘찾기 같은거야
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	Well,think hard. It's important.
		곰곰히 생각해봐
		중요하다구
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:21	Nothing is important,not anymore.
		나한테 중요한건 없어
		이제는 말야
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:26	Great chat.
		얘기 즐거웠어
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	I have to go and exploit some
		women in the name of grief,
		가서 슬퍼하는 여성들을
		이용해 먹여야 하거든
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	Which I'm sure you understand.
		너도 이해할거야
00:07:33

00:07:50	But we have this entire
		house to ourselves.
		하지만 이 집엔
		우리밖에 없어
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	I mean,it's practically a bachelor pad.
		싱글남들이 꿈꾸던 기회야
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	And...
		그리고...
00:07:59

		버린거 말이죠
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	In this town,Fundraising is
		like indentured servitude.
		이 동네에서, 자선 모금은
		노예 계약과 같아요
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	You don't have a choice.
		Besides,you're a bachelor,

00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	I wanted to talk to you
		about isobel flemming.
		이자벨 플레밍이란 분에 대해
		여쭤보려고 왔어요
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	Well,I haven't heard that name in years.
		그 이름 들은지 참 오래됐네요
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:50	How do you know her?
		어떻게 알죠?
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:52	I think that,um,well...
		제 생각에..
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:57	Do you know if she had a baby
		that she gave up for adoption?
		혹시 그분이 입양기관에
		아이를 맡겼는지 아시나요?
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:03	My god. You're her daughter.
		세상에. 이자벨 딸이군요
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:12	I was just gonna make some
		tea. Would you like some?
		차 좀 끓일건데
		그쪽도 마실래요?
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	- Sure.

		- 물론요
		- 부엌은 이쪽이에요
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:29	I wasn't gonna come.
		I didn't think I was,
		원래 오려고 안했어요
		오지 않을거라 생각했죠
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	But I was driving,and
		I hit this stoplight,
		하지만 운전을 하다가
		정지 신호등을 마주했고
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	And it made me think about when I was learning
		How to drive and then my mom would always warn me
		운전하는 법을 배울때
		엄마가 늘 그랬는데
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	About this blind turn
		on the left-hand side,
		왼쪽 편에 막다른 차도가
		있을 거라 경고했거요
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	And then I was thinking
		about my mom,and--
		그러다가 엄마 생각이 났고..
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:46	I had your address. I'm
		sorry for barging in.
		주소를 찾았어요
		이렇게 쳐들어와 죄송해요
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:48	It's no problem. Just a surprise,though.
		괜찮아요
		놀랍긴 하지만요
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	I haven't thought about isobel in years.
		이자벨을 기억한게
		참 오래 되었죠
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	When was the last time you saw her?
		마지막으로 언제
		제 생모를 보셨죠?
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	About 17 years ago,When
		she left to go have you.
		17년 전에
		당신을 낳으려고 떠날때 봤죠
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	We kept in touch for a while,But,well,you
		know,people drift apart.
		잠깐 연락하고 지내다가
		늘 그렇듯 사람사이는 소원해지죠
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	And you don't know where she ended up?
		그 후에 어디로
		가셨는지 모르시나요?
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	She was in florida for a while.
		한동안은 플로리다에 있었죠
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	She was on her own.
		I know it wasn't easy.
		혼자였어요
		쉽지 않았을거에요
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:15	Do you have any idea who my father is?
		우리 아버지가 누군지
		혹시 아시나요?
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:21	I could never get her to fess up.
		그건 절대 나한테도
		털어놓지 않았어요
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:26	Anyway,she finally pulled it together,
		사실 마침내
		마음을 추스리고
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	Got into college on a scholarship.
		장학금을 받고
		대학에 들어갔죠
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	- Where did she go?
		- Somewhere in north carolina.
		- 어디로 가셨나요?
		- 노스캐롤라이나에요
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	Duke,I think. Smart girl,smart school.
		듀크대학교 였을거에요
		똑똑한 여성한테 맞는 학교죠
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	Let me just grab that.

		적어도 뭐 하는지는
		알려줄 수 있잖아
00:15:59	 
		 
00:16:08	I was doing research,And
		I dug up all this stuff
		조사 중이야
		정보를 캐고 있지
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	About this small town in
		virginia near where I grew up.
		내가 자란 버지니아의 시골
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	It's isolated,out of the way,and quiet,
		고립되어 있고
		조용한 곳이지만
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	And every now and
		then,people die mysteriously,
		가끔씩 사람들이
		미스터리하게 죽어갔어
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	And they say that it's animal attacks.
		동물의 습격이라고들 했지
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	Except,these bodies
		are drained of blood.
		시체엔 피가 말라 있었지만
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:27	It's vampires. It has to be.
		뱀파이어 짓이야
		그래야만 해
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	Ok. I'll get my garlic and holy water,
		내가 마늘하고
		성수 준비할게
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	- And then maybe,just maybe...
		- No.
		- 그럼 어쩌면..
		- 안돼
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	- We can get some sleep. Come here.
		-No.
		- 잠 좀 자자. 어서

00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	Look,this is why I love you,
		그래서 당신을 사랑하는 거야
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	Because you believe
		in all of this stuff,
		이런 모든 미신을 믿으니까
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	So much so that you're
		making a degree out of it.
		그래서 그걸 가지고
		학위도 따냈지
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	You're like mulder,except
		hotter and a girl.
		엑스파일 멀더같아
		섹시한 여자란거만 빼면
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	This is not a joke,rick.
		농담 아니야, 릭
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:57	You think that this is
		cute,But I'm gonna prove it.
		귀여운 거 같지만
		내가 증명할거야
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:09	And mulder was right in the end.
		엑스파일에서도
		결국 멀더 말이 맞았다구
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:13	Ah. They came to the games for us.
		우리 보려고
		다들 경기장에 왔죠
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	The football team hadn't won in years.
		풋볼팀은 몇년간
		우승을 못했으니까
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	We were the stars. Well,izzie was.
		우리가 스타였죠
		아니 이자벨이
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	But I was a damn good backup.
		난 참 든든한
		뒷받침이 되주었죠
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	Heh. This is great. Thank you.
		말씀 정말 고마워요

00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:46	You know. Know what?
		- 아는군요?
		- 뭘요?
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	You didn't invite me in,And
		you're serving vervain tea.
		날 들어오란 말씀 안하시고
		마편초 든 차를 대접하고
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	You know.
		아시는군요
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:57	I think that you should probably leave.
		이제 가보셔야겠어요
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	Wait. What are you not telling me?
		말 안하시는게 뭐죠?
00:18:00

		대부분의 일이 그렇죠

		- 잠깐 바람좀 쐴래
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:27	- Elena.
		- He killed her?
		- 엘레나
		- 그가 죽인거야?
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	Damon was the vampire that killed her?
		생모를 죽인 뱀파이어가
		데이먼이었어?
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:31	I don't know what happened. Alaric
		said that they never found the body.
		어떻게 된건진 몰라
		알라릭이 그러길 시체는 못찾았대
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	Oh,my god. Stefan.
		세상에, 스테판
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you,
		미안해
		말하고 싶었는데
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	But I just-- I
		wanted to know more.
		더 알고 나서
		말하고 싶었어
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:40	I was feeling sorry for him,
		정말 안됐다고 느꼈거든
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:42	Hoping that this whole
		katherine thing would change him.
		캐더린 일 때문에
		변하기를 바랐어
00:29:45	 
		 
00:29:45	I'm so stupid.
		정말 바보같지
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:46	He doesn't know about
		the connection to you.
		너랑 연관된건 몰라
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	I thought about confronting
		him,but he's already so on edge.
		사실을 들이댈까도 생각해봤는데
		불안정한 상태라서
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	Why are you protecting him?
		왜 데이먼을 감싸고 도는거야?
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	Because you're not the only one
		hoping that he might actually change.
		그가 바뀌리라 바랬던건
		너 뿐이 아녔거든
00:29:57	 
		 
00:30:04	That man.
		저 남자
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:07	I saw that man outside of trudie's.
		트루디씨 집 밖에서 봤어
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	Get back inside. Come on.
		안으로 들어가자. 어서
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:17	And bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.

		알라릭 면전에

00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:02	What?
		뭐라고?
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	Just as I was starting to think that
		there Was something redeemable about you.
		당신이 속죄할수 있으리라
		생각을 했었는데
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	- Elena.
		- Am I missing something here?
		- 엘레나
		- 내가 뭐 빼먹은거 있나?
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	Did I forget to mention
		earlier when we were talking
		제가 까먹었나본데
		오늘 아침에 제가
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:12	About my birth mother,The
		one that gave me up?
		절 버리고 떠난
		생모에 대해 얘기했었죠?
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:15	Her name was isobel.
		생모 이름이 이자벨이었어요
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:20	Go ahead. Reminisce
		about how you killed her.
		계속 해봐요. 어떻게
		죽였는지 추억에 잠겨봐요
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:37	Come on. Let's get you home.
		집에 데려다줄게
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:39	I have a message for you.
		너한테 전할 메세지가 있다
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:40	- What?
		- Who are you?
		- 뭐라고요?
		- 누구세요?
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	- Stop looking.
		- Stop looking for what?
		- 찾는건 그만둬
		- 뭘 말씀하시는거죠?
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:45	She doesn't want to know you.
		She doesn't want to talk to you.
		그녀는 널 알고 싶지 않아해
		너랑 얘기하고 싶지도 않고
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:49	Isobel?
		이자벨요?
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	You need to stop looking.
		Do you understand?
		이젠 그만 찾아봐
		알았나?
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	She's alive? Does
		that mean she's a--
		살아있나요?
		그 뜻은 생모가..
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:56	Elena,he's under a compulsion.
		엘레나, 저분은
		주문에 걸린거야
00:31:57	 
		 
00:31:57	- Do you understand?
		- Yes. I do.
		- 알겠나?
		- 네
00:31:59	 
		 
00:31:59	Good.
		좋아

		저것 좀 봐요
		37552번이네요
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	What are the chances? Me.
		이런 우연이
		바로 저였군요
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:49	- Where'd he go?
		- I'm gonna call you later.
		- 데이먼은 어디 갔죠?
		- 나중에 전화할게요
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:58	I think it's time to
		let this vampire crap go.
		뱀파이어에 관한 연구는
		그만 멈출때야
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	I mean,the research,the
		trips,it's become an obsession.
		뱀파이어 조사와 여행은
		집착이 되가고 있어
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:03	Well,this is important to me,rick.
		나한테 중요한거야
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	Why? Why is it so important?
		왜? 왜 그리 중요한데?
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	Explain it to me. I
		mean,make me understand.
		설명해봐
		이해할수 있게
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:13	I mean,what's the point of this?
		뭐하자는 거야?
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	You don't want kids.
		You're barely ever home.
		아이도 원치 않고
		집에도 잘 안오고
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:18	I just want us to be normal people.
		난 평범한 사람이
		되고 싶어
00:33:20	Maybe I don't want to.
		 
		난 그러고 싶지 않아
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	Maybe I want more.
		그 이상을 원하나봐
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:32	Here we go. Home,sweet home.
		여기 다 왔어요
		즐거운 우리집
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:34	Wait. Why--why are we back
		here?I wasn't ready to leave.
		잠깐. 왜 돌아왔지?
		아직 떠날 준비 안됐는데
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	Yeah,you were,mom.
		아뇨, 가셔야 했죠
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:42	- You're the best,matty.
		- I know.
		- 네가 최고다, 맷
		- 알아요
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:45	I'm--I'm sorry...
		I was gone so long.
		미안하다
		너무 오래 떨어져 있었지
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:54	Why are you really home,mom?
		정말 집에 온
		이유가 뭐에요?
00:33:57	 
		 
00:34:00	It's pete. He's gone,
		피트 때문이야
		날 떠났어
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	And it's all my fault.
		I did it. I always do it.
		다 내 잘못이야
		내가 그랬어. 난 늘 그러지
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	No,you didn't,mom. It's not your fault.
		아니에요
		엄마 탓이 아니라구요
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:16	You're all I have left.
		나한테 남은건
		너밖에 없단다
00:34:18	 
		 
00:34:20	- Please don't leave me.
		- I'm not goin' anywhere.
		- 제발 날 떠나지 마
		- 난 아무대도 안가요
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:48	Are you really this stupid?
		정말 이렇게 멍청해?
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:56	Guess so.
		그런가봐
00:34:57	 
		 
00:35:07	You gonna put down the stake?
		말뚝으로 날 찍을건가?
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:10	- That's courage.
		- Where's isobel?
		- 용감한데
		- 이자벨 어딨어?
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:14	What have you done to my wife?
		내 아내한테
		무슨 짓을 한거냐고?
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	You want me to tell you I killed
		her? Would that make you happy?
		내가 죽였단걸 듣길 바래?
		그러면 만족하실꺼야?
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:18	Because I think you know what happened.
		어떻게 된건지는
		너도 잘 알텐데
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	- I saw you feeding on her.
		- Yeah. I did,and I wasn't lying.
		- 피를 먹이는거 봤어
		- 그래, 그랬지. 거짓말 아냐
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:24	She was delicious.
		맛있더군
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:30	Oh,come on. What do you think happened?
		무슨 일이 생겼으리라 생각해?
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	Not an inkling?
		조금이라도
		눈치 못채겠어?
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:34	Never considered the possibility?
		그 가능성은 생각
		안해본거야?
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:38	I turned her.
		내가 뱀파이어로
		만들어줬어
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:41	Why?
		왜?
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	She came to me,all
		pathetic,Looking for vampires.
		뱀파이어를 찾다가 가엾은
		모습으로 나한테 왔어
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	There was something about
		her,Something I liked.
		뭔가 특별한게 있더라
		맘에 들었지
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	- There was something special.
		- You turned her because you liked her?
		- 뭔가 특별했어
		- 그녀가좋아서 뱀파이어를 만든거야?
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	No,I slept with her because I liked her.
		아니, 좋아해서
		같이 잤던거지
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	I turned her because she begged me to.
		나한테 간청을 하길래
		뱀파이어로 만들어준거야
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:58	Yeah. But you knew that,too,didn't you?
		그래. 하지만 그건
		알고 있었잖아?
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:02	Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home,
		가정에 만족하지 않았나봐
00:36:04	 
		 
00:36:04	Wasn't happy with life in general,
		인생 자체에
		만족하질 않았지
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:07	Wasn't happy with you.
		당신한테 만족하지도 않았고
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:13	Ah,this is a shame.
		안됐어
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:15	We're kindred spirits,abandoned
		by the women we love.
		사랑하는 여자들한테
		버림받은 영혼들이야
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	Unrequited love sucks.
		짝사랑은 엿같지
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:22	Sounds like I got a lung.
		사람같은 말을 했군
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:25	Which means I get to sit
		here and watch you die.
		그럼 여기 앉아
		죽는걸 봐야 겠지
00:36:27	 
		 
00:37:15	What happened? What did you do?
		무슨 일이야?
		어떻게 한거냐고?
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	- Dude,what? He attacked me.
		- Damon.
		- 날 먼저 공격했다구
		- 데이먼
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:23	All I did was tell him the truth.
		His wife didn't want him anymore.
		난 사실만 얘기했을 뿐야
		아내가 그를 원치 않았단걸
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.
		그 사실을 감당 못한건
		내 잘못이 아냐
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:28	Like you've been handling katherine?
		형은 캐더린 일을
		감당 잘하셨고?
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:30	I'm handling it fine. You know what?
		난 잘 감당하고 있어
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:36	Isobel came to me. She found me.
		이자벨이 나한테 왔어
		날 찾아냈다구
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:38	And if she's related to elena,
		엘레나의 생모가 맞다면
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:40	That means she's related to katherine.
		캐더린하고
		연관됐다는 뜻이지
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:41	Maybe katherine sent her to me.
		캐더린이 그녀를
		나한테 보냈나봐
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.
		그만해. 계속 찾아볼 필요 없다고
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	Can't be a coincidence
		isobel sought me out.
		이자벨이 날 찾아낸건
		우연이 아닐수도 있어
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	Can't.
		그렇잖아
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:53	I'm assuming you'll take care of this.
		이 일은 네가 처리할거지?
00:37:55	 
		 
00:38:27	What happened? What's going on?
		어떻게 된거죠?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	You were just... Did damon turn you?
		당신 방금..
		데이먼이 뱀파이어로 만들었나요?
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:37	No. I went for him,And
		then he stabbed me.
		아니, 찾아갔는데
		날 말뚝으로 찔렀어
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:42	No,no,no. You must have vampire blood in
		your system.Somebody slipped it to you.
		아뇨, 당신 몸속에 뱀파이어 피가
		들어갔나봐요. 누군가 음료에 탔는지도
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:45	No. It's... it's something else.
		아뇨.. 다른 거에요
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:50	- Then how?
		- I...
		- 그럼 어떻게?
		- 난..
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:56	Isobel.
		이자벨
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:59	Surprise gifts aren't fair.
		깜짝 선물은
		불공평하잖아
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:01	I always feel bad for
		not getting you something.
		당신한테 뭐 못사준거
		미안하게 생각했는데
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	Just open it.
		그냥 열어봐
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	Oh,that's a giant piece of jewelry.
		정말 알 굵은 반지인데
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	I know. It's ridiculous. Just
		tell people it's a family heirloom.
		알아. 웃기지
		조상이 물려준거라고 말해
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	- Nobody questions that.
		- Where'd you get this?
		- 아무도 의심 안할거야
		- 어디서 구했어?
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:16	If I told you,you'd laugh at me.
		말해주면 비웃을거야
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:19	But promise me that
		you'll always wear it.
		하지만 항상 끼고 다니겠다고 맹세해줘
00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:22	It'll protect you from all the
		things that go bump in the night.
		밤에 위험한 일이 생기면
		당신을 지켜줄거야
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:26	A ring to ward off the demons,eh?
		악마를 격퇴하는 반지?
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:28	Consider it a-- a
		token of my love,
		내 사랑의 징표로 생각해
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:32	My affection,and if nothing
		else,An apology for being so crazy.
		나의 사랑. 또
		미친짓에 대한 사과 선물로
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	Well,you were definitely crazy.
		당신 정말 미친게 맞아
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	I'm selfish,and I'm
		obsessed,And I'm a horrible wife.
		이기적에다가 집착이 심하고
		아내 역할 꽝이지
00:39:44	 
		 
00:39:45	But you love me anyway.
		그래도 당신은 날 사랑하잖아
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	Yes,I do.
		그래
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:52	This ring protected me.
		이 반지가
