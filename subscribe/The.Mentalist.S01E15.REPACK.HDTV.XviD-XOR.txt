00:08:31	And we are... Doing fine.
		실제로도..
		잘 살고 있습니다
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	Did anybody at the party
		behave in an unusual manner?
		파티 참석자 중에서 눈에 띄는
		행동을 하는 사람은 없었습니까?
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	- Any odd incidents?
		- No.
		- 이상한 사건이라도?
		- 아니오
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	And you knew everybody
		at the party personally?
		파티 참석자들 모두
		개인적으로 아는 사이셨고요?
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	Yes,good friends.
		네, 친한 친구들입니다
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	Oh,we're gonna need a list.
		그 명단이 필요하겠습니다
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:44	Sure. From the country club, mostly.
		물론입니다, 대부분
		컨츄리 클럽 사람들이죠
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	Scarlett was elected chair of
		her women's committee there.
		스칼렛이 거기
		여성회 의장이었어요
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	It's a big deal in this
		community, very prestigious.
		이쪽 세계에서는 꽤 큰 자리죠
		굉장히 명성 높은 자리입니다
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	I was so proud of her, but it meant she had
		to spend a lot more time at-- at the club.
		전 정말 자랑스러웠어요
00:08:56	I was so proud of her, but it meant she had
		to spend a lot more time at-- at the club.
		 
00:08:56	I was so proud of her, but it meant she had
		to spend a lot more time at-- at the club.
		물론 그래서 클럽에서
		보내는 시간은 많았지만..
00:09:00	I was so proud of her, but it meant she had
		to spend a lot more time at-- at the club.
		 
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:02	Oscar. Stop. Please.
		오스카, 그만하거라
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	Pardon me. Um,are we done here?
		죄송합니다
		이제 다 됐나요?
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	No,that's all for now. we'll be
		in touch if we need anything else.
		네, 혹시 필요한 게 생기면
		연락드리겠습니다
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:14	Very nice.
		정말 근사하네요
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:24	What's your deal with asra hadami?
		아까 아즈라 얘기는 왜?
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Well,you saw the dinner theater
		way in which she hugged victor.
		그 사람 빅터와 포옹할 때
		과장된 모습 봤잖아
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	She's deceiving him.
		그 여자 빅터를
		속이고 있어
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	I thought it was a love
		affair gone awry,but it isn't.
		난 불륜이 틀어진 줄
		알았는데 아냐
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	It's something else.
		다른 뭔가가 있어
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	She's probably stealing from him.
		아마 저 사람 돈을
		훔치는 걸 거야
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	I'll have van pelt pull her financials
		at the same time she pulls the marquesas'.
		밴펠트가 마퀘이사 집안
		재정 내역을 뽑을 때
00:09:39	I'll have van pelt pull her financials
		at the same time she pulls the marquesas'.
		 
00:09:39	I'll have van pelt pull her financials
		at the same time she pulls the marquesas'.
		저 여자 것도 같이
		뽑으라고 할게
00:09:41	 
		저 여자 것도 같이
		뽑으라고 할게
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	You know,we should go take
		a look at this country club.
		그 컨츄리 클럽이란데도
		가봐야겠다
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	Yeah,talk to the women's committee
		she chairs. Bring rigsby with you.
		그래, 릭스비 데리고
		여성회 회원들을 만나봐

		여기 누군가는
		진실을 알겠네요
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	And how so?
		그래? 
		왜 그렇게 생각하지?
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	Well,poison and a message in lipstick
		says this murder was done by a woman.
		독극물에, 립스틱으로 쓴
		메세지..이건 여자 소행이에요
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	And women have no
		secrets from other women.
		여자들 사이에
		비밀이란 없죠
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:07	Well,unless it was a cunning
		man posing as a woman.
		여자인 척 하는
		교활한 남자일 수도 있어
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	- What,you think?
		- No.

00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	We'll try. Uh,were you
		all at scarlett's party?
		최선을 다 하겠습니다
		모두 어제 파티에 오셨나요?
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	Yes.
		네
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	Yes,we all have to go to the
		chairwoman's parties. It's a rule.
		네, 의장의 파티에는 모두
		참석하는 게 규칙이에요
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	The chairwoman is a
		prestigious position,isn't it?
		의장은 굉장한 특권 직책이죠?
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	Oh,yes,it is.
		네, 그렇죠
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	She would make her fair
		share of enemies,i'd expect.
		그럼 나름 앙숙도 있었겠네요?
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:30	You could say that.
		그렇다고 할 수 있죠
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	If you have something to say, say it.
		할 말 있으면 해보시지
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	Speak your mind,bitch.
		솔직히 말애봐, 이 년아
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	Oh,okay. You want it all out there?
		어머, 그래
		전부 말해봐?
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:39	He asked about enemies,
		and that's what you were.
		이 분이 앙숙이 있는지 
		물었는데, 그게 너였지
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	She hated scarlett because she wanted to be chair,
		and scarlett whipped her butt in the election.
		얘는 스칼렛을 정말 싫어했어요
00:11:45	She hated scarlett because she wanted to be chair,
		and scarlett whipped her butt in the election.
		 
00:11:45	She hated scarlett because she wanted to be chair,
		and scarlett whipped her butt in the election.
		자기가 의장이 되고 싶었는데
		선거에서 스칼렛에게 발렸거든요
00:11:48	 
		자기가 의장이 되고 싶었는데
		선거에서 스칼렛에게 발렸거든요
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:48	Schooled her,right,mandy?
		엄청 쪽팔렸지
		안그래, 맨디?
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Oh,I'm not getting into this one.
		난 제발 빼줘
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	Right. I missed out on scoring the private office
		with all that cool stationery with my name on it.
		그래요, 제 이름을 새긴
		근사한 사무용품이랑요
00:11:54	Right. I missed out on scoring the private office
		with all that cool stationery with my name on it.
		 
00:11:54	Right. I missed out on scoring the private office
		with all that cool stationery with my name on it.
		개인 사무실을 못 갖은게
		그렇게 분해서..
00:11:57	 
		개인 사무실을 못 갖은게
		그렇게 분해서..
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	So I killed her.
		그래서 제가 죽였어요
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Have you any idea how idiotic you sound?
		너 그렇게 머저리같은
		말이나 하고 다닐래?
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	You're the idiot.
		머저리는 너거든
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	Tell you what. It's probably best if we
		conduct interviews with each of you separately.
		면담은 따로 진행하는 게
		좋을 것 같네요
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	You're always so jealous of everybody.
		넌 왜 뭐든지
		그렇게 질투가 심해?
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:10	Do you rember anything odd
		happening the night of the party?
		파티에서 미심쩍은
		일은 없었나요?
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	I don't know. It was just the
		usual mojitos and chitchat,but...
		그냥 평소처럼 쿠바식
		칵테일과 담소가 오갔죠
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:19	But what?
		그런데요?
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	I don't know if I should tell you this, but
		i-i saw scarlett arguing with asra hadami.
		이런 말 드려도
		될진 모르겠지만..
00:12:22	I don't know if I should tell you this, but
		i-i saw scarlett arguing with asra hadami.
		 
00:12:23	I don't know if I should tell you this, but
		i-i saw scarlett arguing with asra hadami.
		스칼렛이 아즈라와
		말다툼하는 걸 봤어요
00:12:25	I don't know if I should tell you this, but
		i-i saw scarlett arguing with asra hadami.
		 
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	It looked kind of angry.
		꽤 화가 나보였어요
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	Some say something more than business might be
		going on between asra hadami and victor marquesa.
		빅터와 아즈라 사이가
		동업자 이상이란 소문이 있는데
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	I don't know if that's true, and
		I don't really follow the gossip.
		저도 그게 사실인지는 몰라요
		소문을 챙겨 듣는 편이 아니라서요
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	 
		흠.. 누가 챙겨듣죠?
00:12:36	Who does?
		흠.. 누가 챙겨듣죠?
00:12:37	Who does?
		 
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	We're told you're the
		gossip queen around here.
		당신이 이 동네의
		가십 여왕이라고 들었는데요
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	People tell me things.
		사람들이 이것저것
		말해주더라고요
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:45	So... Who's having an
		affair with victor marquesa?
		그럼..빅터 마퀘이사와
		바람피는 상대는 누굴까요?
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	I don't know. Who? Tell.
		모르겠어요
		누구에요? 말해주세요
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Asra hadami?
		아즈라 하다미?
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:56	That's a funny idea?
		그게 웃겨요?
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	No,it's just... No.
		아뇨, 단지..
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	Victor and asra are good
		friends,nothing more.
		아뇨, 빅터와 아즈라는
		친구사이일 뿐이에요
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	- Asra had nothing to do with this.
		- No?
		- 아즈라는 전혀 상관 없어요
		- 그래요?
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:07	What's the general
		opinion? Who did this?
		사람들 생각은 대체로 어때요?
		누구 짓이죠?
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	- My guess?
		- Yeah.
		- 제 생각에는요
		- 네
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	Victor.
		빅터에요
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	What makes you think that?
		왜죠?
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	Nothing,really. I mean,victor's a nice
		guy, but that's who kills women, isn't it?
		그냥요, 빅터가 사람은 좋은데
		보통 이럴땐 남편이 범인이잖아요?
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	Their husbands,90% of the time.
		90%는 남편이라던데
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	70%,i think.
		70%일 겁니다
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:25	He's right.
		저 사람 말이 맞아요
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:41	That was some great play.
		아주 잘하시네요
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	You could maybe do a little more topspin on
		your returns, but it was a very nice play.
		리턴할 때 톱스핀을 좀
		더 해도 되겠지만, 잘 하시네요
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	The answers are yes,i disliked
		her, no,i didn't kill her.
		답변은 "네, 그 여자가 싫었어요
		아니오, 죽이지 않았어요" 에요
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	You hate to lose,don't you?
		당신 정말 지기
		싫어하시는군요?
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	Yes,unlike all those
		many people that love it.
		네, 다들 지는걸
		좋아하던데 전 달라요
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:57	- I'm in the semifinals, for god sake.
		- Yeah. Oh,of course.
		- 무려 준결승에 나갔다고요
		- 아, 그렇죠
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	Good luck with that.
		잘 하세요
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	Yeah,i have to go.
		네, 가봐야겠어요
00:14:03

00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:24	Really? Why?
		그래요? 왜죠?
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	She's having an affair with victor.
		그 사람 빅터랑 바람 피니까요
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:28	How do you know that?
		그건 어떻게 아셨어요?
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	I just have an eye for that stuff.
		전 그냥 그런데 예리해요
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	Asra must have killed scarlett so
		that she could have victor for herself.
		아즈라가 빅터를 차지하려고
		스칼렛을 죽인 게 분명해요
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	Don't know why. If you
		ask me,he's a loser.
		왜 그럴까 모르겠어요
		제가 보기엔 빅터는 찌질한데
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	Well,thank you.
		감사해요
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	Oh,by the way,if you disliked scarlett marquesa so
		much, why are you wearing earrings that she made?
		근데 말이죠
00:14:41	Oh,by the way,if you disliked scarlett marquesa so
		much, why are you wearing earrings that she made?
		 
00:14:41	Oh,by the way,if you disliked scarlett marquesa so
		much, why are you wearing earrings that she made?
		스칼렛이 그렇게 싫으면서
		그 사람 귀걸이는 왜 하셨나요?
00:14:44	 
		스칼렛이 그렇게 싫으면서
		그 사람 귀걸이는 왜 하셨나요?
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	She makes good earrings.
		It's nice to meet you.
		그 사람 귀걸이는
		잘 만드니까요
00:14:46	She makes good earrings.
		It's nice to meet you.
		 
00:14:47	She makes good earrings.
		It's nice to meet you.
		만나서 반가웠어요
00:14:49	 
		만나서 반가웠어요
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:53	Nice meeting you,too.
		저도 만가웠어요
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:57	You two were close, weren't you?
		두 분이서 친하셨죠?
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	We were very close.
		저희는 정말 친했어요
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	Being her deputy in the women's
		committee, we spoke every day.
		저는 부의장이라 둘이서
		매일 이야기를 나눴거든요
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Uh,did you notice anything, uh,different,
		about,uh, your conversations?
		그렇게 이야기하시던 중에
		이상한 점은 없었습니까?
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:08	She talked a lot about moving away.
		이사 이야기를 많이 했어요
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	She was so tired of
		keeping up at all costs.
		곧죽어도 뒤쳐지는 건
		안되는 이런 삶에 지쳤거든요
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	At all costs?
		곧죽어도요?
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	- Just working so hard.
		- Do you have a key for this?
		- 정말 뼈빠지게 일했어요
		- 이거 열쇠 있으십니까?
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	Oh,no. Only scarlett has a key.
		아뇨, 열쇠는
		스칼렛만 갖고 있어요
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	This is the chairwoman's office,
		and that's the chairwoman's safe.
		여긴 의장 사무실이고
		저건 의장 금고니까요
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:24	That makes sense.
		그렇겠네요
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	I don't know anything about that.
		저는 저거에 대해선
		아는 바가 없어요
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	Scarlett's keys are
		missing. That's interesting.
		스칼렛의 열쇠도 없어졌는데
		이거 흥미롭군
00:15:31	 
		스칼렛의 열쇠도 없어졌는데
		이거 흥미롭군
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:34	We need to get that safe open.
		그 금고 열어야겠는데
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	We're gonna need a
		search warrant for that.
		그러려면
		수색 영장이 있어야돼
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	I'm on it.
		제가 구해올게요
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	Did you get anything
		from scarlett's friends?
		스칼렛 친구들한테선
		뭘 알아냈어?
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	Well,everybody has a different theory.
		뭐, 저마다 생각이 다르더라
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	They're all hiding
		something. I don't know what.
		다들 하나씩 숨기고 있고
		그게 뭔지는 모르겠어
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Did you hear anything from forensics
		about the lipstick on the napkin?
		냅킨에 묻은 립스틱
		검사 결과는?
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	Not yet. They're jammed
		up, as usual. Budget cuts.
		아직요, 오늘도 한참 순서가
		밀렸어요, 예산이 문제죠
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Boss,i just now got access
		to asra hadami's financials.
		방금 아즈라 하다미
		재정 기록을 찾았는데요
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	She cleared out her bank
		accounts this morning.
		오늘 오전에 계좌
		잔고를 싹 비웠어요
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	Checking,savings-- took
		out about $125,000 in cash.
		예금, 저축계좌 모두 현금으로
		약 12만5천을 인출했어요
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	Going on the run maybe?
		도주라도 하려는 걸까?
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	She didn't happen to buy any
		rat poison recently,did she?
		최근에 쥐약을 샀다던가
		한 건 아니지?
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	That would be nice,but
		no. No record of it.
		그랬다면 좋았을 텐데
		그 기록은 없어요
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	That was the marsante
		security patrol calling.
		마르상테 보안 순찰대에서
		연락이 왔는데요
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	They just found hadami's
		house empty. She's gone.
		아즈라 하다미씨 집이
		텅 비었대요, 사라진 거에요
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	Great. A fugitive.
		도망자까지 나오고
		잘됐네
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	I-i know where she is.
		나, 나
		그 여자 어딨는지 알아

00:16:25	Cbi! Oy.
		CBI입니다!
		이런
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:36	Boss? I've been here nearly
		six months now,half a year.
		대장님, 저 여기 온 지도
		6개월인데, 반년 째에요
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	What do you want? Half a cake?
		그래서? 기념으로
		케잌 반 판 해줘?
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	I want to take lead on this interview.
		이번 심문은
		제가 맡고 싶어요
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:48	Okay.
		좋아
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:50	- Okay?
		- Yeah. Sure.
		- 정말요?
		- 그래, 그럼
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	Thanks,boss.
		고마워요, 대장님
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:59	Why were you running, miss hadami?
		왜 도주했나요, 하다미씨?
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	No reason. Stress. I need space.
		그냥 스트레스 때문에요
		휴식이 필요했어요
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	Nothing to do with the argument you had
		with scarlett marquesa the night she died?
		스칼렛이 죽던 날 두 분의
		말다툼하곤 상관없고요?
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	I didn't have an argument with her.
		그 사람과 다투지 않았어요
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	We hear differently.
		저희가 듣기론
		아니던데요
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	No argument.
		안 싸웠어요
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	I swear,i didn't kill
		her. This is absurd.
		맹세코 제가 안죽였어요
		이건 말도 안되요
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	No more absurd than you clearing out your
		accounts and abandoning your home for no reason.
		뜬금없이 계좌를 비우고 집을
		떠난 게 더 말이 안되죠
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	Maybe I need a lawyer.
		변호사가 필요한 것 같군요
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:25	Say the word.
		말만 하세요
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	What he'll tell you--if you're
		not involved in the murder--
		당신이 살인에 연루된 것만 아니면
		변호사도 이렇게 말할 거에요
00:17:30	 
		당신이 살인에 연루된 것만 아니면
		변호사도 이렇게 말할 거에요
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:32	Best speak up.
		털어놓는 게 최선이라고
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	I ran because I knew the murder would expose
		some issues that I would like to keep private.
		이번 사건으로..
00:17:36	I ran because I knew the murder would expose

		남들에게 숨기고 싶은 문제들이

00:17:39	 
		남들에게 숨기고 싶은 문제들이
		드러날 걸 알아서 도망간 거에요
00:17:39	Such as your relationship
		with mandy riljek?
		맨디 릴첵과의
		관계같은 거 말인가요?
00:17:39	Such as your relationship
		with mandy riljek?
		 
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	Exactly. News like
		that could be ruinous.
		그래요, 그런 소문이
		돌면 끝장이에요
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	True,but not the kind of thing
		you abandon your house for.
		그렇긴 하죠, 그래도 집까지
		버리고 도주할 정도는 아닌데요
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:48	You said "issues." What
		are the other issues?
		아까 "문제들"이라고 하셨죠
		다른 것들은 뭐가 있나요?
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:52	I didn't wanna have to
		look victor in the face
		저는 차마
		빅터와 대면해서..
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	And tell him i'd helped run everything
		he worked so hard for into the ground.
		그 사람이 쌓아올린 모든 것을
		제가 무너뜨렸다곤 말할 수 없었어요
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	How did you help do that?
		어떻게 무너뜨렸는데요?
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	I borrowed money from the
		company's cash reserve.
		회사 현금 준비금에서
		돈을 조금 빌렸어요
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	How much?
		얼마나요?
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	A little over half a million.
		50만 약간 넘게요
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	And where did it go?
		어디에 쓰셨는데요?
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	I made some poor investment
		choices that I had to cover quickly.
		투자를 몇 개 잘못 해서
		급히 메꿔야했어요
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	- So you stole--- -
		iborrowed from the reserve.
		- 그래서 훔친 거..
		- 준비금에서 빌린 거에요
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	I skimmed the money from
		each development deal that
		각각의 거래를
		성사시킬때 마다
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	should have gone into the
		company's reserve account as backup.
		예비용 현금 준비금으로
		들어가야 할 돈을 빼돌렸죠
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	We were making so many deals.
		저희는 거래를
		하도 많이 따냈기 때문에
00:18:22	 
		저희는 거래를
		하도 많이 따냈기 때문에
00:18:22	I knew i'd get it back
		before it would matter.
		저희는 거래를
		하도 많이 따냈기 때문에
00:18:23	I knew i'd get it back
		before it would matter.
		 
00:18:23	I knew i'd get it back
		before it would matter.
		별 문제가 되기 전에
		그 돈을 메꿀 줄 알았어요
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	But then the deals and the funding dried up,
		and suddenly,that reserve became very important.
		그런데 거래량과 자금이 말라붙더니
		갑자기 그 준비금이 엄청 중요해진 거에요
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:31	I sold anything I could get
		my hands on to cover the money.
		저는 뭐든 닥치는대로 팔아서
		그 돈을 마련하려고 했어요
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:46	Take a seat.
		앉으시죠
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	Why am I even here?
		I've done nothing wrong.
		왜 제가 여깄는 거에요?
		전 잘못한 거 없다고요
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	Be with you in just one moment.
		잠깐 금방 올게요
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:56	Please.
		앉으세요
00:18:58	 
		 
00:19:02	Well,you were found in a compromising
		position with a murder suspect.
		부인께선 살인용의자와 민망스런
		자세로 발견되셨잖아요
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	How did you know how to find us anyway?
		저희가 있는 곳은
		어떻게 찾으신 거에요?
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	You been spying on me?
		감시라도 했어요?
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	Well,you outbid patience for a romantic
		weekend, and your husband jim's away.
		페이션스를 제치고 낭만적인 주말 여행을
		입찰하셨는데, 남편분은 출장을 갔잖아요
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	And you laughed at the idea
		of victor and asra as lovers.
		게다가 빅터와 아즈라가
		애인 사이냐니까 비웃으셨죠
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:18	Nobody knows I'm here,right?
		제가 여기 온 건
		아무도 모르죠?
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	If this gets out,
		it'll be a huge scandal.
		이게 새어나가면
		엄청난 추문이 될 거에요
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	Nobody knows you're here.
		여기 오신 건
		아무도 모릅니다
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Sign this, and you're good to go.
		여기에 서명하시고
		바로 가시면 되세요
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:31	Judge's clerk says we won't get a search warrant
		for scarlett's safe until tomorrow morning.
		판사 비서 말이, 스칼렛씨 금고
		수색영장은 내일 아침에야 나온대
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	Then we'll go in and
		tear the place apart.
		그때 출동해서
		샅샅이 뒤지는 거야
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:37	Sorry.
		아, 미안
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:40	You didn't hear that. It's confidential.
		방금 그 말 못들으신 거에요
		이건 기밀이에요
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	Confidential? Oh,of course.
		기밀이요?
		아, 그럼요
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	No,seriously. Don't tell anyone,okay?
		진짜요, 아무한테도
		말하지 마세요, 아시겠죠?
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	I understand. May I leave now?
		알겠다고요
		이제 가봐도 될까요?
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	Yeah,please.
		네, 그럼요
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:55	Not bad. Your delivery was a bit wooden.
		쓸만한데요, 대사 전달이
		약간 뻣뻣했지만 말예요
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	Wooden? Me?
		뻣뻣해? 내가?
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Yeah, and you're marlon brando.
		그래, 너는 엄청
		말론 브란도다
		(전설적인 배우)
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:04	I can't believe it.
		믿을 수가 없군요
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	Asra's been with me for over five years.
		아즈라와 저는
		5년을 함께 했어요
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:09	I mean,she was with me in the trenches.
		힘든 시기도 함께
		헤쳐간 사람인데
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	I can't believe this.
		믿을 수가 없어요
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	After going over your accounts,
		we had a couple of questions.
		선생님 계좌를 훑어본 결과
		몇가지 질문이 있습니다
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	Sure.
		물어보세요
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	You've talked about cash
		crises in your business,
		사업 중 현금 위기를
		겪으셨다고 하셨는데
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	But regular cash deposits were made to your
		personal accounts, somewhere upwards of $5,000.
		선생님 개인 구좌에
		5천 달러를 웃도는 금액이
00:20:23	But regular cash deposits were made to your
		personal accounts, somewhere upwards of $5,000.
		 
00:20:23	But regular cash deposits were made to your
		personal accounts, somewhere upwards of $5,000.
		정기적으로 입금됐던데요
00:20:25	 
		정기적으로 입금됐던데요
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	Scarlett's deposits.
		집사람이 입금한 거 였어요
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	Oscar,come get your lunch.
		오스카, 와서
		점심 가져가너라
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	Those are some pretty hefty deposits
		for somebody not really working.
		정규 직업이 없는 분 치고
		꽤나 두툼한 금액인데요
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	Where'd the money come from?
		그 돈이 어디서 났죠?
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	Uh,her jewelry business.
		집사람 보석 사업이요
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	I thought you said it
		was a small side business.
		소규모 사업이라고
		하신 걸로 기억하는데요
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	Well,it was, but recently her pieces
		were getting a lot of interest,
		네 맞아요, 그런데 집사람의
		최근 보석들이 큰 수익을 내길래
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:41	And apparently,uh, she made a
		deal with a couple of boutiques.
		알고봤더니 몇몇 부티크에
		납품 거래를 했더라고요
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	Do you know which ones?
		어떤 부티크인지 아십니까?
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	I never asked.
		물어본 적이 없습니다
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	Without her money,you would
		have fallen behind months ago.
		그 돈 없이는 이미 몇 달 전에
		적자가 나셨을 텐데요
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	I know all too well it was my wife
		who had to save our butts recently.
		최근들어 저희 뒷감당을 한 게
		아내 쪽이란 건 저도 잘 압니다
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	- Dad?
		- What's the matter?
		- 아빠?
		- 무슨 일이니?
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	You made it wrong.
		이렇게 만드는 거 아녜요
00:20:59

		열쇠는 그 여자가 죽은 후에 가져간 거고
		금고를 연건 순전한 호기심에서였어요
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	You taped together your whole theory with a couple
		of random conversations I've had with a drug dealer.
		제가 마약상하고 한 대사 몇 마디 갖고
		이 전체 사건을 짜집기한 거 아녜요
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:55	Does that about sum it up?
		안그렇던가요?
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	Well,when she puts it like
		that,it does seem pretty thin.
		저런 식으로 말하니까
		정말 빈약해보이긴 하네
00:28:59	 
		 
00:28:59	Yeah. She's a piece of work, isn't she?
		그래? 저 여자
		정말 물건이지?
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:03	We're gonna have to cut her loose for now,but I
		think some discreet surveillance might help our cause.
		지금은 저 여자를 풀어줘야겠지만
		감시를 붙이면 도움이 될지도 몰라
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:12	If you were thinking of trying
		that on,don't. Not your shade.
		그거 바를 생각이면 참아
		네 피부톤에는 안 받아
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	What do you think about older women?
		나이든 여인은 어때요?
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:18	Where is this coming from? I don't think
		about older women. My mother's an older woman.
		그건 또 왜? 난 나이든 여인은
		생각 안해, 우리 엄마가 나이든 여인인걸
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:21	Not old old, just older,you
		know? Older than you.
		그렇게 나이든 게 아니라요
		그냥 본인보다 연상인 여자요
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	Why you asking?
		왜 물어봐?
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	You're not trying to set
		me up with somebody,are you?
		나 소개팅 시켜주려고 그러냐?
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	It turns out--if you look at the available
		scientific evidence on the internet--
		인터넷에 과학적인
		증거를 보니까요..
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:32	And they've got less hang-ups, they like
		themselves way more than younger women,
		연상이 튕기는 것도 적고요
		젊은 여자들보다 자기애도 크고요
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	And they're at their sexual peak.
		성적으로 최고점에
		도달해있대요
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	I mean,that's what the
		research says anyhow.
		어쨌든 연구 결과에는
		그렇게 나와있더라고요
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:40	What the hell happened to
		you at that country club?
		너 그 컨츄리 클럽에서
		대체 무슨 일을 당한 거냐?
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:44	Nothing. I'm just saying
		that-- Oh,no. She spotted us.
		아니에요, 전 그냥..
		앗, 우리를 봤네요
00:29:47	 
		 
00:29:51	Afternoon,boys.
		좋은 오후죠
		오빠들
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	I was making myself a pani and
		thought i'd bring you some,too.
		이탈리아식 샌드위치를 만드는데
		형사님들 생각이 나더라고요
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	Thanks,ma'am.
		감사합니다, 부인
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	Oh,and just so you know, I am
		headed to the club for a massage,
		아 그리고 말이죠
		지금 마사지 받으러 갈 건데
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	So you don't need to follow too close.
		너무 바짝 따라오진 마세요
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	Relax. Have a bite to eat
		first. I'll see you there.
		편히 쉬면서 우선 한 입 드세요
		그럼 거기서 뵈요
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	Yes,ma'am.
		네, 부인
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:11	"yes,ma'am,thank you,ma'am."
		What is wrong with you?
		"네 부인, 감사합니다 부인"
		너 정신나갔냐?
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	Well,she surprised me.
		그럼 어떡해요
		갑자기 놀래키는데
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	What's in the sandwiches?
		샌드위치 안에
		뭐 들었어?
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	Well,it's a pani, if you don't mind.
		엄밀히 말하면
		이탈리아식 샌드위치에요
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	- It's,uh,ham and cheese.
		- Yeah,who knows what else?
		- 햄하고 치즈에요
		- 그 밖에 또 뭘 넣었을지 알아?
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:27	******
		세상에
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:31	Drugs? I can't believe it.
		약물이라고요?
		믿겨지지가 않네요
00:30:35	 
		 
00:30:36	Using jewelry sales as a cover, your wife was
		dealing prescription drugs-- painkillers mostly.
		부인은 보석 판매로 위장하면서
		처방 의약품을 밀매했습니다
00:30:39	Using jewelry sales as a cover, your wife was
		dealing prescription drugs-- painkillers mostly.
		주로 진통제나
		각정제, 다이어트 약이었죠
00:30:40	Using jewelry sales as a cover, your wife was
		dealing prescription drugs-- painkillers mostly.
		 
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	Speed,diet pills.
		 
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	Some of them were coming in from mexico,
		other ones were stolen from pharmacies.
		일부는 멕시코에서 들여왔고
		일부는 약국에서 훔친 거였습니다
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:49	You seem genuinely surprised.
		정말 놀란 것 처럼
		보이시는데요
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	A lot of people around
		here knew about her.
		이 동네 사람들
		상당수가 알고 있었습니다
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	I had no idea.
		저는 전혀 몰랐습니다
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:56	You don't think I had
		something to do with this?
		설마 제가 이 일과 관련 있다고
		생각하시는 건 아니겠죠?
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	She was moving an
		awful lot of inventory.
		실어나르는 재고량이
		상당했던데요
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	I had nothing to do with this.
		저는 이 일과
		아무 상관 없었소
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	How could you have not known she was
		medicating half the women in the neighborhood?
		부인이 이 동네 여자들 절반을
		약 먹이는 걸 어떻게 모르셨어요?
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:07	She lied to me.
		나한테 거짓말을
		했으니까요
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:13	Maybe she was just trying
		to protect me from the shame.
		아내는 제 명예를 지켜주려고
		비밀로 했던 건지도 몰라요
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	Or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind
		eye, as long as the money was coming in.
		아니면 못본 체 하는 게
		더 쉬웠던 건지 모르죠
00:31:18	Or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind
		eye, as long as the money was coming in.
		현금이 계속
		들어오는 한 말예요
00:31:18	Or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind
		eye, as long as the money was coming in.
		 
00:31:20	Or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind
		eye, as long as the money was coming in.
		 
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:20	No. If I had known she was doing
		this, I would have tried to stop her.
		아닙니다, 만약 제가 알았더라면
		못하게 막았을 겁니다
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:28	I'm patrick.
		난 패트릭이야
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:30	Oscar.
		오스카에요
00:31:31	 
		 
00:31:31	You want to talk,oscar?
		우리 얘기 할래, 오스카?
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:49	Pretty heavy stuff going on, right?
		지금 이것저것
		좀 심각하다, 그치?
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	Yeah.
		네
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:55	I'm sorry about your mom.
		너희 엄마
		일은 유감이야
00:31:57	 
		 
00:31:57	Me,too.
		저도 그래요
00:31:59	 
		 
00:31:59	My dad is sad because you
		guys can't find who did it.
		우리 아빠는 아저씨들이
		범인을 못찾아서 슬퍼해요
00:32:03	 
		 
00:32:03	But I don't mind about that.
		하지만 전 그런 건
		괜찮아요
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	I just want her back.
		그냥 엄마가
		다시 왔으면 좋겠어요
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:10	She can't come back.
		You know that,don't you?
		엄마는 다시 못와
		너도 그건 알지?
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:13	I know that. I'm 9.
		알아요
		저도 9살이라고요
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:17	I will never see her
		again until I'm dead,too.
		제가 죽기 전까지는
		엄마를 다시 못보겠죠
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:21	Then i'll go stay with her in heaven.
		그리고 나서 천국에서
		엄마와 같이 살 거에요
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	Well,that sounds good.
		그거 괜찮은 것 같은데
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:26	But you know what I noticed you're really
		good at that could help you right now?
		근데 내가 보기에 너한테 지금
		도움이 될 만한 재능이 있거든?
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:30	What?
		뭔데요?
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	Make-believe.
		가장하는 거 말이야
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:35	Yeah. I am.
		맞아요
		저 그거 잘해요
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	You are very good at it.
		그래, 너 정말 잘하더라
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:40	A master like you, you
		wanted to talk to your mom,
		너 같은 고수면
		엄마랑 얘기하고 싶을 떄
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	You could make-believe she was here and
		do whatever you like. I do it all the time.
		엄마가 여기있다고 가장하고
		뭐든 하는 거야, 난 항상 그러는걸
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:45	- You talk to my mom?
		- No,not your mom. I talk to my wife.
		- 우리 엄마한테 말한다고요?
		- 아니, 너희 엄마 말고 내 아내
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	- She's dead?
		- Yeah. Yeah.
		- 죽었어요?
		- 그래, 그래
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	But I talk to her all the time.
		You should try it. It's very good.
		근데 난 맨날 아내한테 말하는 걸
		너도 한 번 해봐, 정말 좋아
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	- I guess.
		- Well,whatever.
		- 봐서요
		- 뭐, 그래
00:32:58	 
		 
00:33:00	This is cool.
		이거 멋진데
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	You any good with this sword?
		너 이 검 잘 다뤄?
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	I'm okay.
		괜찮게 해요
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:07	Oh,really?
		그렇단 말이지?
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:12	I got you!
		내가 이겼다!
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:17	Please. Mercy. Mercy.
		부디 자비를,
		자비를 베푸소서
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:22	Fair maiden. D'artagnan,i
		have to go. Good-bye.
		아리따운 아가씨네, 달따냥
		이제 가봐야겠어, 안녕히
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:34	Ugh, spa stuff takes forever.
		으, 스파니 뭐니
		엄청 오래걸리네요
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	How long can a massage be?
		마사지하는 데
		뭐 이렇게 오래 걸려요?
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	No,they do all sorts of things to you
		besides a massage-- facials,waxing,mud.
		마사지 말고도 별 걸 다하거든
		피부관리, 제모, 머드팩
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	How do you know so much?
		어떻게 그렇게 잘 알아요?
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	I bought a certificate for my mom.
		우리 엄마 이용권
		선물해드렸으니까
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:47	Wayne. You're back again. How nice.
		웨인, 다시 왔군요
		반가워요
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:51	Hi,mrs. Shaper.
		안녕하세요
		쉐이퍼 부인
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	Now you know, you must call me jackie.
		명심하세요
		"재키"라고 불러줘요
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:55	And it's "ms.," not "mrs." divorced.
		그리고 "부인"이 아니에요
		이혼했죠
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:58	Sorry... Jackie.
		미안해요...재키
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	He was a good man, but
		weak,essentially.He just couldn't see--
		그이는 착한 사람이었는데
		근본이 나약했죠, 도무지..
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	wait. What are you wearing on your lips?
		잠깐, 입술에
		바른 거 뭐에요?
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	- Excuse me? - The color.
		What--what color is this?
		- 뭐라고요? 
		- 그 색 말이에요, 무슨 색이에요?
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:10	Tongue in cheek. You like it?
		"텅 인 치크"요
		맘에 들어요?
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:12	Where did you get it?
		그거 어디서 났어요?
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:14	I bought it at the boutique in town.
		시내의 부티크에서 샀죠
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:15	How long have you been
		wearing this shade?
		이 색 바른지
		얼마나 되셨죠?
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	I just bought it today.
		오늘 아침에
		막 산 거에요
00:34:18	 
		 
00:34:18	I saw it on patience
		broadbent at scarlett's party.
		페이션스가 스칼렛 파티에서
		이걸 하고 온 걸 봤죠
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	I just had to have it.
		저도 꼭 사야겠더라고요
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	It's a crazy price, but what the heck?
		정신나간 가격이지만
		아무렴 어때요?
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	You're positive that
		it's tongue in cheek?
		그거 "텅 인 치크"인 게
		확실해요?
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:26	I have it right here.
		지금 여기 있어요
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:27	And you definitely saw patience wearing
		it first at scarlett marquesa's party?
		스칼렛씨의 파티에서 페이션스씨가
		이걸 바른 것도 확실하고요?
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	Is that a pickup line?
		그거 작업용 대사인가요?
00:34:33	 
		 
00:35:01	No detectable prints on the knife.
		칼에 식별 가능한
		지문은 없었습니다
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	Surveillance tapes?
		감시 테잎은?
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	The spa didn't believe in them.
		Something to do with disturbing the chi.
		여기선 그런 거 취급 안한대요
		기의 흐름을 방해한다나요
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:08	I don't get it. Why
		kill patience? Why now?
		이해가 안돼, 왜 페이션스를
		죽인 거지? 왜 지금이야?
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:10	Perhaps it was part
		of the plan all along.
		처음부터 그게
		계획이었을지도 모르죠
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	No,this was hasty. Patience
		became the new target.
		아니, 이건 급하게 저지른 거야
		페이션스를 갓 희생자로 정한 거야
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	Revenge for scarlett's death?
		스칼렛의 죽음에
		대한 복수일까?
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	Victor was quick to anger.
		빅터는 금세
		화내는 성격이었잖아
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	Rigsby,find out victor
		marquesa's recent whereabouts.
		릭스비, 빅터 마퀘이사의
		최근 알리바이를 알아봐
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	Yes,boss.
		네, 대장님
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	It could have been someone else.
		다른 사람이었을 수도 있어
00:35:25	 
		다른 사람이었을 수도 있어
00:35:25	The competition wiping out the
		dealer and her heir apparent or...
		다른 사람이었을 수도 있어
00:35:26	The competition wiping out the
		dealer and her heir apparent or...
		 
00:35:26	The competition wiping out the
		dealer and her heir apparent or...
		마약상과 그 후임자까지
		해치워버린 경쟁자 짓이거나..
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:30	Or what?
		그거나 뭐?
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	Victor does fit nicely, doesn't he?
		빅터가 참 그럴싸해
		보이긴 하다, 그치?
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:36	Yeah.
		그래
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:44	Can you believe that
		patience got stabbed?
		페이션스가 찔렸다니
		믿겨져?
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	It's like a mafia hit.
		무슨 마피아식 처형같아
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	I'm never going in that spa
		again,i will tell you that.
		어쨌건 난 다시는
		저 스파에 안 갈거야
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:51	Tragic set of events.
		잇달아 참극이
		발생했네요
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:53	I didn't see it coming.
		이럴 줄은
		상상도 못했죠
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	So what do you think? This
		is some kind of drug war?
		어떤 것 같으세요?
		무슨 마약 다툼인가요?
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	Could be,but stabbings are
		usually crimes of passion.
		가능하죠, 그런데 칼로 찌르는 건
		보통 치정의 범죄에요
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:02	This is,uh, this is very personal.
		이건 지극히
		개인적인 거죠
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:06	So what's next?
		그럼 이제 어떻게 되죠?
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:07	Cbi are already putting
		the pieces together.
		CBI에서는 단서들을
		꿰어 맞추고 있습니다
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	In fact,uh...
		W--never mind.
		실은 저희가..
		아, 아무것도 아니에요
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:14	What?
		뭔데요?
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:15	No,i-i shouldn't talk about it
		'cause it's still an ongoing case.
		지금 진행중인 수사니까
		더 말 안하는 게 좋겠어요
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	You know,you can't just leave
		something like that hanging.
		에이, 그렇게 말을
		하다 마는 게 어딨어요
00:36:20	 
		에이, 그렇게 말을
		하다 마는 게 어딨어요
00:36:20	Well,i'm sorry,you know, but i
		will get myself in a lot of trouble.
		에이, 그렇게 말을
		하다 마는 게 어딨어요
00:36:20	Well,i'm sorry,you know, but i
		will get myself in a lot of trouble.
		 
00:36:21	Well,i'm sorry,you know, but i
		will get myself in a lot of trouble.
		죄송해요, 그렇치만 제가
		곤란해 진다고요
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:25	Oh,come on,girls.
		봐줘요, 아가씨들
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	All right,listen.
		알았어요
		잘 들어요
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	Can you promise me that this
		will just stay between us?
		절대 비밀로 하겠다고
		약속할 수 있어요?
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	Yes. Yes,of course.
		네, 물론이죠
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	- You promise?
		- I promise.
		- 약속하세요?
		- 약속할게요
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:35	Okay,we're going after victor marquesa.
		좋아요, 저희는 빅터 
		마퀘이사에 주력하고 있어요
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	Victor? Oh,i don't believe it. He
		doesn't even look like the type.
		빅터요? 말도 안되요
		그럴 타입으로도 안보이는데
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	On what grounds?
		무슨 근거로요?
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	We think that he killed patience out
		of revenge for the murder of his wife.
		자기 아내를 죽인 데 분노해서
		빅터가 페이션스를 죽인 것 같습니다
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:45	But you said there was no
		proof patience was guilty.
		하지만 페이션스가
		유죄라는 증거는 없다면서요
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:48	I guess victor didn't want
		to wait around for proof.
		빅터씨는 증거가 나올 때까지
		기다릴 순 없었나봅니다
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	What's gonna happen to oscar?
		그럼 오스카는 어떻게 되지?
00:36:52	 
		 
00:36:52	Mother murdered, now dad's a murder.
		어머니는 살해당하고
		아버지는 이제 살인자니
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	Once they arrest the father,
		he'll be placed in foster care.
		아버지를 체포하면
		위탁 시설에 보내질 겁니다
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:57	Oh,how dreadful.
		세상에, 얼마나 끔찍할까
00:36:59	 
		 
00:36:59	- That poor child.
		- It is.
		- 애가 너무 딱해요
		- 그래요
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:13	I guess they couldn't keep the secret.
		그 아줌마들이
		비밀은 못지켰네
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:15	Guess they can't.
		못 참겠나보네
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:18	Let's do it.
		그럼 해볼까
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:22	- It's gonna be all right,son.
		-Dad!
		- 괜찮다, 얘야
		- 아빠!
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:23	- I promise.
		- No!
		- 약속할게
		- 안돼!
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	- It's gonna be okay.
		- Where are you going?
		- 괜찮을 거야
		- 아빠 어디가?
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	Don't worry! I'll be right back!
		걱정 하지마!
		아빠 금방 올게!
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:28	No! Dad!
		안돼! 아빠!
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	*****
		괜찮다
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:32	Come back! No! No,no,no.
		가지 말아요!
		안돼! 안돼, 안돼
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	Stop,stop,stop. You have to stop this.
		그만, 그만, 그만둬요
		그만 멈추세요
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:40	No. No,we can't. This
		is justice being served.
		그럴 순 없습니다
		정의를 실현하는 중이니까요
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:42	How can you say that? Look what
		you're putting that boy through.
		그런 말씀이 나오세요?
		저 애를 좀 보세요
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	He'll forget eventually. It's fine.
		결국에는 잊을 겁니다
		괜찮아요
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	- No. No,he won't. No. No,it's not.
		- It's fine.Why?
		- 아뇨, 못 잊어요, 아니, 안 괜찮아요
		- 괜찮아요, 왜요?
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	Because i did it! I killed them.
		제가 그랬으니까요!
		제가 죽였어요
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:53	I killed them both. Oh,god.
		둘 다 제가 죽였어요
		세상에
00:37:57	 
		 
00:38:09	I first suspected it was you because it seemed that
		everybody else at the club wore some of scarlett's jewelry,
		당신을 처음 의심한 건
		모두 스칼렛의 보석을 착용했는데
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	But not you.
		당신만 예외여서였어요
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:17	That's it? Jewelry?
		그게 다에요? 보석 때문에?
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:20	The more we talked, the more
		i felt your pain and anger.
		당신과 이야기를 나눌 수록
		당신의 고통과 분노가 전해졌죠
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:26	Losing your daughter has unhinged you.
		따님을 잃은 게 당신을
		흔들어 놓은 것 같아요
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	Unhinged?
		흔들어놔요?
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:32	Yeah,i suppose it has.
		네, 그렇겠네요
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:39	My daughter...
		우리 딸..
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:43	Rachel.
		레이첼은요
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:47	She loved to dance.
		춤추는 걸 정말 좋아했어요
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	Didn't matter what kind of music
		either, a toe would start tapping and...
		음악 종류에 상관없이
		발가락을 두드리기 시작했죠..
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:54	She was just so full of life.
		정말이지 생기가
		넘치는 아이였어요
00:38:57	 
		 
00:39:00	She had taken several inkillers with
		alcohol before she got behind the wheel.
		운전대를 잡기 전에
		진통제와 술을 섞어 마셨어요
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	One of her neighborhood friends got them
		from her mother who got them from scarlett.
		이웃집 친구 한명이 엄마한테 얻고
		그 엄마는 스칼렛한테 얻은 거에요
00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:11	I understand your anger.
		당신의 분노를
		이해합니다
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:13	It was like they ripped
		my soul out clean.
		누군가 와서 제 영혼을
		말끔히 뜯어간 것 같았어요
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:17	But the rest of the world
		just kept moving right along.
		그런데 세상은 아무일
		없다는 듯 돌아갔죠
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	It was like i was the only one
		who remembered what happened.
		마치 그 일을 기억하는 사람이
		이제 저 밖에 안남은 것 처럼요
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:26	So when i...Saw her flitting about town,
		그런데 그 여자는
		여전히 동네에서 활개를 치고
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	selling her pills without
		a care in the world,
		전혀 아랑곳 않고
		여전히 약을 파는 거에요
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:34	Still hosting parties at her house,
		여전히 파티나 열면서요
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	happily dancing around without a stitch
		of the misery i was carrying,i snapped.
		제가 떠안은 고통은 티끌만큼도
		모른채, 춤추는 꼴을 보고
00:39:40	happily dancing around without a stitch
		of the misery i was carrying,i snapped.
		 
00:39:40	happily dancing around without a stitch
		of the misery i was carrying,i snapped.
		마침내 전 폭발했어요
00:39:42	 
		마침내 전 폭발했어요
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:45	I killed her.
		그 여자를 죽였습니다
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:55	I didn't want any other person
		to have to experience what i did.
		누가 또 저같은 경험을
		겪게 하고 싶진 않았어요
00:39:59	 
		 
00:40:16	And patience?
		그리고 페이션스는요?
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:18	She told everyone at
		the club not to worry.
		그 클럽 사람들에게
		걱정하지 말라더군요
00:40:21	 
		 
00:40:21	She was gonna take over scarlett's
		business and keep the pills coming,
		자기가 스칼렛의 사업을 이어받아
		계속 약을 대주겠다고요
00:40:25	 
		 
00:40:26	Like nothing had happened, like
		no lessons had been learned.
		마치 아무 일 없다는 듯이,
		아무것도 배운 게 없다는 듯이요
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:32	I had to finish what i started.
		제가 시작한 일이니
		제가 끝내야 했어요
00:40:35	 
		 
00:40:36	I had to.
		그래야 했어요
00:40:38	 
		 
00:40:42	I'll get this transcribed
		for you to sign.
		서명하실 수 있게
		녹취록으로 옮겨올게요
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:52	Now that it's done, does it feel better?
		막상 다 끝내면
		기분이 나아지나요?
00:40:55	 
		 
00:40:59	It doesn't change a thing.
		변한 건 아무것도 없는걸요
00:41:01	 
		 
00:41:12	Agent lisbon.
		리스본 요원님
00:41:13	 
		 
00:41:13	Mr.marquesa,hi.
		마퀘이사씨
		안녕하세요
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:15	I want to thank you and your team.
		요원님과 팀원 분들께
		감사인사를 드리고 싶어요
00:41:18	 
		 
00:41:18	Although,i must admit, that whole
		scene in front of the house--
		그래도 제가 보기에
		집 앞에서 벌인 그 광경은..
00:41:20	 
		 
00:41:21	It was make-believe,dad.
		아빠 그건
		가장이라니까요
00:41:22	 
		 
00:41:22	Sorry. The make-believe was a
		bit unorthodox and unpleasant,
		미안, 이런 가장은 다소
		경우에 없고 불쾌한 듯 하지만..
00:41:28	 
		 
00:41:28	But i'm sure you all
		know what you're doing.
		물론 여러분들 일이니
		잘 알아서 하신 거겠죠
00:41:30	 
		 
00:41:30	Most of the time.
		거의 그런 편이죠
00:41:32	 
		 
00:41:32	I want to apologize if
		we were tough on you.
		저희가 다소 거칠게
		나간 점 죄송합니다
00:41:35	 
		 
00:41:35	No,it's what i needed to hear.
		아뇨, 저한테는
		그런 말이 필요했습니다
00:41:38	 
		 
00:41:38	We're moving out of villa marsante
		and headed back to my hometown.
		저희는 빌라 마르상테 단지를 떠나
		제 고향으로 이사가요
00:41:43	 
		 
00:41:43	My son and i have a lot
		of catching up to do.
		아들에게 그 동안 못해준 걸
		많이 따라잡아야 하거든요
00:41:46	 
		 
00:41:49	- Take care.
		- Thanks.
		- 잘 지내세요
		- 고맙습니다
00:41:52	 
		 
00:41:54	Mr.jane.
		제인 씨
00:41:55	 
		 
00:41:57	Thank you.
		감사합니다
00:41:58	 
		 
00:41:58	Oh,it's nothing. Forget about it.
		아무것도 아녀요
		괜찮습니다
00:42:01	 
		 
00:42:01	Take care. Good luck. Bye.
		잘 지내시고요
		안녕히 가세요
00:42:05	 
		 
00:42:07	Another minute, and i
		would have missed 'em.
		조금만 늦었어도
		못 보고 갔을텐데
00:42:09	 
		 
00:42:09	- I do hate it when people say thank you.
		- Why?
		- 사람들이 고맙다고 하면 싫더라
		- 왜요?
00:42:11	 
		 
00:42:11	He likes to play the lone ranger.
		자기는 고독한 방랑자
		역할이 좋은 거거든
00:42:13	 
		 
00:42:13	"who was that masked man? I
		never got a chance to thank him."
		"그 가면 쓴 남자는 누구지?
		미처 고맙다는 말도 하지 못했어"
00:42:17	 
		 
00:42:19	Exactly.
		바로 그거야
00:42:21	 
		 
00:42:23	Uh,i don't want to alarm you, but your
		friend jackie has just walked in behind you,
		놀래키려는 건 아닌데, 방금
		자네 친구 재키가 들어왔어
00:42:29	 
		 
00:42:29	And she is looking fierce.
		끝내주는 차림을
		하고 말이야
00:42:31	 
		 
00:42:31	Oh,i know. I asked her out to dinner.
		아, 저도 알아요
		저녁 데이트를 신청했거든요
