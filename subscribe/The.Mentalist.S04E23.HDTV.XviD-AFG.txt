00:00:12	Lovely.
		참 산뜻하네 
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	Yeah. Used to be
		a fluorescent lightbulb factory.
		형광등 만들던 공장이었대요
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	Now it's
		a hazardous waste site.
		이제는 위험물 적치장이죠
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	There's Mercury dust
		everywhere.
		수은 섞인 먼지가 도처에 날아다녀요
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	Great.
		최고네
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Yeah, it's probably
		not too dangerous,
		아주 유독하고 이러진 않을 거예요 
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	as long as you don't,
		you know, breathe.
		숨만 오래 참을 수 있다면야 
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:27	Some techs from the state
		toxic substances bureau
		독성물질 관련부서 기술자들이 와서
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	came in to test the air.
		성분분석 위해 공기 채취 중입니다 
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	Saw a lock
		on one of the lockers,
		락커 중에 잠긴게 있어서 
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	busted it open.
		뜯어냈습니다 
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	That's when they found it.
		안에서 이게 나왔죠 
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:37	How long does the coroner think
		he's been in there?
		검시관 보기엔 얼마나 오래 있었던 거래? 
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	He said with that level
		of decomp,
		부패 정도로 봐서 
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	at least six months.
		Could be longer.
		최소 6개월 아니면 그 이상이랍니다 
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	Handcuffs on the wrists,
		ankles.
		손목과 발목을 수갑으로 결박했군
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:43	Did he have any clothes
		or personal effects?
		옷가지나 개인 소지품은?
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	Found this.
		이걸 찾았습니다 
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:46	We found it
		inside his ribcage.
		흉곽 안쪽에 들어 있더군요 
00:00:48	 
		 
00:00:48	Probably something medical.
		의료 관련된 뭔가겠지 
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	Have the coroner's assistant
		look at it.
		검시관 보조한테 줘서 보게 해 
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:53	Scratches on the doors.
		문짝에 긁힌 자국이 있네 
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	Must be from his cuffs.
		수갑으로 긁은 자국이겠지 
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	He was alive
		when he was put inside.
		여기 산채로 갇힌거야 
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	How long would it take to die
		in here? Like, five, six days?
		이런데서 죽는데 얼마나 걸리죠? 
		닷새, 엿새 정도 걸리나?
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:01	That's the right place for it.
		No one in earshot.
		들을 사람 하나 없는 곳이니 
		살 가망이 없었겠군
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	Make sure the techs search
		every inch of this floor
		감식반한테 여기랑 위층이랑
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	and the one above.
		이잡듯 뒤지라고 해 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:12	What's up? Where are you?
		뭐해? 지금 어디야? 
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	Yeah. Sorry, Lisbon.
		I had my phone turned off.
		미안해, 리스본. 전화를 꺼뒀어 
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:16	We're in the middle
		of a toxic waste dump. Hurry up.
		우린 지금 독성 쓰레기장에 처박혀 있어,
		서둘러 와 
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	Ooh. That sounds inviting.
		그거 굉장히 솔깃한 말인데 
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:21	I'll see you there.
		곧 만나 
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	Chop chop.
		Time's a-wastin'.
		빨랑빨랑 움직여, 시간이 금이야 
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:51	 
		 
00:02:27	 
		 
00:02:42	Hello, Patrick.
		안녕, 패트릭
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:47	Hello.
		안녕
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	What's your name?

00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:52	Hailey.
		헤일리
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54	Well, it's nice to meet you,
		Hailey.
		만나서 반갑구나, 헤일리
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:58	How'd you know
		my name was Patrick?
		내가 패트릭이라는 걸 어떻게 알았니? 
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	Your friend told me.
		친구가 말해줬어 
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:05	Which friend's that?
		어떤 친구? 
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	The one who brought me here.
		날 여기 데려다 준 친구 
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	He gave me this.
		나한테 이것도 줬어 
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:16	He didn't do anything else,
		did he?
		너한테 다른 일은 안 한거지? 
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	He told me to ask you
		a question.
		그리고 뭐 하나 물어보랬어 
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	What's that?
		뭔데?
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:23	He said to ask you...
		뭐라고 했냐면...
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	Do you give up yet?
		아직도 포기 못했냐고

		레드존 혹은 그를 사칭한 사람이 
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	lured the girl away from

		한시간 전 인근 공원에서 여자아이를
		꾀여내 여기 데려온 듯 하네 
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	Her class was on a field trip.
		학교 소풍 나온 아이였어 
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:56	It doesn't look like she was

		다친 곳은 없어 보이고, 어머니에게 
		연락이 갔네 
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	Where's Jane?
		제인은요?
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	Over there.
		He hasn't said much.
		저기 있어, 통 말이 없군 
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:04	Gonna run this note
		they left for Jane,
		제인 보라고 쪽지를 남겼던 모양이야 
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	check it for prints and D.N.A.
		가서 지문이나 DNA 분석을 해보게 
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	You won't get any.
		보나마나 허탕일 겁니다 
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:08	I know. It's worth a shot.
		알지만 시도는 해 봐야지 
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:09	"Happy Anniversary."

00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	Yeah.
		 
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:16	Would you excuse me, sir?
		잠시 둘만 얘기해도 될까요?
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:17	Yeah.

00:04:28	Hi, Hailey.

00:04:29	I like your hair.

00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	Thank you.
		고맙다 
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:32	Patrick is teaching me
		how to make a quarter disappear.
		패트릭이 동전 마술을 가르쳐 줬어요 
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	The kid's a natural.

00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	No doubt.

00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Hailey, hello.
		My name's Agent Wainright.
		안녕, 헤일리. 난 웨인라이트 요원이란다 
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:42	Your mom's gonna be here soon.
		어머니가 곧 도착하실거야 
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	When she gets here,
		어머니 오시거든 
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	we're gonna talk to you
		about the man you met.
		네가 본 아저씨 얘기를 같이 하자꾸나
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Is that all right?
		그래도 괜찮겠지?
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:47	What man?
		어떤 아저씨요?
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	The one who sent you
		to Mr. Jane,
		널 제인 아저씨한테 보낸 아저씨 
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	who drew the face on your hand.
		네 손바닥에 그림을 그려준 아저씨 말이다 
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	I don't know
		what you're talking about.
		무슨 말씀이신지 모르겠는데요 
00:04:59	 
		 
00:05:00	Hailey, why don't you go
		헤일리, 저기 가서 경찰 아줌마한테 
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	and show that policewoman
		your new trick?
		동전 마술을 보여주지 그러니?
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Okay.
		네 
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	Have fun.
		재밌게 놀아라 
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:09	Um, I... I don't understand.
		이게 어떻게 된 건가..? 
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	She doesn't remember?
		기억을 못한단 말인가?
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:13	You hypnotized her.
		애한테 최면을 걸었구나 
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:15	No, I just planted a suggestion
		for her to forget Red John.
		레드존을 잊어보겠냐는 제안을
		심어준 것 뿐이야 
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	Why would you do that?
		왜 그랬나? 
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	She could identify him.
		용의자를 식별할 수 있을텐데 
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	He's white.
		He wore a baseball cap.
		백인이고 야구모자를 썼고 
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	He had an odd voice.
		이상한 목소리를 냈답니다 
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	All right, look,
		이봐 
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:27	she might remember more
		if she were questioned properly.
		제대로 된 심문을 하면 더 많은걸
		기억해 낼지도 모른단 말일세 
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	Jane. Jane, she's a witness.
		제인, 저 아인 엄연한 증인이야 
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	People who can identify Red John
		end up dead.
		레드존을 알아보는 사람은 
		누구든 반드시 살해당합니다 
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	I get that you feel protective
		here.
		우리가 보호해 줄 수 있어 
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	Do you?
		그러세요?
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	- This is not your call.
		- Yes, it is.
		- 자네가 결정할 사안이 아니야 
		- 사안이고말고요 
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	If you try to question her
		or even talk to her,
		아이를 심문하려 들거나 가서 
		말이라도 거는 날엔 
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	I will hurt you badly.
		내가 국장님 가만 안 둘 겁니다 
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:46	Did he really
		just threaten me?
		지금 저 친구 날 협박한거야? 
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	Jane, I know it's hard coming
		here, especially like this,
		제인, 지금 힘들다는 거 알아.
		특히 이런 때엔 더더욱 그렇겠지 
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	and I'm sorry.
		그리고 나도 마음이 아파 
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:55	I'm not gonna ask you
		to apologize to Wainright,
		웨인라이트한테 사과하라곤 안할게 
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	but he's right.
		The little girl's a witness.
		하지만 저 말은 맞아, 아이는 증인이야 
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	We should interview her.
		우린 아이를 심문해야 맞아 
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	You know what Red John's
		trying to do, don't you?
		레드존의 의도를 알잖아? 
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	He asked me
		if I'm ready to quit.
		이 짓 그만둘 준비가 됐냐고 묻던데 
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	He's messing with your head.
		네 머리를 어지럽혀 놓으려는 거야 
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	Don't let him.
		그럴 여지도 주지 마 
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	You okay?
		괜찮은거야?
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	Yeah, I'm fine.
		물론, 괜찮아 
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	Appreciate your concern.
		Your phone is ringing.
		신경써줘서 고맙다. 전화 오는데 받아라 
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:20	Hey, Rigsby.
		릭스비 
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	So that thing that we found was
		a surgical heart valve
		흉곽 안에서 나온 건 피해자가 이식받은 
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	implanted in the victim.
		심장 밸브라네요 
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	Traced the serial number on it
		to a guy named Antonio Castro.
		시리얼 넘버로 추적해보니 
		안토니오 카스트로라는 사람입니다 
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	According to S.F.P.D.,
		he disappeared 11 months ago.
		샌프란시스코 경찰 말론
		11개월전 실종됐답니다 
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	Disappeared how?
		어쩌다 실종돼?
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	He sent some e-mails from his
		home on the night of June 17th.
		6월 17일에 집에서 이메일을 발신하곤
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	The next morning,
		he was gone.
		다음날 아침 종적을 감췄답니다 
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	Car parked in the driveway.
		Front door was locked.
		차도 주차되어 있고 현관문도 잠긴 상태에서요 
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	No sign of forced entry
		or struggle.
		강제로 진입하려 들거나 몸싸움한
		흔적은 없었구요 
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	His fiancee filed a missing
		persons report that afternoon.
		약혼녀가 그날 오후 실종 신고를 했습니다 
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	S.F.P.D. find anything?
		샌프란시스코 경찰이 그래서 뭘 찾았어? 
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:45	No. No contact with the family.
		They're out of state.
		가족이 해외에 있어 연락이 안됐구요 
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:47	No travel plans,
		사전 여행 계획도 없었고 
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	no enemies,
		no money troubles.
		적대 관계도 금전 문제도 없었답니다 
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	What'd he do for a living?
		직업은 뭐였는데? 
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	He's former military.
		Two tours in Iraq.
		전직 군인으로 이라크에 두번 다녀왔구요 
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	The past five years,
		he's been working as a broker
		최근 5년간엔 R.F Victor라는 금융회사에서 
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	in a financial company,
		R.F. Victor.
		브로커 일을 했습니다 
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	Van Pelt, bring in
		all the S.F.P.D. files
		반펠트, 샌프란시스코에 연락해 
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	and any physical evidence.
		사건 파일이랑 물증 일체 요청해 
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	Cho, Rigsby,
		I want you to put together
		조랑 릭스비는 사건 타임라인 구성하고
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	a time line and a list
		of all the contacts
		피해자가 사라지기 전
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	the victim had
		before he disappeared.
		가졌던 모든 연락 내역 복구해놔 
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	We need to interview everybody.
		관련자 모두 심문해야겠어 
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	Jane and I will go talk
		to the people he worked with.
		난 제인하고 그 금융회사에 가볼테니 
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:10	Jane.
		제인
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	Anything to offer?
		덧붙일 말 있어? 
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	Uh, well, there's not a lot
		to go off, is there?
		중요한 얘기는 별로 나온 것 같지 않은데 
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	Your point being...
		그래서 네 견해라든지... 
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	No point.
		없어 
00:07:21

		일어날까? 
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:27	Jane seem off to you?
		제인씨 정신을 딴데 파는 거 같지 않아요?
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	Always.
		늘 그렇지 
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:42	Oh. Dennis Victor.
		데니스 빅터입니다 
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	Uh, you're from, uh, CBI?
		CBI에서 오신거죠? 
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	Hi. I'm Agent Lisbon,
		and this is Patrick Jane.
		저는 리스본 요원이고 
		이쪽은 패트릭 제인입니다 
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	You're absolutely positive
		that you found Antonio's body?
		안토니오의 시신이 맞다고 
		확신하십니까?
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	Yes, sir. It was confirmed.
		네. 확인이 끝났습니다 
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	Well, we all knew
		this day could come.
		이런 날이 올 수도 있겠다고 생각했죠 
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	Still, a shock.
		하지만 역시 충격이군요 
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	He was engaged to my niece.
		제 조카랑 약혼한 사이였습니다 
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	I feel it very personally.
		This way.
		개인적으로도 마음이 아프네요,
		이쪽으로 오시죠 
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	What exactly do you
		do here, Mr. Victor?
		여기서 하시는 일이 정확히 뭐죠?
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	We're a financial derivatives
		broker.
		저희는 파생상품 브로커입니다 
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	We offer
		exchange-traded derivatives,
		외환 거래 파생상품이나 옵션, 선물
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	options, futures,
		그리고 장외거래 상품 약간을 
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	and a few over-the-counter
		products.
		취급하고 있습니다 
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	So basically,
		you're just thieves
		간단히 말해 넥타이와 멜빵을 멘
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	in, uh, ties and suspenders.
		도둑놈들이란 말씀이시군요 
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	That would be
		the popular view.
		그게 대중적인 견해죠 
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	Not entirely accurate.
		완전히 정확하다곤 볼 수 없지만요 
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	Up this way.
		올라오시죠 
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:31	Agent Lisbon,
		이쪽은 리스본 요원
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	Mr. Jane,
		제인씨 
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	Ian Breitler.
		이안 브라이틀러입니다 
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	He recruited Antonio to the firm
		안토니오를 채용하고 
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	and he mentored him
		during his first year.
		첫 일년간 사수 역할을 해 줬죠 
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	It's great to meet you.
		만나서 반갑습니다 
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	And this is Ben Marx. He runs
		the division Antonio was in.
		이쪽은 벤 막스, 안토니오가 속했던 
		부서의 부서장입니다 
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	He was his supervisor.
		직속 상관이었죠 
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	Welcome.
		어서 오십시오 
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	Sit. Please, sit.
		앉으세요 
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	Mr. Jane.
		제인씨도 앉으시죠 
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
		감사합니다만 괜찮습니다 
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	What did Antonio Castro
		do for you here?
		안토니오 카스트로씨가 하던 일은
		뭐였죠? 
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	He--he was a broker.
		Handled customer accounts.
		브로커였고 고객 계좌를 관리했습니다 
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	How'd he get along
		with people?
		직장 사람들과 관계는 어땠나요? 
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	Oh, he was universally loved,
		누구에게나 사랑받았고 
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	a leader in the company.
		회사의 젊은 리더였습니다 
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	Absolutely.
		물론이죠 
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	You don't agree?
		그쪽은 동의하지 않으시나 보죠? 
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	Well, who's universally loved?
		누구에게나 사랑받는 사람이 어딨겠습니까?
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	He was popular.
		인기있는 사람이었습니다 
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	Do you know anything
		about his family?
		가족에 관해서는 아시나요? 
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	His mother's in a nursing home
		in flagstaff. Alzheimer's.
		어머니는 알츠하이머로 요양권에 계시고 
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	And his sister converted to
		islam and moved to Indonesia.
		여동생은 무슬림으로 개종해
		말레이시아로 건너갔다 하더군요 
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	They weren't in touch.
		연락하지 않는 사이였습니다 
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	And did he have
		any problems at work?
		직장에서 문제는 없었나요?
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:23	Not that I was aware of.
		제가 아는 한엔 없었습니다 
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	No. All of his performance
		reviews were exemplary.
		업무 성과 보고서는 극히 모범적이었습니다 
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	Isn't that right, Ben?
		그렇지 않나 벤? 
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	If there were any issues,
		무슨 문제가 있었더라도 
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	I wasn't aware of them
		at the time.
		당시엔 아는 바 없었습니다 
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	Mm. Interesting.
		재밌군요 
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	Excuse me?
		뭐라구요? 
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	Well, he's telling the truth,
		but you two aren't.
		저 분은 사실대로 말씀하시지만
		두 분은 그렇지 않군요 
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	Something going on with Castro,
		what was the big secret?
		카스트로한테 뭔가 있었어요, 
		숨기려는게 뭡니까? 
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:42	There wasn't one,
		I assure you.
		맹세컨대 그런건 없어요
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	Yes, there was.
		있는 것 같은데 
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	No, I'm afraid
		you're mistaken.
		그렇다면 잘못 보신 겁니다 
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	No, I'm--I'm sure,
		just as I'm sure
		아뇨, 내 착각이 아니에요
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	you're not very fond
		of Mr. Breitler here.
		당신이 브라이틀러를 싫어한다는 사실 만큼이나
		뚜렷한 사실이죠 
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	I'm Marx. He's Breitler.
		전 막스고 이쪽이 브라이틀러입니다 
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Yes, well,
		whatever your name is,
		아 네, 이름이야 뭘 쓰시건 
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	your boss doesn't like you
		very much,
		당신 상관은 당신을 별로 좋아하지 않습니다 
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	and I wouldn't be surprised
		if he canned you very soon.
		당신이 조만간 잘린다 해도
		별로 놀랍지 않을 거예요 
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	That's a very interesting
		observation because, uh,
		그건 참 흥미로운 관찰 결과입니다
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	Ben here was made a principal
		in the firm
		여기 벤은 지난달 제가 부탁해 
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	last month
		at my express request.
		회사에 본인 돈으로 투자까지 했거든요 
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:10	Okay.
		그렇군요 
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	What's going on, Jane?
		왜 그래, 제인?
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	Nothing.
		아무것도 
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	Oh, I may be a little out of
		sorts, but it's nothing serious.
		몸상태가 저조하긴 하지만
		대단한 건 아니야 
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	Wanna get something to eat?
		뭐라도 먹으러 갈래? 
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	No, I think I might take
		the rest of the day.
		아니, 반차내야 할까봐 
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	You sure?
		정말이야? 
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	Yeah, I'm gonna get a cab.
		I'll see you tomorrow, Lisbon.
		응, 이대로 택시 잡으려고. 
		내일 보자 리스본 
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:34	Hello, Mr. Jane.
		Good to see you again.
		안녕하세요, 제인씨. 
		다시 모시게 되어 기쁩니다 
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	You, too.
		저도 반갑네요 
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	Your table's ready.
		테이블은 준비 됐습니다 
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:43	And your order
		will be right up.
		주문하신 건 곧 나올 겁니다 
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	Thank you.
		고맙습니다 
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:58	There you go.
		주문하신 것 나왔습니다 
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	Thanks.
		감사합니다 
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	 
		 
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:28	 
		 
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:51	Security tells me
		the fire Jane started
		경비 말론 제인이 하마터면 
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	could've burned down
		the building.
		빌딩 전체를 태워먹을 뻔 했다는군
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	I know, sir.
		알겠습니다 
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	I could suspend Jane
		for this,
		이걸로 정직시킬수도 있지만 
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	but I think what happened was
		a cry for help.
		최근 일련의 행동들이 간접적인
		구조 요청이라면 
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	I just need to find out
		what the issue is.
		뭐가 문젠지 알아내야 한다고 생각하네 
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	Me, too, sir.
		제 생각도 그렇습니다 
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	If you don't mind, I think
		I should do the talking.
		괜찮으시다면 제가 얘기를 해 봐야 할 것 같습니다 
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:13	Jane.
		제인
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	Mm.
		 
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:22	What's going on?
		대체 무슨 일이야?
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:25	Well...
		음... 
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:28	I have a little hangover,
		꼭 알아야겠다면 말이지 
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	uh, if you must know.
		지금 숙취가 약간 있어 
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	Why did you burn
		your Red John files?
		왜 레드존 파일을 태웠어? 
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:47	Because he's right.
		그 말이 맞아 
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:51	It's time to give up.
		이젠 그만둘 때도 됐어 
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	Seriously?
		진심인가? 
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:58	What do you mean?
		무슨 뜻이야 그게? 
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	Well, nothing's working.
		다 해봤는데 안됐어 
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:03	Nothing.
		하나도 
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:07	It's just a game,
		and he keeps winning.
		이게 단지 게임이고, 
		그것도 놈이 계속 이기는 게임이라면 
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:15	The only way for me to stop him
		is if I stop playing.
		내편에서 그만두는게 놈을 멈출 수 있는
		유일한 방법이 아닐까 
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	Meaning what?
		뭐라고? 
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:24	Meaning I put it behind me.
		과거에 묻어버리겠다는 거야
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:29	I move on.
		그리고 새출발을 해야지
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:34	That's a big change, Jane.
		그건 엄청난 결단이야, 제인 
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:38	Well, change is good.
		좋은 결단이잖아 
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	Isn't it?
		안 그래? 
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:43	So...
		그러면... 
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Are you leaving the CBI?
		CBI를 떠나겠다는 거야? 
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	No, of course not.
		What would I do for amusement?
		그건 물론 아니지. 
		이거라도 없으면 심심해서 어떻게 살아 
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	Speaking of which,
		isn't there some person
		말이 나와 말인데 
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	or something we should be
		investigating or such?
		우리가 지금 뭐 사람이나 뭔가 사건
		진행해야 할게 하나 있지? 
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	We're supposed to talk
		to the victim's fiancee.
		피해자 약혼녀를 만나려고 해 
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	Okay. Let's go.
		좋아, 가자 
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:57	Jane, I strongly recommend
		제인, 어제 일에 대해 우리쪽 
00:15:59	 
		 
00:15:59	that you talk to one of our
		counselors about what happened.
		상담사를 한번 만나보게, 진지하게 
		하는 말이야 
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:01	I think it could help you.
		자넬 도와줄 수 있을거야 
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	Luther, there's no time.
		루더, 그럴 시간이 없어요 
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	I got perps to break.
		처단해야 할 악당들이 있거든요 
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:09	Hey.
		선배 
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	How's the time line going?
		Anything jump out?
		타임라인 구성 어떻게 되어가요?
		중간에 발견된 거 있어요? 
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	Yeah. Castro did completely
		normal stuff, then disappeared.
		카스트로는 평범하기 그지 없는 
		사람이었고 그냥 사라졌어 
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	He was at a charity event,
		right before he vanished, yeah?
		사라지기 직전에 자선 행사에 
		참여한게 있었죠? 
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	What happened there?
		거기서 무슨 일이 있었을까요? 
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	It was a fund-raiser
		for the homeless.
		홈리스들을 위한 기금 모금 행사였어 
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	Witnesses say Castro was
		calm, relaxed, left alone.
		증인들 말론 카스트로는 조용히 혼자 있었대 
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	Are we gonna catch any
		good breaks in this case?
		그럼 여태까지 실마리가 하나도 없는 거네요 
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	I doubt it.
		두고봐야지 
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:28	What's the package?
		그 상자는 뭐냐? 
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	It's a baby monitor.
		It's got audio and video.
		아기용 cctv요. 영상이랑 소리 지원 다 돼요 
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	Plus, it's 2-way,
		쌍방으로 통신이 가능해서 
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	so I can talk to Ben in his crib
		without leaving my bed.
		침대에 누워서도 요람에 있는
		벤이랑 얘기할 수 있어요 
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	That should terrify him.
		애가 겁먹을걸 
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	Hey.
		So I've been going through
		카스트로 사무실에서 샌프란시스코
		경찰들이 모아들인 
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	the stuff S.F.P.D. collected
		at Castro's office,
		파일을 죄 읽어봤는데 
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	and I found this--"19:24""
		이런게 나왔어요, 19:24라고 
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	it was stuck
		to a folder on his desk.
		서류철에 붙어 있었대요 
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	He was ex-military.
		Could it be military time?
		전직 군인이었으니, 군대에서 쓰는
		시간 아니에요? 
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	No, there wouldn't be a colon
		between the nine and two.
		군대에선 시간 사이에 콜론 안 써 
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	It's something else.
		뭔가 다른거야 
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	Well, if you have any ideas,
		let me know.
		뭔가 떠오르면 말씀 주세요 
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	I'm not finding anything else
		useful.
		다른 눈에 띄는 건 없더라구요 
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	You know that Jane told Lisbon
		he was giving up on Red John?
		제인씨가 반장님한테
		레드존 수사 그만두겠다고 했다며? 
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	Yeah.
		나도 들었어 
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	It's hard to believe.
		믿기지가 않던데 
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	You think he's losing it?
		정신이 살짝 어떻게 된건 아니겠지? 
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	Like cracking up?
		이를테면 더는 견디지 못해서? 
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	No.
		아냐 
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	Nah.
		Nah.
		설마 
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:16	Thank you for talking to us,
		Ms. Victor.
		만나주셔서 감사합니다 빅터 양.
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	Of course. I would've met you
		at the office,
		사실 회사에서 뵈었어야 했는데 
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	but I j--I couldn't go in
		after I heard the news.
		얘길 듣곤 출근할 수가 없었어요 
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	How long were
		you and Mr. Castro engaged?
		약혼하신진 얼마나 된 상황이었죠? 
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	Almost a year.
		일년 정도요 
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	We'd been together
		about two years before that.
		그 전에 2년간 사귄 사이였어요 
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	And how did you meet?
		어떻게 만나셨죠? 
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	Through work.
		회사에서요 
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	I'm with a P.R. agency
		전 삼촌 회사를 포함해 
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	that handles financial firms,
		including my uncle's.
		금융 회사를 상대하는 PR 에이전시에 다녀요 
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	Most of the guys that work in
		finance are overgrown frat boys,
		금융 회사 남자들은 대부분 몸만 웃자란 
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	but...
		애어른 같은데 
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	Antonio was a man.
		안토니오는 그렇지 않았어요 
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	Maybe it was his time
		in the service. I don't know.
		군대 경험 덕일수도 있고, 모르겠네요
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	But...
		하지만
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	He was a great soul.
		정말 멋진 사람이었어요 
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	He was wise
		현명하고 
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	and kind.
		자상하고 
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:02	I'm sorry.
		죄송해요 
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	I thought
		I was ready for this.
		울지 않을 수 있을줄 알았는데 
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	Did he have any enemies?
		적대하는 사람은 있었나요? 
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	Antonio had a very strong sense
		of morality.
		도덕심이 남달랐어요 
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	He believed in right and wrong
		정확한 시비 분별과 
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	and would tell you
		which was which.
		사리 판단을 중시했죠 
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	I loved him for that,
		전 그 점이 마음에 들었어요 
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	but not everyone did.
		하지만 모두가 그렇진 않았죠 
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	Anyone in particular?
		구체적으로 꼽자면? 
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	I can't think of anyone
		offhand.
		갑자기 떠오르는 사람은 없네요 
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	Uh, Lisbon, my head's a little
		foggy and, uh, drifty,
		리스본, 내가 지금 머리가 좀
		어지럽고 깨끗지 못해서 말이야 
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	so I'm gonna push it along
		a bit.
		좀 단도직입적으로 갈게 
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	What are you guilty about?
		지금 죄책감을 느끼는 이유가 뭡니까?
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:38	I don't understand.
		무슨 말씀이신지.... 
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	All--all the tears and talk
		about how wonderful he was.
		주룩주룩 우는거나 피해자에 대한
		온갖 좋은 회고담들요 
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	He's been gone a year,
		죽은지 일년된 사람입니다 
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	and you're behaving like
		he disappeared this morning.
		그런데 아직도 오늘 아침 실종된
		사람 말하듯 하고 있군요 
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	That's guilt.
		죄책감 때문이죠 
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	No, it's not.
		아니에요 
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	It's not quite homicidal,
		but there's something.
		반드시 살인 행위와 관련이 있다고 
		하긴 그렇고, 다른 이유로군요 
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	Were you cheating on him?
		바람 피웠습니까?
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	No.
		아니요 
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	Not while he was alive.
		살아있는 동안은 아니었던 것 같고 
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	I bet now. Yes, that's it.
		요새 하고 있구나, 그래 그래요 
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	You've been sleeping around
		on the sainted dead fiance.
		죽은 성인군자 남자친구 대신
		요새 바람 피우느라 정신 없군요 
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	No, I haven't.
		아니에요 
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	Tell us the truth.
		솔직하게 말씀하세요 
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:07	Well, it's complicated.
		상황이 복잡해요 
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	It's simple.
		실은 간단합니다 
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	You've moved on. It happens.
		그냥 인정하고 살아가세요, 
		그런 일 많습니다 
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	You just don't want to admit it
		because you think it looks bad.
		나쁜 사람으로 비춰질까봐 두려워
		인정하지 못하는 것 뿐이에요 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Are you trying
		to make me cry again?
		저 다시 우는거 보고 싶으세요? 
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	No, I'm not. I mean, I'm not,
		아니에요, 정말 아니에요, 아니고 
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	but if you want to, then...
		하지만 본인이 원하신다면야 
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	please, cry.
		Jane.
		- 우세요, 시원하게
		- 제인 
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Get it out.
		Jane.
		- 토해내버려요
		- 제인 
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Who is it, Marcy?
		누구예요, 마시? 
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:27	Hey, Cho, so Marcy Victor was
		sleeping with Ian Breitler,
		조, 마시 빅터가 이안 브레이틀러와
		자는 사이였어 
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	which Breitler conveniently
		forgot to tell us
		처음 만났을땐 브레이틀러가 
		참 편리하게도 
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	when we talked to him.
		우리한테 그 사실 말해주는걸 잊었나봐 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	Pick him up. See what
		he has to say for himself.
		우리쪽으로 데려와서 무슨 변명을
		늘어놓는지 봐야겠어 
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:41	Why did you hide your
		relationship with Marcy Victor,
		왜 마시 빅터와의 관계를 숨겼습니까 
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	Mr. Breitler?
		브레이틀러씨? 
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	Antonio was a sensitive topic
		around the office, okay?
		안토니오 문제는 회사에서
		아주 민감한 사안이었어요 
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	Until you guys found him,
		시신이 발견되기 전까진 
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	a lot of people were hoping
		많은 사람들이 이제나 저제나 
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	he'd come walking back
		through the door.
		안토니오가 돌아오지 않을까
		바랐습니다 
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	Since you're sleeping
		with his fiancee,
		그의 약혼녀와 자는 사이였으니 
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	I'm guessing
		you're not one of 'em.
		당신은 그 중 하나가 아니었겠군요 
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	I just didn't think
		that the time to announce
		안토니오가 죽었다는게 밝혀진 직후 
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	that Marcy and I are a couple
		실은 마시와 제가 커플이었다는 걸
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	was when we had just found out
		that Antonio was dead.
		대놓고 말하긴 어렵겠다 생각한 것 뿐이에요 
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	Hey, Cho.
		여어, 조 
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	Ian, what is that on your...
		이안, 자켓에 이거 이거... 
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	Jacket? There's... eh.
		뭡니까? 
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	What?
		뭐요?
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	It's a hair.
		That could be a clue.
		머리카락이네, 단서가 될 수도 있겠어 
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	It's my hair.
		제 머리카락인데 
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	Hmm. Fair enough.
		그랬군요, 쌤쌤이네요 
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	Ian doesn't think
		there's anything
		이안은 마시 빅터와의 관계가 
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	significant about his
		relationship with Marcy Victor.
		사건에 대단한 의미는 없다고 합니다 
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	Yes, I'm inclined to agree.
		나도 실은 상당히 이안 편이야 
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	Sleazy, maybe,
		추잡했다고 말할 순 있지만 
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	but motive for murder?
		I don't think so.
		살인 동기? 그것까진 아닌것 같아 
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	I'm more interested
		in Ian's other secret.
		난 이안의 다른 비밀에 더 관심이 있어 
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	What's that?
		뭔데요? 
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	The one that you
		and Dennis Victor were keeping.
		당신과 데니스 빅터가 숨기는 거요 
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	The one that has to do
		with Antonio Castro's work.
		안토니오의 회사 일과 관련된 것 
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:41	Don't know what
		you're talking about.
		무슨 말씀이신지 모르겠네요 
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	Oh.
		 
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	You're tensing up, Ian.
		점점 긴장하고 있네요 
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	And you have asthma.
		That's not good.
		그런데 천식 환자시니 안됐군요 
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	That kind of tension goes
		straight to the lungs,
		그런 종류의 긴장은 즉시 
		폐에 영향을 끼칩니다 
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	squeezes them,
		폐를 조여서 
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	makes them get smaller
		and smaller.
		폐가 점점 작게 쪼그라들지요 
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Is there a question here?
		이게 심문이에요? 
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	The windpipe shrinks up,
		숨구멍이 수축되고 
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	and every breath you take is
		harder than the last.
		매번의 호흡이 점점 더 어려워질 겁니다 
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	It's hard to breathe.
		숨쉬기가 힘들어집니다 
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	The last thing you want to do
		is get upset.
		여기서 화라도 내면 끝장이지요 
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	- This is ridiculous.
		- Don't panic. What are you looking for?
		- 정말이지 어처구니가 없네요 
		- 당황하지 마세요, 찾으시는게 뭔가요? 
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	What is it? Is it this?
		뭐죠? 이건가? 
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	Gimme that.
		내놔요 
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	Tell me what I need to know.
		내가 물어본거 대답해요 
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:15	You can't do that. He can't--
		he can't do that.
		이러시면 안되죠, 이 사람 이러면 안되잖아요?
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	He's doing it.
		하는걸 어쩝니까 
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:19	Yeah, you know,
		you're probably right.
		이러면 안될지도 모르죠 
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:21	Changed my mind.
		근데 맘이 바뀌었네 
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	For God sake.
		제발 좀!
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	I'm calling my lawyer.
		변호사 부르겠어요 
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	Sure. Go ahead. It'll only take
		him an hour to get here.
		그러세요, 한시간이면 오겠죠 
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:36	Castro was a thief.
		카스트로는 도둑놈이었어요 
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	He was stealing
		from the firm.
		회삿돈을 훔쳤습니다 
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	We didn't find out
		until after he disappeared,
		놈이 사라진 후에야 알았어요 
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	when Marx took over
		his accounts.
		막스가 계좌를 인수한 뒤 알아냈죠 
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	Mm.
		 
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:48	Hey!
		이봐요!
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	Come on!
		제발! 
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:55	How much did Castro steal?
		카스트로가 얼마를 훔쳤대? 
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	Breitler says
		he doesn't know.
		브라이틀러는 모른답니다 
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:58	Marx and Dennis Victor
		정확한 금액은 막스와 데니스 빅터만 
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	didn't share the numbers
		with anyone else.
		알고 나머지는 모른다는군요 
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	- Why didn't they tell us that to start with?
		- Victor's order.
		- 왜 처음부터 그 얘길 않았지? 
		- 빅터가 못하게 막았습니다 
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	No one was allowed to say
		anything about it.
		회사 사람 아무도 언급하지 
		못하게 되어 있습니다 
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	All right, let's bring him in
		and sort it out.
		알았어, 브라이틀러는 알아서 처리해 
00:22:06	 
		 
00:22:06	Sure.
		Hey.
		- 네
		- 아 그래 
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:10	How does Jane seem to you?
		네가 볼땐 제인 어떤 것 같아? 
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	Different.
		평소와 다릅니다 
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	I think he's in trouble.
		뭔가 문제가 있는 것 같습니다 
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Me, too. Where is he?
		나도 그래, 지금 어딨지? 
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	He said he still had a headache.
		Went out to go get some aspirin.
		아직 두통이 있다며 아스피린
		사온다고 나갔습니다 
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:20	All right.
		알았어
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:24	Mr. Wineman.
		와인맨씨 
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	Beautiful cemetery.
		아름다운 묘지로군요 
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:29	You should be proud.
		자부심을 가져도 좋을 것 같습니다 
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:31	So neat.
		정갈하게 조성하셨네요 
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:33	Mm. Thank you. Uh, what--what
		can I do for you, Mr. Jane?
		감사합니다, 그런데 제가 뭘 도와드리면
		되나요 제인씨? 
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	Well, like I said on the phone,
		um, I'm with the CBI.
		전화로 말씀드렸다시피 
		전 CBI에서 일하고 있습니다 
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	We're pursuing
		a particularly vicious killer.
		저희는 극히 포악한 살인범을
		쫓는 중입니다 
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	Tough case.
		힘든 사건이죠 
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:43	But with your help,
		we can crack it.
		하지만 그쪽 도움이면 해결할 수 있습니다 
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:45	You're not using this grave
		right away, are you?
		이 묘지 당장은 안 쓰시는 거죠? 
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	No. The services aren't until
		the day after tomorrow.
		네 장례식은 모레입니다 
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:51	Good. We'll be done by then.
		좋아요, 그 전까진 끝날겁니다 
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Wh-what do you mean "done"?
		끝내다니... 뭘 말씀이시죠? 
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	We need to run
		a small police operation here.
		소규모 작전을 여기서 치를 예정입니다 
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	Nothing I can tell you about,
		but you can help us.
		자세히 말씀드릴 수는 없지만
		몹시 위험한 범죄자를 거리에서 제거하는데
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	Help us remove a very dangerous
		killer from the street.
		큰 도움이 될 겁니다 
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	You want to help us,
		don't you?
		저희를 돕고 싶으시죠? 
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	You'll help us?
		도와주실거죠?

00:25:59	Oh.

		a member,
		조카분이 회원이니 
00:26:14

		was asked about joining.
		안토니오 카스트로씨도 
		가입을 제안 받았겠군요 
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	Yes.
		Yeah.
		네 
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:20	Shortly before he disappeared.
		실종되기 직전 일이었죠 
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	Right. And to become a member

		신참으로 들어가려면 
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	uh, I'm assuming you need to
		have some kind of a hazing.
		뭔가 신고식 같은걸 치를 것 같은데 
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	Yes.
		맞아요

		by current members
		예비 회원은 기존 회원한테 찍혀

00:26:39

		그때도 회원이 모였나요? 
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:46	As a matter of fact, it was.
		Antonio was there as a guest.
		사실을 말하자면 그랬습니다,
		안토니오는 손님 자격으로 있었죠 
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:50	Mm.
		 
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	You interested in membership,
		Mr. Jane?
		회원 가입이라도 하시게요? 
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:53	Me?
		Yeah.

00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	Uh, no. No.
		아뇨, 아니에요 
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	- Not the club type. Thank you.
		- Oh. Hmm.
		- 전 사교클럽 타입이 아니에요 
		- 호오 
00:26:58	 
		 
00:27:00	I've got an accountant looking
		at Castro's trades,
		회계사한테 부탁해 
		안토니오의 계좌를 봐달라 했는데 
00:27:02	 
		 
00:27:02	but they're so complicated, he
		can barely make sense of them.
		너무 복잡해 이해할 수가 없다더군요 
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	What else do we have?
		이제 남은게 뭐지? 
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	I talked to 13 people
		who met with Castro
		안토니오 실종 전에 만난 사람 
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	before he disappeared.
		Nothing unusual or suspicious.
		13명과 얘기해봤는데 특이점은
		없었습니다 
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	I've been through
		all the forensic evidence

		샌프란시스코 경찰이 모아들인 
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:11	S.F.P.D. gathered from Castro's
		apartment and office.
		법의학적 증거를 모두 참조했지만 
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:14	- Nothing jumps out.
		- Time line?
		- 눈에 띄는 건 없었습니다 
		- 타임라인은? 
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:16	Nothing that leads
		anywhere.

		- 어디로?

00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	Very simple ones.
		Uh, you, ma'am,

00:28:09	suggest money trouble. True?
		돈 문제로 쪼들리고 계시는군요? 
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	No. No, I've--no, we're fine.
		아니, 난 ...아니에요, 우린 괜찮아요

00:28:13	Uh, we're fine.
		우린 괜찮아요

		보셨죠? 거짓말입니다 
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:18	Did you kill Antonio Castro?
		안토니오 카스트로를 죽였습니까? 
00:28:20

00:28:33	You're not committed to him

		하지만 마음은 주지 않았어요 
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	he's half the man that
		your fiance was, do you?
		당신 약혼자에 비하면 순 
		어린애 같은 놈이라고 생각하니까 
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	No, that's not true.
		그렇지 않아요 
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	A lie.
		Thank you very much.

00:28:46	Is this some kind of joke?
		지금 이거 농담하시는 거죠?
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	Please be patient.
		Take a seat, ma'am.
		참을성 있게 앉아 계세요 
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:50	Mr. Marx, you're more
		than a little twisted
		막스씨, 침실에선 
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	in the bedroom, aren't you?
		좀더 기괴한 캐릭터가 되는 편이죠? 
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:54	Latex and whips are your thing,
		are they not?
		라텍스나 채찍 같은데 능숙하시죠 
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:58	Not at all.
		전혀요 
00:28:59	 
		 
00:28:59	Did you kill Antonio Castro?
		안토니오 카스트로를 죽였습니까? 
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	No, I did not.
		아닙니다 
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	Hmm. Uh, you, sir.
		선생님 
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	If you think
		I'm saying a word
		내가 변호사를 동석하지 않고 
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:08	without a lawyer on either side
		of me, you're crazy.
		단 한마디라도 할 줄 알았다면
		당신은 제정신이 아닌거요 
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:10	And any of you that put up with
		this is as crazy as he is.
		그리고 이걸 참고 견디는 사람도
		저 자만큼 미친게 틀림없소 
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	Ladies and gentlemen.
		신사 숙녀 여러분 
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	If everybody could just stay
		in the room, please.
		자리에 머물러 주십시오 
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:22	I don't understand.
		What were you trying to do?
		이해가 안되네요, 뭘 하려고 하신거죠? 
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:26	The plan was to, uh,
		계획은 말이죠 
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	scare the killer
		into making a run for it.
		범인을 겁줘서 도망가는 걸 잡는 거였어요
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:31	You thought that would work?
		그게 될줄 아셨어요? 
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:32	Certainly had a fair chance,
		가능성은 상당했다...
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:34	I thought.
		저는 그렇게 생각했습니다
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	I'm gonna go tell Rigsby
		and the others to stand down.
		릭스비랑 애들한테 사람들 놔두라고 
		가서 말해야겠어 
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	You stay here.
		넌 여기 꼼짝말고 있어 
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:46	Yeah, it was crazy.
		완전 미쳤더라고 
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	I'll tell you about it
		when I get there.
		도착해서 얘기해줄게 
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:49	All right. Bye.
		그래, 안녕
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:51	Marx!
		막스!
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	Mr. Jane.
		제인씨 
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:53	That didn't work out for you,
		so well, did it?
		아깐 생각처럼 일이 잘 안 됐네요 
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	No, it went pretty much
		as planned.
		아주 계획대로 순조롭게 풀리는 중입니다 
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	- The case is cracked.
		- Oh, yeah?
		- 사건은 해결됐어요 
		- 그래요?
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	Is that your car?
		당신 차입니까? 
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	Yep.
		네 
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	- Wow. That's a nice ride.
		- Thanks.
		- 잘빠졌네요 
		- 감사합니다 
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	Let's take a little drive.
		I'll tell you all about it.
		잠시 드라이브라도 합시다,
		모두 설명해 드릴테니까요 
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:06	Ride where?
		어디로요?
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:07	Oh, not far.
		멀지 않아요 
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	I mean, don't you want to be
		the first to know who did it?
		범인을 아는 첫번째 사람이 되는
		행운을 누리고 싶지 않습니까?
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:12	Okay.
		그러죠 
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	What's in the bag?
		봉지 안에는 뭡니까? 
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	Oh, a baby monitor.
		아기용 cctv요 
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:19	I-I'll explain later.
		나중에 설명할게요 
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:35	Turn right up here.
		여기서 오른쪽이요 
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	So how exactly did that mess
		back at the club
		아까 클럽에서의 그 망신살이 
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	work out for you, Mr. Jane?
		대체 무슨 역할을 했다는 거죠? 
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:44	Wasn't looking for a killer.
		범인을 찾기 위한 게 아니었습니다 
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	I was looking for a liar.
		전 거짓말쟁이를 찾고 있었어요 
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	Someone that can answer
		an embarrassing question
		공개적인 장소에서도 
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	in public
		without getting flustered.
		창피한 질문에 당황하지 않고
		대답할 수 있는 사람이요 
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	Mm.
		 
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	Why was that important?
		그게 왜 중요합니까? 
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	Castro's killer was
		a vicious sadist.
		카스트로를 죽인 범인은
		잔인한 새디스트였습니다 
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	Someone that truly enjoyed
		watching other people's pain.
		다른 사람의 고통을 보며
		진심으로 기뻐하는 인간이죠 
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	He can't show it,
		그걸 감출 수 있는 
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	ergo, a first-rate liar.
		즉 일류의 거짓말쟁이죠 
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:07	And you found him?
		그 자를 찾았습니까? 
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	Sure.
		물론
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:12	It was you.
		바로 당신입니다 
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	Turn, uh, here.
		여기서 꺾으세요 
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	Me?
		저요? 
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	I noticed when we first talked,
		you and, uh, Victor and Breitler
		처음 만나 얘기할때 느꼈습니다.
		당신과 빅터, 브레이틀러가 
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	said that Castro hadn't done
		anything wrong,
		카스트로가 직장에서 문제를
		일으킨 적이 없다고 했죠 
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	and I could tell
		the other two were lying,
		나머지 둘은 거짓말이 확실했는데 
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:26	but you seemed
		to be telling the truth.
		하지만 당신은 사실대로 말하는 것 
		같았어요 
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	And not too many people
		fool me like that.
		제 눈을 속일 수 있는 사람이
		얼마 되지 않는데도요 
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	So I tested you again
		at the club.
		그래서 클럽에서 다시 시험해봤죠 
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	Oh, yeah?
		그래요?
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	Mm.
		 
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	How'd I do?
		제가 어떻던가요?
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Outstanding.
		탁월했습니다 
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	One of the best liars
		I've ever seen.
		제가 만나본 가운데 최고의 거짓말쟁이었습니다 
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:44	It explains your success
		in sales
		즉 당신의 뛰어난 업무 성취도와 
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	and, uh, the kinky sex life.
		변태같은 섹스 라이프를 모두
		설명하는 점이겠죠 
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	Just, uh, just--just pull in
		a little up here.
		저 앞에 세워주세요 
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:59	 
		 
00:32:03	None of that means
		I killed Antonio.
		그렇다고 해서 제가 안토니오를
		죽인게 되진 않죠 
00:32:05	 
		 
00:32:05	Sure, it does.
		됩니다 
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	I can prove it.
		증명할 수 있습니다 
00:32:08	 
		 
00:32:08	How?
		어떻게요? 
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	Walk with me,
		and I'll show you.
		같이 좀 걸어가시죠, 보여드릴테니 
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:19	Castro didn't take the money.
		카스트로는 돈을 훔치지 않았습니다 
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	Too much of a boy scout.
		보이 스카우트 타입이었거든요 
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	It was you that stole it.
		돈을 훔친 건 당신이었죠 
00:32:26	 
		 
00:32:26	Castro had figured out
		that someone was stealing,
		카스트로는 횡령 사실을 눈치채고 
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	so he, uh, he came to you.
		당신에게 보고했습니다 
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	Why?
		Because you're his boss.
		당신이 직속 상관이었으니까요 
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	What he didn't realize--
		that you were also the thief.
		당신이 도둑이라는 걸 몰랐던거죠 
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	Something's wrong
		with the future tallies.
		선물 장부에 이상한게 있어요 
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	I-I just can't put my finger
		on what.
		저로선 밝혀낼 수가 없어요 
00:32:40	 
		 
00:32:40	All right.
		알겠어 
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	Okay. I'll look into it.
		내가 살펴보지 
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:45	Then you had to kill him.
		그러자 카스트로를 죽여야했겠죠 
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	How exactly did I do that?
		정확히 내가 뭘 어쨌단 겁니까? 
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	Kind of brilliantly,
		I have to say.
		탁월함에 이은 탁월함
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	The 19:24 club was
		the ticket.
		19:24 클럽은 일종의 티켓이었죠 
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	Castro was gonna join,
		카스트로는 가입이 예정되어 있었어요 
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	and the night the charity
		function took place,
		자선 파티가 열린 그날 밤 
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	you told him he was
		gonna be initiated,
		당신은 카스트로에게 회원으로
		추천되었다고 말했죠 
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	but he had to be hazed first.
		하지만 신고식부터 치러야 한다구요 
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	You ready?
		준비됐나? 
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	Now?
		지금요? 
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:03	Shh. It's supposed to be
		a surprise.
		이런 건 늘 불시에 닥친다고 
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	Get your car
		and meet me around the corner.
		차를 가지고 건물 모퉁이에서 만나 
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	I'm gonna drive you there.
		But don't tell anybody
		거기서 내 차로 바꿔타지, 
		하지만 아무에게도 어디로 가는지 
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	where you're going
		or what you're doing, okay?
		뭘 하러 가는지는 비밀이야, 알았지? 
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:12	Exactly how embarrassing is
		this gonna be?
		신고식이요, 얼마나 창피한 겁니까? 
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	Awesomely, my brother.
		상상 이상이지, 이 친구야 
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:18	But I do have...
		하지만 
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	A little help here for you.
		내가 약간 팁을 주지 
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:24	Make it go a lot easier.
		훨씬 잘 견뎌질거야 
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:27	Trust me.
		날 믿으라구 
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:30	So you took him
		to the factory.
		당신은 카스트로를 공장으로 태워갑니다 
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:33	You walked him downstairs...
		계단을 내려가 
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	to the basement.
		지하실로 데려갔죠 
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:42	He did everything you asked.
		카스트로는 당신이 시키는 대로
		순순히 응했습니다 
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:47	What the hell?
		Yeah.
		이런! 
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:51	It'll be all right.
		괜찮을거야 
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:56	You can do it.
		할 수 있어 
00:33:59	 
		 
00:34:07	You good?
		괜찮아?
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	Yeah. What now?
		이젠 어떡해요?
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:09	Just you wait.
		이제 기다려 
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:17	And then you went
		to his house
		그리고 당신은 카스트로 집으로 가 
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	and sent e-mails
		from his computer,
		그의 컴퓨터로 메일을 보내
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	so that no one could connect
		his disappearance
		아무도 그의 실종과 클럽 사이 연관을 
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	with the club or you.
		눈치채지 못하게 손을 썼죠 
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:26	Mm. Well, this--that sounds
		pretty cool.
		훌륭한 얘기네요 
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	Except Castro was a thief.
		카스트로가 진짜 도둑이었다는 것만 빼면 
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:31	All the trades were
		on his account.
		모든 거래는 그의 계좌로 이루어졌습니다 
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	You had weeks
		to fake that data.
		계좌를 인수해 몇 주간 만졌으니
		조작할 수 있잖아요 
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	I bet that wasn't very hard
		for you.
		당신에겐 그리 어려운 일도 아니었을텐데요 
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	Ooh. Gosh, I must be
		a very bad man.
		그럼 제가 아주 나쁜 사람이 되는 거네요 
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:44	Vicious and heartless.
		잔인하고 무정하죠 
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	You gave Castro the most
		terrifying death possible.
		당신은 상상할 수 있는 가장 
		끔찍한 방식으로 카스트로를 죽였습니다 
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:54	You're evil.
		너는 악마야 
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:56	Where's your proof?
		증거는? 
00:34:58	 
		 
00:35:00	You're gonna confess to me.
		나한테 자백해야지 
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	- Oh, yeah?
		- Yeah.
		- 그래?
		- 응 
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	Why would I do that?
		내가 왜? 
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:11	What, you're gonna scare me
		into saying that I did it?
		뭐, 날 겁줘서 불게라도 하려고?
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:14	That's your plan?
		그게 그쪽 계획이야? 
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:18	Yeah, that's the plan.
		그래, 그럴 계획이야 
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:45	Hey.
		여 
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	Good morning, Lisbon.
		좋은 아침이야, 리스본
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	Got your message.
		문자 받았어 
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:52	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐하는 거야? 
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	Resting.
		휴식 
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:56	Solved the case.
		사건 풀었어 
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	Really?
		정말? 
00:35:59	 
		 
00:35:59	Yeah, it was Benjamin Marx.
		범인은 벤자민 막스야 
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:01	He stole the money,
		killed Castro,
		놈이 돈을 훔치고 카스트로를 죽였어 
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:03	and pinned the theft on him.
		그리고 카스트로에게 누명을 씌웠지 
00:36:04	 
		 
00:36:04	How do you know that?
		어떻게 알았어?
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:06	He's gonna confess.
		곧 자백할거야 
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:07	Gonna confess?
		곧? 
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:09	Mm. Very soon, I think.
		얼마 안 걸릴걸 
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:11	Where is he?
		어딨는데?
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	Uh...
		음... 
00:36:16
