00:00:13	High school, huh? Must bring
		back some memories for you.
		고등학교 오니까 어때, 
		추억이 새록새록 솟아나지 않아?
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	Friday nights,
		your friends from band,
		금요일 밤에 말야, 밴드 친구들
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	strapping on
		those funny hats.
		걔네 이상한 모자, 
		같이 몰려 다니던 기억 같은 
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	You know what?
		I am not gonna take the bait.
		애쓰지 마, 맞장구 안 쳐줄거니까 
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	And then after practice,
		a little spin the bottle...
		연습 끝나면 우드락 댄 녹음실에서
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	in some wood-paneled
		rec room.
		술병을 돌리며 진실게임
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	Whatever you say.
		맘대로 지껄여라
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:30	Rigsby,
		what have we got?
		릭스비, 알아낸건? 
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	Jack McTierney. 28.
		English teacher.
		잭 맥티어리, 28세고 영어 교사입니다 
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	M.E. puts the time of death
		검시관 의견으론 사망 추정 시간은 
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	between 6:00 and 9:00
		last night.
		어제 오후 6시에서 9시 사이구요 
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	Apparently he likes to
		stay late and go jogging
		교내에 늦게 남아 
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	around the campus.
		운동장에서 조깅하는 걸 즐겼답니다 
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	Cho's searching
		his locker now.
		선배가 이 사람 사물함 보고 있어요 
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:45	Looks like it's a blunt-force
		trauma to the head.
		머리를 둔기로 내리 찍었군
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	We have a murder weapon?
		흉기는 발견됐어? 
00:00:48	 
		 
00:00:48	No, but the M.E.
		thinks it was metal.
		아직요. 검시관 소견으론 금속성 물체래요 
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	When we got here, there were
		bats in the equipment bins.
		장비함에 야구 배트가 있던데 
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:52	We're testing them
		for blood now.
		수거해서 혈흔 조사하고 있어요 
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Did we contact the family?
		유족에겐 알렸어? 
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	Yeah, but they're all
		back east.
		그런데 다 동부에 산대요 
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	He's single,
		lives alone.
		미혼이고 혼자 살았어요 
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	All right,
		start setting up interviews--
		알았어, 6시에서 9시 사이에 
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	anybody who was here between
		6:00 and 9:00 last night.
		교내에 있던 사람들 조사해서
		심문하게 준비해 
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:01	You got it.
		알겠습니다 
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:02	Look at that bruising
		around the eye.
		눈에 멍든거 봐 
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	Mm. It's faded.
		많이 지워졌네 
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	Looks like it's about
		a week old.
		일주일 전쯤 일로 보이는걸 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	Be good to know
		how that happened.
		어쩌다 생겼는지 알면 좋을텐데 
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:09	Well, let's ask
		the principal.
		그건 교장한테 물어보자구 
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:12	That guy?
		저 남자?
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	Cheap power suit, phone holster,
		Bluetooth, large watch.
		값싼 양복, 혁대에 매다는 휴대폰 케이스,
		블루투스 이어폰에 알이 큰 시계 
00:01:17	 
		 
00:01:17	Has "petty tyrant"
		written all over him.
		"저는 속좁은 독재자입니다"라고 
		말하고 있잖아 
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	Excuse me! Sir?
		실례합니다
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:21	Hi. I'm Agent Lisbon.
		This is Patrick Jane.
		저는 리스본 요원이고 이쪽은 패트릭 제인
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	We're with the CBI.
		CBI에서 나왔습니다 
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:25	Principal Carl Snyder.
		교장인 칼 스나이더입니다 
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	Thank you so much
		for coming so quickly.
		신속한 출동에 감사드립니다 
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:29	Uh, did Mr. McTierney
		have any problems?
		맥티어리씨에게 무슨 문제는 없었나요?
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	Trouble with a student?
		- No, I don't think so.
		- 학생과 트러블이라든가? 
		- 아니요 
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	He was a great teacher.
		그는 훌륭한 교사였습니다 
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	He started working here
		right after college.
		대학 졸업후 바로 부임했죠 
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	Uh, bright kid.
		Could have made money
		다른 돈 잘버는 일도 많을텐데 
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	doing so many things,
		but he loved teaching.
		교사를 천직으로 알았어요 
00:01:41	 
		 
00:01:41	- We were lucky to have him.
		- Mm.
		그런 사람과 일해 행운이었죠 
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:43	Now I have
		a grief counseling session
		조금 후 추모식을 진행해야 해서 
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:46	starting momentarily, so thank--
		- Excellent. We'll come.
		- 저는 이만... 
		- 그것 잘됐네요, 저희도 가죠 
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:48	Uh, how did he get
		the black eye?
		그런데 맥티어리씨 눈에는 왜 멍이? 
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:51	He said that he...
		was playing basketball
		학생들과 방과 후에 
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	with some students
		after school.
		야구를 하다 그렇게 됐다 하던데요 
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	But you didn't believe him?
		그런데 그 말을 안 믿으셨죠? 
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	Well, why would he lie?
		Of course I believed him.
		그가 왜 거짓말을 하겠습니까?
		믿고말고요 
00:01:58	 
		 
00:01:58	No, you didn't.
		안 믿으시는데 
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	Well, why would @@/I@@\ lie?
		제가 그런 걸로 거짓말을 왜 합니까? 
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:01	Probably just
		bureaucratic instinct.
		관료의 직감이랄까 
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	Now if you suspected
		that the black eye story
		야구하다 다쳤다는게 핑계란건 아시고 
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:05	was false, did you have
		any notion of the true story?
		진짜 이유는 뭐였는지 짐작하십니까? 
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:08	- No.
		- Hmm?
		- 아니요
		- 으음?
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	Like I said, he was very
		popular among everyone--
		맥티어리는 누구에게나 인기가 좋았어요 
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	students and faculty alike.
		학생들에게나 교직원에게나 모두 
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	Not everyone. I went
		through McTierney's locker.
		모두까진 아닌듯 합니다.
		맥티어리 사물함에 갔다왔어요 
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	Nothing unusual. But I found
		this in his briefcase.
		특이한건 없었지만 서류가방에서
		이걸 발견했습니다 
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:24	Oh. This is
		very interesting.
		이거 재밌네 
00:02:27	 
		 
00:02:28	I had the honor of working
		with Jack McTierney
		잭 맥티어리와 5년을 함께 일한건
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	for the past five years.
		행운이었죠 
00:02:32	 
		 
00:02:32	He was a good teacher,
		맥티어리는 훌륭한 교사였습니다 
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	and he will be missed.
		우리 가슴 속에 남을 겁니다 
00:02:38	 
		 
00:02:38	Thank you, Mr. Loveland.
		감사합니다 러브랜드 선생님
00:02:40	 
		 
00:02:40	Now is there anyone else who
		would like to say something...
		다음 누구라도 남길 말이 있나요?
00:02:44	 
		 
00:02:44	 
		 
00:02:45	about Mr. McTierney?
		맥티어리 선생님에 대해서? 
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:51	We--well, I'd--
		I'd like to say something.
		제가 좀 말했으면 하는데요 
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54	Mr. Jane,
		제인씨 
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	this is a very sensitive
		moment.
		이건 아주 민감한 시기란 말입니다 
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	Yeah, they're just teenagers.
		They'll get over it.
		겨우 십대인걸요, 다 이겨낼 거예요 
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:02	Good morning, everyone.
		I'm Patrick Jane.
		좋은 아침입니다, 난 패트릭 제인이에요
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	I'm with the CBI.
		CBI에서 나왔습니다 
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	I'm sorry for everyone's loss.
		Uh...
		여러분의 불행에 조의를 표합니다 
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	I know you were close
		to Mr. McTierney,
		맥티어리 선생과 친했다는건 알아요 
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	and I was hoping
		that one of you could tell me
		그리고 우리가 발견한 이 편지를 
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	who wrote this letter
		that we found.
		누가 쓴건지 누군가 가르쳐줬으면 합니다 
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:20	"Dear Mr. McT..."
		맥티어리 선생님
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	"I saw what you did,
		and I'm disgusted.
		당신이 한 짓을 보고 구역질이 났습니다 
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	You are a total pig,"
		exclamation point.
		이 더러운 돼지 같으니, 하고
		느낌표 파파팍
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	"I used to
		think you were special,
		특별한 분이라 생각했는데 
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	"but you're just a hypocrite
		like the rest of them.
		다른 사람과 마찬가지로 위선자일 뿐이었어 
00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:34	I can't believe I ever
		thought you were cool."
		당신을 멋지다고 생각했다니 내가 바보야 
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:39	"I hate you."
		당신이 싫어 
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	Who would write
		such a letter? Hmm?
		이런 편지를 누가 쓴거죠? 
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:45	Clearly someone
		who felt betrayed.
		배신당했다고 여기는 누군가겠죠 
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:48	A sensitive soul who now
		feels deep remorse
		지금은 이토록 심한 말을 쓴데에
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	for having spoken so harshly.
		깊은 후회를 느끼는 여린 영혼 말입니다 
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	Someone seated right here
		in this room.
		지금 이 곳에 앉아있는 
00:03:58	 
		 
00:03:58	Yes.
		그래요
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:03	You.
		학생
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:05	While everyone else
		was looking around
		모두가 주변을 두리번거리며
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	trying to figure out
		who wrote the letter,
		편지를 쓴 사람을 궁금해하는데 
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:08	you weren't.
		혼자만 아니었죠 
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	You knew who wrote
		the letter,
		누가 썼는지 아니까 
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	because it was you.
		자기가 쓴 거니까 
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:13	Isn't that right?
		그렇지 않은가요? 
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	I'm sorry.
		죄송해요 
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:16	I'm sorry.
		죄송해요!
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	Lisbon, you're on.
		리스본, 네 차례야 
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	Wow.
		와우
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	Hey!
		이봐!
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	Hey, stop!
		거기 서라! 
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:25	Drama, huh?
		극적이죠 참? 
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	Anyone else have
		anything to say?
		그럼 다음 누구라도 남길 말이 있나요?

		왜 이런 편지를 썼지, 레이첼? 
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:44	Mr. McT
		was my favorite teacher.
		맥티어리 선생님은 제가 가장
		좋아하는 분이었어요 
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:48	He always talked about
		self-respect.
		항상 자기 존중에 대해 말씀하셨고 
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	He wanted us girls to
		value ourselves for our minds.
		여학생들에게 스스로를 귀하게
		여겨야 한다고 하셨어요 
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	I-I mean, he was cool
		with us.
		권위적이지 않았어요 
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:58	He didn't treat us
		like idiot kids.
		우릴 애들 다루듯이 하지도 않았구요 
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	Well, what changed?
		그런데 뭐가 바뀐거지? 
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	Three nights ago,
		I was driving
		3일전 
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	to the Food Bank
		where I volunteer.
		푸드뱅크로 자원봉사 가는 길이었어요 
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	It's in kind of
		a sketchy neighborhood.
		여기서 멀지 않은데 
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	And I saw Mr. McTierney
		talking to, like...
		맥티어리 선생님이 그... 
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	a hooker.
		창녀랑 얘기하고 있었어요 
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:13	And they were fighting.
		둘이 싸우는 것 같았고 
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:15	Well, arguing.
		말다툼이요 
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	And then she got
		into his car.
		여자가 선생님 차에 탔어요 
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	I mean... he's a teacher.
		교사가 어떻게 그럴 수 있어요 
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	What did she look like?
		여자 생김새는 어땠지? 
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	Here. I took a picture.
		사진을 찍어놨어요 
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:31	Text me that picture
		내 번호로 그 사진이랑 
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	and the address that you
		saw her. Excuse me.
		여자를 본 주소랑 보내줘 
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	Cho, what's up?
		조, 무슨 일이야? 
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	Forensics finished up.
		검시관이 연락해왔습니다 
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	None of the school's bats
		show traces of blood.
		야구 배트에선 혈흔이 검출되지 않았답니다 
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	And we found a baggie
		of homemade pills
		그리고 맥티어리 차에서 
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	in McTierney's car.
		Looks like M.D.M.A.--
		약봉지를 발견했습니다 
		메틸렌다이옥시메스암페타민... 
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	Ecstasy.
		그러니까 엑스터시네요 
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	Turns out our victim
		had a few secrets.
		우리 피해자가 말못할 사정이 많았군 
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:47	I've got a student here
		여기 학생 하나가 
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	who says she saw him
		맥티어리가 매춘부와 
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	in an argument
		with a prostitute.
		말다툼하는 걸 목격했대 
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:50	I'll forward you a picture
		of the hooker and the address.
		여자랑 주소 보내줄테니 
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	You and Rigsby see
		if you can track her down.
		릭스비랑 가서 찾아내 
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	Got it.
		알겠습니다

00:06:00	Hey.
		응
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:03	Hmm? Ecstasy.
		뭐? 엑스터시라고 
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	Interesting.
		재밌네 
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:11	No, you go on. I'm gonna
		stay here.
		아니, 먼저 가. 난 여기 더 있어야 돼 
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Bye.
		안녕
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	I'm sorry. May I help you?

00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	Or...
		 
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:16	You.
		너로구나 
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	What do you want?
		원하는게 뭐예요?
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	I'm Patrick.
		What's your name?
		난 패트릭이야, 넌? 
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Krista.
		크리스타 
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	Krista. I come in peace.
		난 문제 일으킬 생각 없다 
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	So which of you crazy cats
		is gonna help me
		그럼 너희 길고양이 중 누가 
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	solve McTierney's murder, huh?
		맥티어리 선생 범인 잡는거 도와줄래? 
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	- Not me, man. Not me.
		- Let's go.
		 
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	Wow.
		 
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:34	You really are bad.
		너희 진짜 못됐구나 
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:37	What do you wanna know?
		알고 싶은게 뭐예요? 
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	Well,
		음
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	while the rest of the kids
		are stuck inside
		다른 애들이 교실에 갇혀 
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	sharpening their pencils,
		you're out here roaming free.
		연필이나 깎는 동안 넌 여기서
		자유를 만끽하고 있으니 
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	I bet you know way more about
		what's really going on, right?
		세상 돌아가는 일에 대해
		뭐라도 더 알겠지
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	Like who's selling
		the Ecstasy, for starters.
		이를테면 엑스터시를 팔고 다니는게 누군지 
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	I wish I knew someone.
		That would--
		나도 하나 알았으면 좋겠네요 
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	that would definitely be
		a popular kid.
		그럼 유명세를 탈테니 
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	What about McTierney?
		Did he have any secret vices?
		맥티어리 선생은 어땠어?
		뒤로 호박씨를 까진 않았니?
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:01	No. He--he was a square.
		맥티어리는 에프엠이었어요 
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Super clean-cut.
		바른생활 사나이 
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Which is why it's so weird
		he was tight with Mr. Loveland,
		그런데 러브랜드랑 친했다는게 이상해요 
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	'cause Loveland's
		a crazy drunk.
		러브랜드는 미친 술고랜데 
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	Loveland?
		The career counselor?
		진로 상담사 러브랜드 선생?
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	- Yeah.
		- Hmm.
		네 
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	See, a while back, um,
		좀 된 얘긴데 
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	Loveland confiscated
		my friend's cell phone.
		러브랜드가 내 친구 폰을 뺏아갔어요 
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	- Mm-hmm.
		- So my friend broke into his office
		그 친구가 러브랜드 사무실을 뜯고 들어갔는데 
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	and found like a million
		of those little
		비행기에서 주는 조그만 보드카병을
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	vodka airplane bottles...
		Empty.
		백만개도 더 봤는데 다 비어 있더래요 
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	Well, thanks, Krista.
		고맙다 크리스타 
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:31	Very much.
		아주 고마워 
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	You know, when you wake up
		tomorrow morning
		네가 내일 아침 일어나 거울을 보면
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:34	and you look in the mirror,
		you will see yourself
		태어나 처음 본 것처럼 새롭고 
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	as if for the very first time,
		and you will decide
		넌 다시는 담배를 피우지 않겠다고 
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	to never smoke cigarettes
		again.
		결심하게 된다 
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:47	Thank--thanks.
		고, 고마워요 
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:56	How did you know
		Jack McTierney?
		잭 맥티어리는 어떻게 알게됐죠? 
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	He was my teacher.
		선생님이었어요 
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	Like three years ago.
		3년전 쯤에 
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	Before I dropped out
		of school.
		중퇴하기 전에요 
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	Back then,
		he tried to help me
		그때 맥티어리 선생님은 
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	with this problem I was having
		with my stepfather.
		저랑 양아버지 문제 도와주려고 애썼어요 
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	What was the problem?
		무슨 문제? 
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:14	Take a wild guess.
		그냥 맞춰봐요 
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	If your stepfather
		was abusing you,
		양아버지가 널 학대했다면
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	you can still have him
		prosecuted.
		고발할 수도 있었잖아 
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	Whatever.
		어쨌거나 
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	I ran away to the city.
		Problem solved.
		난 집에서 나왔고 문제는 해결됐죠 
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	But I guess Mr. McTierney
		felt guilty, or something.
		그런데 맥티어리 선생님이 
		그것 때문에 죄책감을 느꼈나봐요 
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	'Cause ever since then,
		he's been trying to rescue me.
		그때부터 날 구해줄라고 했어요 
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	He freaked when I told him
		I was turning tricks.
		몸 팔고 있다고 했더니 기절하더라구요 
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	What did he say?
		그래서 뭐랬어? 
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	You know, that I could still
		have a normal life.
		아직 남들처럼 살 기회가 있다 
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	Stuff like that.
		뭐 그런 말들요 
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	Then afterward, he'd come
		to see me like once a week,
		그 다음에는 일주일에 한번씩 
		꼭 왔어요 
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	buy me a cup of coffee,
		커피를 사주거나 
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	talk to me about getting
		my G.E.D.
		검정고시를 보라거나 하면서 
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	But I didn't want to hear it.
		하지만 듣는 시늉도 안했어요 
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	So we fought.
		그래서 싸웠죠 
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:57	We found drugs on McTierney.
		Ecstasy.
		맥티어리가 엑스터시를 갖고 있었어 
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Couldn't have been
		his stuff.
		선생님게 아니었을 거예요 
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	He was a total
		straight arrow.
		완전 성인군자였으니까 
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	Was it yours?
		네거니?
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	Ecstasy?
		엑스터시요? 
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	That's for amateurs.
		아마추어들이나 쓰는거지 
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	Do you know if he was having
		any problems at school?
		맥티어리 선생이 학교에서 문제는 없었니?
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:14	I don't know.
		몰라요 
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	I mean, he had a couple
		other projects like me.
		나 같은 프로젝트를 몇개 하긴 했어요 
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	I guess one of them
		could have gone wrong.
		그중 하나가 잘못됐던 것 같아요 
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	"Projects"?
		프로젝트?
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	You know... kids he was
		trying to help.
		개인적으로 도와주던 애들이요 
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	You got any names?
		이름은 몰라? 
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:28	He tried to keep that stuff
		pretty private.
		개인적으로 관리해서...
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:32	But I heard him... arguing
		on the phone with someone.
		하지만 전화로 다투는 건 들었어요 
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	Martin.
		마틴이라고
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Thanks.
		You've been very helpful.
		고마워, 많은 도움이 됐어 
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	L-let me know if I can
		do anything else.
		제가 할 수 있는 일이 또 있으면
		말씀하세요 
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:44	I want to help...
		for Mr. McTierney.
		맥티어리 선생님.. 돕고 싶어요 
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	If you want to help,
		you should do what he wanted.
		정 돕고 싶거든 선생님 충고대로 살아 
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	Go back to school.
		학교로 돌아가 
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:58	 
		 
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:10	Mr. Loveland.
		You got a minute?
		러브랜드 선생님, 시간 좀 있으세요?
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	Of course.
		물론이죠
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	Come in. Yeah. A-anything
		I can do to help.
		들어오세요, 뭐든 도와드리죠 
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	Well, in that case, why did you
		punch Mr. McTierney?
		그러시다면야, 맥티어리 선생을 왜 쳤습니까? 
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:23	How did you know that?
		그걸 어떻게? 
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	Oh.
		Well, I-I didn't,
		사실 몰랐는데요 
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	but you just told me.
		방금 시인하셨네요 
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	Also, drunk people
		aren't really known
		술 취한 사람들은 
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	for their impulse control.
		가끔 자기 통제가 안되잖아요 
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:33	Hey. Perfectly
		understandable.
		이해는 가고도 남습니다 
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	You're working with
		overachieving children all day.
		알파걸 알파보이에 매일 시달릴텐데 
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	Who wouldn't want
		to take the edge off? Huh?
		사람이 숨은 쉬고 살아야죠, 안그래요? 
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	Look. I know what you
		must be thinking,
		어떻게 생각하시는진 알겠는데 
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	but I had eight years sober.
		하지만 전 8년간 금주한적 있습니다 
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	And... my wife left me,
		그런데 아내가 떠나고 
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	and w-we got a new principal,
		and, well, I started thinking
		새 교장이 들어오니 
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	that a drink
		might be a good idea, and...
		약간 술을 마시는게 좋겠다 싶고 
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	about a month ago, I, uh...
		 tested that theory.
		한달 정도 그렇게 해봤죠 
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Mmm. How'd that go?
		그래서요? 
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	Okay. For a while.
		그래서 한동안은
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Then I started drinking
		before work,
		출근 전에 술을 마셨죠 
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	and I realized that
		I was out of control.
		그러다 자제가 안된다는 걸 느꼈습니다 
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	You confided in McTierney.
		맥티어리 선생에게 털어놨군요 
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	I thought I could trust him.
		I was wrong.
		믿을 수 있는 사람인줄 알았는데 
		아니었어요
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	He told the principal.
		교장에게 말했군요 
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	Yeah.
		네 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	He screwed me--royally.
		제 신세를 완전 망쳐놨지요 
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	Doesn't seem like something
		McTierney would do.
		맥티어리 선생이 했을법한 일이 아닌데 
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	I know. But when I asked Snyder
		for some time off,
		알아요, 하지만 교장한테 휴가계를 내자 
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	he knew about the drinking.
		교장이 내 음주사실을 알더란 말입니다 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	He couldn't fire me for it,
		but he could make my life hell.
		그걸로 날 자를수야 없지만
		날 괴롭힐수는 있었어요 
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:32	Okay.
		알겠습니다 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:36	Uh, wh-wh-where were you
		맥티어리 선생에게 
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	when you, uh, uh, told
		McTierney you relapsed?
		술버릇이 도졌다고 어디서 말했습니까? 
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	W-we were in the men's room.
		남자 화장실이요 
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	Was there anyone else there?
		누군가 듣는 사람은 없었나요? 
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	You think I'd be talking
		about that kind of stuff
		그런 얘기를 
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	if there were?
		- No, of course not.
		- 누구 있는데서 했을라구요?
		- 물론 아니겠죠 
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	Thank you.
		고맙습니다 
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:56	- I take it no baby yet.
		- No.
		- 애는 아직이네 
		- 응
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	Got anything
		to distract me?
		딴데 정신 팔만한게 없을까? 
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	Well, we finally got into
		McTierney's computer
		맥티어리 컴퓨터 암호를 풀어서 
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	and looked at his calendar.
		일정을 뽑아봤어 
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	He had an advisory meeting
		scheduled with a kid
		죽던날 밤에 
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	named Martin Klubock
		the night he died.
		마틴 클루복이란 학생과 면담이 잡혀 있었어 
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	- Really?
		- Yeah, but it's weird.
		- 정말?
		- 그런데 좀 이상해 
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	Martin's an "A" student,
		and he has no history
		마틴은 우등생이고 
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:11	of disciplinary action
		at school.
		학교에서 징계받은 적도 없어 
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	So why was he one of
		Mr. McTierney's projects?
		그런데 왜 맥티어리가 개인적으로
		돌봤을까? 
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	Well... I looked
		into his attendance records.
		출석 기록을 봤는데 
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	He's been out sick
		a bunch of times this year.
		올해 몇번이나 병가를 냈어 
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	And there was a trip
		to the emergency room--
		응급실로 실려간 적도 있고 
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	a broken rib
		and some stitches.
		갈비뼈가 부러지거나 꿰맨 적도 있어 
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	You think it's
		some kind of abuse?
		학대 가능성 얘기야? 
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	Could be, although his folks
		don't have a record.
		어쩌면. 설령 기록으론 없어도 
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	Anyway, he called in sick
		to school today.
		아무튼 오늘도 병가냈어 
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	Yeah. Cho and I will
		check it out. Gladly.
		선배랑 당장 가볼게 
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	That guilty creatures
		sitting in a play
		죄 지은 인간들이 연극을 보고 있을때 
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	have, by the--
		the cunning of the scene,
		그 극적인 표현이 너무나 교묘하여 
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	so struck to the soul
		영혼을 때림에 
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	that presently...
		그들이 즉각
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:42	they have proclaimed
		their malefactions,
		죄상을 
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	their shortcomings.
		공표한다 했었다 
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	Mind if I borrow
		some of this? Thank you.
		이것 좀 빌려도 되죠? 감사합니다 
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	For murder,
		though it have no tongue,
		왜냐하면 살인은 혀는 없어도 
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	will speak with most...
		magnificent organ.
		가장 기적 같은 수단으로 
		말을 할 것이기 때문에 
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	I'll have these players
		play something
		배우들에게 아버님의 살해와 
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	like the murder of my father
		before mine uncle.
		엇비슷한 연극을 삼촌 앞에서 시켜야지 
00:21:05

00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:26	Agent Lisbon,
		could I ask that we...
		리스본 요원님, 
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:29	keep this discreet?
		이걸 좀 비밀로 해주시면? 
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:30	No.
		싫어요 
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:35	Martin...
		마틴
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:37	you've been manufacturing
		Ecstasy,
		넌 엑스터시를 제조하고 있었어 
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	a schedule I narcotic.
		일급 마약이지 
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:43	You're 16 years old.
		넌 16살이야 
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	You can be tried
		as an adult,
		성인으로 법정에 설 수도 있고 
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	or you can be tried
		as a minor.
		미성년자로 법정에 설 수도 있어 
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	Believe me, you don't want
		to be tried as an adult.
		전자는 하기 싫을거다, 내 말 믿어 
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:52	You lied about meeting
		Mr. McTierney the night he died.
		맥티어리 선생님을 만나지 않았다고
		거짓말을 했지 
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:56	Okay. I met him.
		그래요, 만났어요 
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	And he confiscated
		your pills?
		네 약을 압수했고? 
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	That's why we found
		the drugs on him, right?
		그래서 맥티어리 선생 차에서
		약이 발견된거지? 
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:01	Yeah. But he didn't know
		I was making them. I swear.
		네, 하지만 제가 만드는지는 몰랐어요 
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:05	I told him I found the pills,
		저도 어디서 구했다고 했고 
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:07	and he believed me.
		제 말을 믿어줬어요 
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:08	What about your parents?
		They must have known
		부모님은 아셔? 
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	that there was
		a drug lab in their basement.
		지하실에 마약 공장이 있는데 
00:29:12	 
		 
00:29:12	Uh, they had no idea
		about the drugs.
		전혀 모르세요 
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	I told them it was for
		my science fair project.
		과학 전시회 프로젝트라고 말했거든요 
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	Okay.
		그래 
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:18	So why were you meeting
		Mr. McTierney?
		맥티어리 선생과는 왜 만났지? 
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:22	I had been having
		some... @@/trouble,@@\ and...
		저한테 귀찮은 일이 좀 있어서 
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	He was trying to help me.
		도와주려고 하셨어요 
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:30	Something to do with your,
		uh, trip to the emergency room?
		네가 응급실로 실려간거랑
		관련있는 얘기야?
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:33	Yeah.
		네 
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:37	Martin...
		마틴
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:43	are you getting abused
		at home?
		부모님이 학대하시니? 
00:29:45	 
		 
00:29:45	No. No way.
		전혀요 
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	My parents aren't around
		enough to abuse me.
		학대할만큼 저랑 자주 있지도 않아요 
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	So you're getting bullied
		at school?
		그럼 학교에서 괴롭힘 당하니?
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:53	Not really.
		딱히... 
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	I mean, kids can be morons,
		but... it's not that bad.
		애들이 가끔 병신같긴 해도
		그렇게 나쁜 애들은 아니에요 
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	I went to high school.
		나도 고등학교 나왔다 
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	They eat kids
		like you for breakfast.
		너 같은 애들은 아침 식사 삼아
		씹어먹을 수 있는 애들이야 
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	That's what Mr. McTierney
		was helping you with, right?
		그래서 맥티어리 선생이 널
		도와주려 한거지? 
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:08	Whatever.
		그렇다쳐요 
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	He tried,
		but what was he gonna do?
		시도는 했지만 그래서 어쩌라구요?
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	He couldn't be there
		24/7.
		하루 종일 절 밀착마크 할 순 없잖아요 
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	And what kind of wuss
		그리고 선생이 돌봐준다고 
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	needs a teacher
		to protect him, anyways?
		쭐래쭐래 쫓아다니는게 진짜 쪼다죠 
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	It just made things worse.
		상황만 나빠졌어요 
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	So you decided
		to become a drug dealer.
		그래서 약장수가 되려 한거구나 
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:23	I just wanted to be popular.
		인기를 얻고 싶었어요 
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	I thought if I became
		the cool drug guy,
		마약 공급책이 되면 
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	then everything
		would be different.
		유명세를 타고 모든게 바뀔 것 같았어요 
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	I wasn't even
		gonna sell the "E,"
		엑스터시만 파는게 아니라 
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:30	just give it away.
		신분이 바뀌는거죠 
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:32	I know that's crazy,
		but...
		헛소리라는 걸 알지만
00:30:35	 
		 
00:30:35	I would do anything.
		뭐든지 해야 했어요 
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:39	You know what?
		그거 아니? 
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	I got my ass kicked
		in high school.
		나도 고등학교에서 괴롭힘 당했다 
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	- Yeah, right.
		- No, seriously.
		- 아 그러세요 
		- 아니, 진담이야.
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:44	I was 5'4"
		till my senior year.
		2학년까지 키가 165밖에 안됐어 
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	Then I grew a foot.
		Things change.
		하지만 키가 자라니까 모든게 달라졌어 
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	That would be so awesome.
		짱 좋았겠네요 
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	Wait a second.
		잠깐만
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	Hey. What's up?
		네, 왜요?
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	Your--your what broke?
		뭐가 터져요?
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	Oh! Oh, oh! Uh, yeah, yeah.
		Um, I'm on my way.
		오, 이런! 네, 가요, 지금 가요 
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:02	Uh, don't move!
		넌 여기서 꼼짝마!
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:11	Hey.
		Hey.
		여
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	- Everything okay?
		- Yeah. Her water broke.
		- 괜찮은거야?
		- 양수가 터졌대요 
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	- That's a good thing, isn't it?
		- Yeah. It's, uh... it's happening.
		- 그러면 좋은거지, 아닌가?
		- 그냥...터진거죠 
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	- Can you tell Lisbon?
		- Yeah, I got you covered.
		- 반장님한테 말해줄래요?
		- 네 일은 내가 알아서 할게 
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	Thank you.
		고마워요 
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	Good luck.
		행운을 빈다 
00:31:21

		worth of footage.
		우리 60시간 분량을 들여다보고 있어요 
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	I think it's a dead end.
		이걸론 답이 없는 것 같아요
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	Patience, Grasshopper.
		인내심을 가지게, 학생
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	I am being patient.

		"bigify" it?
		막 크게 되고 그러는거? 
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	I can do a digital zoom.
		디지털줌 말이죠 
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	Good.
		그래
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:55	- You know that kid?
		- It's Billy, our Hamlet.

		- 햄릿 역의 빌리야 
00:31:59	 
		 
00:31:59	Well, that's interesting.
		이거 재밌네 
00:32:01	 
		 
00:32:02	That's--well, that's

00:32:17

		Let's get your jacket on.
		그거 안됐네, 얼른 옷 입어 
00:32:19

00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	Back to school.
