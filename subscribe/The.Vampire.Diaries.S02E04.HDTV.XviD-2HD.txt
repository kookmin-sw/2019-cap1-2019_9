00:00:00	Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	For over a century I have lived in secret.
		 
		한 세기를 걸쳐
00:00:03	Until now.
		 
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	I know the risk, but I have to know her.
		위험한 걸 알지만
		그녀를 알아야 한다
00:00:06	What are you?
		 
		정체가 뭐니?
00:00:07	I'm a vampire.
		 
		뱀파이어야
00:00:08	You must be Ms. Pierce.
		 
		피어스 양이군요
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	Please. Call me Katherine.
		캐더린으로 불러주세요
00:00:11	I was never in love with you, Katherine.
		 
		널 사랑한 적 없었어
00:00:13	So none of my feelings were real.
		 
		내 감정은 모두 진심이 아녔지
00:00:14	Believe what you want, Stefan.
		 
		원하는 대로 믿으셔
00:00:16	But I know the truth.
		 
		진실을 아니까
00:00:17	So, the black sheep returns.
		 
		검은 양이 돌아오셨군
00:00:19	Tyler?
		 
		타일러?
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Who's the guy with Carol?
		캐롤과 같이 있는
		남자는 누구죠?
00:00:20	Mason Lockwood.
		 
		메이슨 락우드
00:00:22	You know where I can find any family artifact stuff?
		 
		가족 유품은
		어디서 찾아야 하니?
00:00:24	I'm just lookin' for this old piece of my mom's.
		 
		어머니 물건을 찾고 있거든
00:00:26	It's a moonstone.
		 
		월장석이야
00:00:27	I think the Lockwoods have a family secret.
		 
		락우드 집안에
		비밀이 있는것 같아
00:00:28	They're not vampires. They're something else.
		 
		뱀파이이가 아냐
		뭔가 다른 존재지
00:00:31	- The lycanthrope. - Werewolves?
		 
		- 이리들
		- 늑대인간요?
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:34	It was you.
		삼촌이었구나
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:36	I've had her blood.
		내 피를 줬어
		캐더린이 죽인게 확실하고
00:00:37	 
		내 피를 줬어
		캐더린이 죽인게 확실하고
00:00:37	Katherine obviously killed her.
		내 피를 줬어
		캐더린이 죽인게 확실하고
00:00:38	"A" plus "B" equals...
		 
		A랑 B를 더하면..
00:00:40	I'm starving.
		 
		배고파 죽겠다고
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:44	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:00:45	Don't be frightened.
		 
		겁먹지 마
00:00:46	We're going to have so much fun together.
		 
		둘이 같이
		정말 재미있을테니까
00:00:48	 
		 
00:00:50	Look who found his dancing shoes.
		댄스화를 드디어 찾았군요
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:53	Uh! No touching, Mr. Salvatore. Those are the rules.
		닿으면 안되요. 살바토어군
		그게 법칙이라구요
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:58	I thought you didn't believe in rules.
		법칙같은 건
		안 믿는 줄 알았는데
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:02	My brother's still upset that you chose me to escort you.
		형은 아직도 날 파트너로
		택했단 사실에 화났어요
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:06	Well, Damon needs to concede
		동생이 춤을 더 잘 춘다는걸
		인정할 때도 됐는데
00:01:07	that his younger brother is a better dancer.
		동생이 춤을 더 잘 춘다는걸
		인정할 때도 됐는데
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:12	Oh, looks like he found someone to occupy his time.
		다른 파트너를 찾았나 본데요
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:24	Elena...
		엘레나..
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:25	Stefan, don't.
		스테판, 가지 마요
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:33	Elena!
		엘레나!
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:49	It's your turn.
		네 차례야
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:53	Be prepared to lose.
		질 준비해라
00:01:56	 
		 
00:02:02	It hurts, doesn't it?
		가슴이 찢어지지?
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:07	Now you know how I feel.
		내 심정을 알겠어?
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:11	Don't fight it, Stefan. You loved me once.
		부인하려 하지 마
		넌 한때 날 사랑했어
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:15	You can love me again.
		날 다시 사랑할 수도 있다구
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:21	I love you, Stefan.
		사랑해, 스테판
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:23	We'll be together again.
		우린 다시 하나가 될거야
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:26	I promise.
		약속해

00:02:44	Yes. Bad dream.
		악몽 꿨구나
00:02:46	 
		 
00:02:47	Go back to sleep.
		다시 자
00:02:48	 
		 
00:03:00	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	You have to admit I am getting better at this.

00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:08	It was easy to get inside of your head.
		네 머릿속에 들어가는건
		참 쉽더군
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	Have you completely forsaken your nature?
		네 본성을 완전 잊은거야?
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:16	Are we really going to do this again?
		또 이럴거야?
00:03:18	We both know I could rip you to shreds
		 
		널 갈가리 찢는 동시에
00:03:20	and do my nails at the same time.
		 
		매니큐어도 바를 능력이 되는거
		너도 잘 알잖아
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:24	What do you want?
		뭘 원하는 거야?
00:03:25	I wanted to see you.
		 
		널 보고 싶었어
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	I've missed you, Stefan.
		그리웠어, 스테판
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:28	Indulge me for a little while, please?
		날 만족시켜 줄 수 없니?
00:03:30	Why are you back in town?
		 
		왜 돌아온거야?
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:33	3 reasons.
		세가지 이유 때문에
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	You, you, and you.
		너랑 너. 그리고 너
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:39	See, I can't quite get that down.
		대답을 못하겠다
00:03:40	It just kind of--ahem-- gets stuck in my throat.
		 
		자꾸 목에 뭐가 걸리네
00:03:43	You know, it's the truth.
		 
		너도 진실을 알잖아
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:46	Deep down inside that gorgeous body of yours
		네 섹시한 몸 안
		마음속 깊이
00:03:48	is the Stefan that fell in love with me, too.
		 
		나와 사랑에 빠진
		스테판이 있을거야
00:03:51	 
		 
00:04:02	What do you want?
		원하는게 뭐죠?
00:04:03	So this is where you spend your time
		 
		사람들 뒤통수 치지 않을 때는
00:04:05	when you're not stabbing people in the back.
		 
		여기서 시간을 보내니?
00:04:07	I tricked you into telling me the truth.
		 
		사실을 말하게끔
		속였던것 뿐인데
00:04:10	That's not stabbing you in the back.
		 
		뒷통수 친게 아니죠
00:04:11	That's using your own tactics against you.
		 
		당신 꾀에 당신이 넘어간 거죠
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:14	Where are you going?
		어디 가?
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	I made myself clear, Damon.
		확실히 보여드렸는데
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:17	I want nothing to do with you.
		당신과는 아무 것도
		하고 싶지 않다고
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:19	Ok. See you at Jenna's barbecue.
		바베큐 파티때
		너희 집에서 보자꾸나
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:24	How did you know about Jenna's barbecue?
		이모가 여는 바베큐 파티를
		어떻게 알죠?
00:04:27	It was my idea.
		 
		내 아이디어였어
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:29	Jenna went to high school with Mason Lockwood.
		제나는 메이슨 락우드와
		같은 고등학교 출신이거든
00:04:31	So I figured a social gathering would be a good way
		 
		그래서 모임을 갖는게
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	to get to know the guy.
		그 남자를 알아내는
		좋은 방법 같다 싶었지
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	So, I told Rick to tell Jenna...
		릭한테 부탁했지
		제나한테 말해서..
00:04:37	Does Jenna know that you're going to be there?
		 
		이모도 당신이 가는거 알아요?
00:04:39	Because she's not exactly a fan of yours.
		 
		별로 좋아하지 않는데
00:04:41	Thank you.
		 
		고마워요
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	I'm hoping this peach cobbler will pave the way.
		복숭아 파이로
		맘이 바뀌면 좋겠다
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:47	What are you up to?
		무슨 속셈이죠?
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:51	I'm gonna go put some silver into Mason Lockwood
		메이슨 락우드한테
		은을 먹여서
00:04:53	and prove he's a werewolf.
		 
		늑대인간임을 밝혀낼거야
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:55	See you at the barbecue.
		바베큐 때 봐요
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:59	Hey, Mason, you got a second?
		삼촌, 잠깐 시간 돼?
00:05:00	Nah, man, barbecue at Jenna Sommer's house.
		 
		아니, 제나 소머스네서
		바베큐 파티를 해서
00:05:01	Come on, give me 2 minutes. All right?
		 
		2분만 있다 가라
00:05:03	You can't keep dodging me. I'm freaking out over here.
		 
		계속 날 피하고 있잖아
		정말 충격 먹었다구
00:05:06	Tyler, what do you want me to say, man?
		 
		타일러, 뭐라고 말하길 바라는대?
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	Yes, I turned into a wolf.
		그래, 나 늑대로 변했다
00:05:11	No, it's not gonna happen to you.
		 
		아니, 넌 그렇게 안될거야
00:05:12	How do you know that?
		 
		어떻게 알아?
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:14	Because you're not gonna trigger the curse.
		넌 저주에 걸리지 않았으니까
00:05:16	Your dad didn't know anything about any of this.
		 
		네 아버지는 하나도 몰랐어
00:05:18	Neither did I till it happened to me.
		 
		나도 변하기 전까진 몰랐지
00:05:19	How does it get triggered?
		 
		어떻게 그 저주에 걸리는거야?
00:05:20	Ignorance is bliss. Trust me.
		 
		모르는게 약이야
		날 믿어보렴
00:05:22	You blow back into town with some supernatural family secret
		 
		불가사의한 집안 비밀을 가지고
		동네에 나타나셨으면서
00:05:25	and you expect me not to ask questions?
		 
		내 질문을 기대 안했던거야?
00:05:27	I can't say anything more. I'm sorry, Tyler.
		 
		더 말해줄 수가 없다
		미안하다, 타일러
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:30	It's just better for you if I don't.
		모르는 게 나아
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:39	You ever find that moonstone?
		월장석은 찾았어?
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:42	Do you know where it is?
		어디 있는지 아니?
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:44	What's so special about it?
		특별한 이유라도 있어?
00:05:45	I told you. It was my mom's.
		 
		말했지. 어머니 꺼였다고
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	It's sentimental.
		추억이 서린 물건이라
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:50	Look, don't worry about it.
		걱정하지 마
00:05:52	Forget I even brought it up, all right.
		 
		말 꺼낸 것도 신경쓰지 마
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:56	See ya later.
		나중에 보자
00:05:57	 
		 
00:06:08	You shouldn't read someone's journal.
		남의 일기를 보면 안되지
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:11	I know. I'm sorry.
		알아. 미안
00:06:13	It was just too tempting, all your inner thoughts and feelings,
		 
		너무 궁금하더라고
		네 속마음과 생각들이
00:06:17	laying there on your desk for me to read.
		 
		책상에 딱 읽으라고
		올려져 있으니
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:23	Damon's private stock.
		데이먼의 개인 서재야
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:27	That's right! You don't do human.
		맞다. 너 인간하고 안 잔다며
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	I read that.
		그것도 읽었어
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:33	I also read about your recent werewolf sighting.
		네가 최근에
		늑대인간을 본것도
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	That must have come as a surprise.
		정말 놀랐겠어
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	What do you know about werewolves?
		아는거 있어?
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:41	I know not to pet one.
		애완견 삼기 힘들단건 알지
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:44	Their bite kills, Stefan.
		물리면 죽으니까
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	It's best to stay clear of them during a full moon.
		보름달이 뜨면
		피해있는게 상책이야
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:49	And how do you know this?
		어떻게 알아?
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	Who do you think was responsible
		1864년에 이 마을의
		뱀파이어가 몰살된게
00:06:53	for ridding this town of vampires in 1864?
		 
		누구 탓일까?
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	The founding families.
		설립자 가족
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:58	Spearheaded by?
		선동자는?
00:06:59	 
		 
00:07:03	The Lockwoods.
		락우드가
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:05	You remember the Founder's Ball, don't you?
		설립자 무도회 기억나?
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:08	The one that you were dreaming about?
		네가 꿈꾸던 거 말야?
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:12	I was your escort.
		내가 네 파트너였지
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:14	That was before you and Damon knew about my little secret.
		너나 데이먼과
		내 비밀을 몰랐던 때지
00:07:17	Everyone, will you please join me in raising your glasses
		 
		여러분 술잔을 들고
00:07:20	to my good friend George Lockwood.
		 
		제 친구 조지 락우드를
		축하해 주십시요
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:24	George, thank you for so bravely defending the south.
		조지, 남부지방을 지키려
		용감히 싸워주셔서 고맙습니다
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	My honor, Mr. Salvatore.
		영광입니다, 살바토어군
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	After all, someone had to do it.
		누군가는 해야 되는 일이었잖소
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:38	May I have a word, Miss Katherine?
		잠시 말씀 좀 나눌 수 있을까요?
00:07:39	Grab a glass, Henry. It's a celebration.
		 
		한 잔 들어요. 축하할겸
00:07:41	Please, Miss Katherine.
		 
		제발요, 캐더린 양
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:48	I looked into those attacks from the other night.
		지난 밤 습격을
		자세히 확인해 봤습니다
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:50	It wasn't vampires.
		뱀파이어가 아녔어요
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:53	That's good news, Henry.
		좋은 소식이군
00:07:54	That means we have nothing to worry about.
		 
		걱정할 필요 없단 거잖아
00:07:55	I'm afraid you don't understand.
		 
		이해를 못하는군요
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	Those folks were torn apart in ways I've never seen before.
		본 적 없는 형태로
		갈갈이 찢어져 있었습니다
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:04	Then...
		그럼..
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:06	it won't be long before the founders draw up an investigation.
		곧 의회 일원들이
		수사를 시작할 겁니다
00:08:08	We'll leave town immediately. I'll tell the others.
		 
		마을을 떠나야 해요
		다른 이들에게도 말했습니다
00:08:11	Relax, Henry.
		 
		진정해, 헨리
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	This is town is our home,
		이 마을은 우리 고향이야
00:08:14	and the vampires are my family.
		 
		뱀파이어들은 내 가족이고
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:17	I won't let anything happen to us.
		아무 일 생기지 않게 할게
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:23	From the moment I met George,
		조지를 만난 순간부터
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	I knew he'd be a problem.
		골칫덩이가 될 걸 알았어
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:29	So, you're saying that all the Lockwoods are werewolves?
		락우드 집안 사람들이
		다 늑대인간이란 거야?
00:08:33	The werewolf gene runs in the Lockwood family.
		 
		유전자가 락우드 가에
		돈다는 거지
00:08:36	Not that they're all wolves.
		 
		다 늑대인간이란 소리는 아니고
00:08:37	How many other werewolves are out there?
		 
		얼마나 있는데?
00:08:38	I mean, is it just... limited to the Lockwoods?
		 
		그러니까.. 락우드가 사람으로만
		제한되는 거야?
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	No. There are others. Not many.
		아니. 다른 가족들도 있지만
		많지는 않지
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:46	They're practically extinct.
		거의 멸종이야
00:08:47	They mainly exist now in books and really bad movies.
		 
		이젠 소설이나
		재미 없는 영화에 나오지
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:55	My turn to ask a question.
		내가 질문할 차례
00:08:57	 
		 
00:09:01	Why did you keep this picture?
		왜 이 사진을 갖고 있지?
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:08	Why not burn it? Tear it up?
		왜 안 태웠어?
		찢어 버리지 않은거야?
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:12	You wanna know why I came back?
		왜 돌아왔는지 알고 싶어?
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	Well, I have a better question.
		더 좋은 질문이 있어
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	Why did you?
		넌 왜 돌아 온거니?
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	For Elena?
		엘레나를 위해?
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:20	No.
		아니
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:22	You came back here to fall
		네가 이 마을에 돌아온 이유는
00:09:23	in love with me all over again, didn't you?
		 
		나랑 다시 사랑에
		빠지려는 거였지?
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:41	What is it about you...
		네가 대체 뭐길래..
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:48	that makes me still care?
		아직도 신경이 쓰이는 걸까?
00:09:49	 
		 
00:10:37	Now, where were we?
		어디까지 했더라?
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:41	That's right.
		그래
00:10:42	You were gonna tell me why
		 
		넌 방금 나한테
00:10:43	you came back to Mystic Falls, weren't you?
		 
		미스틱 폴즈로 돌아온 이유를
		얘기하던 참이었지?
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	You didn't have to do this.
		이럴 필요 없잖아
00:10:47	Answer the question.
		 
		질문에 답하기나 해
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:49	I came back for you.
		너 때문에 돌아왔어
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:54	We're gonna play by my rules now.
		게임은 내 규율대로 하지
00:10:56	 
		 
00:11:07	What are you doing?
		뭐 하는 거야?
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:14	Answer the question.
		질문에 답해
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:17	You're going to torture me now?
		날 고문하겠단 거야?
00:11:19	I'm going to do whatever
		 
		난 뭐든지 해서
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	it takes to get you to tell me the truth.
		네가 진실을 불게 할거야
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:25	Later that night at the Founder's Ball--
		그 이후 설립자 무도회 때..
00:11:27	I don't wanna hear anymore stories about the past.
		 
		난 과거 얘기 더 듣고 싶지 않아
00:11:30	Yes, you do, Stefan.
		 
		아니, 들어야 해
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	That's exactly what you want to hear.
		네가 듣고 싶은 얘기니까
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:37	She's all alone.
		혼자 계시군요
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:40	Does this mean I can finally have you all to myself?
		이제 저와 단둘이 있을
		기회가 생긴건가요?
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:43	Your father's outdone himself.
		아버님이 의외로 잘 꾸미셨네요
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	Knowing father, he'll want to
		아버지를 잘 알아요
00:11:47	throw a Founders Party every year.
		 
		설립자 무도회는
		매년 열고 싶어할 걸요
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:51	I must admit I am rather
		솔직히 말하죠
00:11:54	surprised that you'd come looking for me.
		 
		당신이 날 찾아 왔다니
		놀랐다는 걸
00:11:56	 
		 
00:11:56	Because you're the rope in the Salvatore brother's tug-of-war?
		살바토어 형제의
		싸움의 주인공이라서요?
00:11:59	No, because I'm a vampire
		 
		아뇨, 내가 뱀파이어라 말이죠
00:12:01	who could kill you in your sleep.
		 
		당신이 잘 때
		죽일 수도 있구요
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:05	I beg your pardon?
		뭐라구요?
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:07	Relax, george.
		진정해요, 조지
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:09	I know you know my secret.
		내 비밀을 아는거 아니까
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	This conversation is over.
		대화는 그만 하죠
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:14	And I know your secret, too.
		난 당신 비밀도 잘 알아요
00:12:16	And I know that you're extra strong. Only not as strong.
		 
		나보다 더 힘이 쎄다는 걸
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:26	How do you know who I am?
		내 정체를 어떻게 아시오?
00:12:27	You think that I would
		 
		적이 누군지 모르고
		이 마을에 정착할 거라 믿었나요?
00:12:28	 
		 
		적이 누군지 모르고
		이 마을에 정착할 거라 믿었나요?
00:12:28	settle into a town without knowing my enemies?
		 
		적이 누군지 모르고
		이 마을에 정착할 거라 믿었나요?
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:33	What do you want?
		원하는게 뭐요?
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:37	What did he want?
		그가 원하는게 뭐였어?
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:52	Thanks for letting me invite Caroline.
		캐롤라인 초대하게 해줘서 고마워
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	She could use a day of distraction.
		정신을 돌릴 시간이 필요하거든
00:12:56	She's not the plus one I'm worried about.
		 
		내가 걱정하는 사람은
		캐롤라인이 아냐
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	Why is Damon coming?
		데이먼은 왜 오는거라고?
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	Because Alaric is a pity-taker.
		알라릭이 동정심이 많아서
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	Come on, Jenna. Be nice.
		제발, 제나 이모
		친절하게 굴어
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:05	I'll be nice when Damon learns to keep his paws off you.
		데이먼이 너한테
		추근덕 안 대면 그럴게
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:10	Ahh, good news. Found the shot glasses.
		좋은 소식
		술잔을 찾았습니다
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:14	That would be my exit.
		그럼 난 가볼게요
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:16	You're here for 10 minutes and already I'm back
		온지 10분 만에
00:13:17	under the bleachers at the pep rally.
		 
		난 외야석 구경꾼이 되어 버리네
00:13:18	Just like old times, huh?
		 
		옛시절처럼 말이지?
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	Only I didn't swipe this bottle from my old man.
		하지만 아버지한테 훔친 술인걸
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:24	Oh, the expensive stuff. I like you already.
		비싼 술 아닌가요?
		벌써 맘에 드는군요
00:13:28	Just happy to be invited.
		 
		초대받아 기쁘군요
00:13:29	Thank Rick. This was his idea.
		 
		고마워요 릭
		이게 릭 아이디어였어
00:13:31	- Really? - Yeah. Well, you know.
		 
		- 정말요?
		- 네
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	I thought it'd be nice to
		제나의 옛친구들을 만나는게
00:13:33	meet some of Jenna's old high school friends.
		 
		좋을 것 같아서요
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:36	Dig up a little dirt.
		안좋은 과거도 좀 캐고
00:13:37	Oh, I've got dirt. I've got dirt.
		 
		제가 좀 알죠
00:13:39	I have no secrets. Only dirty shame.
		 
		나 비밀 없어요
		쪽팔리는 과거밖에
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	To dirty shame.
		쪽팔리는 과거를 위하여
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:45	Cheers.
		건배
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:49	Damon.
		데이먼
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	We were just doing shots. Let me get you a shot glass, buddy.
		한 잔씩 마시는 중인데
		잔 하나 갖다 드리죠
00:13:53	Here.
		 
		여기요
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:55	Use mine.
		내꺼 써요
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:59	She doesn't like me very much.
		날 별로 좋아하지 않는군
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:02	We haven't met. Mason Lockwood.
		초면이죠
		메이슨 락우드입니다
00:14:04	Oh, sure. Hey. Damon Salvatore.
		 
		네, 데이먼 살바토어에요
00:14:06	I know. I've heard great things about you.
		 
		알아요. 얘기 많이 들었습니다
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:10	Really? That's weird. 'cause I'm a dick.
		정말요? 이상하네요
		나 정말 못된 놈인데
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:14	Hey. I'm just checking in.
		확인 좀 하려고
00:14:17	Did you get my message about Jenna's barbecue?
		 
		제나 바베큐 파티에 대해
		내가 보낸 문자 받았어?
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:22	Call me when you can.
		되면 전화해 줘
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:24	Was that Stefan?
		스테판이야?
00:14:25	He hasn't called me back.
		 
		아직 전화를 안 줘
00:14:27	I'm trying to decide if I should be worried.
		 
		걱정해야 되나 싶어서
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	I'm sure he's fine.
		괜찮을 거야
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:31	God, I cannot stop eating.
		계속 먹게 된다
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:34	Stefan says it's a great way to sublimate the cravings.
		스테판이 그러길 욕구를
		승화시키는 좋은 방법이래
00:14:38	It's horrible.
		 
		끔찍하다구
00:14:39	Fighting the urge for blood every minute of every day.
		 
		매일 매 순간마다
		피를 향한 욕구를 싸워내는거
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	I know Stefan really hates that part of himself.
		스테판은 그런 면을
		정말 혐오할거야
00:14:47	Well, yeah. And he hates that you're a constant temptation.
		 
		그래. 네가 계속적으로
		자극이 되는 것도 싫대
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:52	He said that?
		스테판이 그랬어?
00:14:53	Hmm. The desire to rip out your jugular
		 
		너와 함께 있을 때마다
00:14:55	every time he's with you?
		 
		네 목을 뜯고 싶은 욕망?
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	Trust me, it's there.
		믿어봐, 다 있다구
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:59	It's why I had to break up with Matt.
		그래서 맷하고 해어져야 했지
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:05	Hey, food's ready. Come get it.
		다 준비 됐다
		와서 먹으렴
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:08	Finally. I am starving.
		배고파 죽겠다
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:15	We can sit here as long as you want.
		원하는 대로
		계속 여기 있자
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:18	And when you start to desiccate,
		네가 생기를 잃기 시작하면
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	there's a tomb with your name on it.
		네 이름 단 무덤있어
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:25	I've been doing all the talking. It's your turn.
		얘기는 계속 했으니
		니 차례야
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:29	Do you pretend to be human when you're with Elena?
		엘레나와 있을 때
		인간인 척 하니?
00:15:31	Is that the appeal?
		 
		그래서 좋은거야?
00:15:32	Actually, I don't pretend to be anything
		 
		사실, 난 엘레나와 있을때
		아무런 연기 안해
00:15:34	when I'm with her.
		 
		사실, 난 엘레나와 있을때
		아무런 연기 안해
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:36	That's the whole point.
		그래서 좋아하는 거지
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:38	I get to just be myself.
		나다워질 수 있어서
00:15:39	Does she know that you love me?
		 
		네가 날 사랑한단 것도 알아?
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:44	I don't.
		난 널 사랑 안 해
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:46	That's where you're wrong, Stefan.
		그래서 틀렸어
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:50	Don't you remember bringing me home that night?
		그 날 밤 날 집에
		데려다준 거 기억나?
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:56	Your family had taken me in.
		네 가족들이 날 들여줬지
00:15:58	I had a lovely time, Stefan.
		 
		정말 즐거웠어요
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	How long do you plan on staying in Mystic Falls?
		미스틱 폴즈에
		얼마나 더 머물 계획인가요?
00:16:02	As long as I'm wanted.
		 
		제가 원하는 만큼요
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	Your father has been very kind to give me shelter.
		당신 아버님이 고맙게도
		지낼 곳을 마련해주셔서
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	How could not?
		어찌 안 그랬겠어요?
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	Losing your family in the fire.
		화재로 가족을 잃었는데요
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	I'm grateful you made it out of Atlanta.
		애틀란타에서 여기까지 와줘
		정말 고마울 따름인걸요
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	So, I gather I'm wanted?
		내가 머물길 바란다는 건가요?
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:16	Very much so.
		그렇죠
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:21	I know we've only known each other for a short while.
		서로를 안지 얼마 안됐고
00:16:25	And I know I'm in competition for your affections.
		 
		당신의 사랑을 두고
		경쟁 중인거 압니다
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:30	But...
		하지만..
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:34	I've never met a woman quite like you.
		그대 같은 여자를
		만난 적 없소
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:39	I look at you and I see an angel.
		당신을 보면
		천사가 보여요
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:47	I touch your skin...
		당신을 만지면..
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:51	And my entire body ignites.
		온 몸이 흥분되죠
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:57	I kiss you and I know that I'm falling in love.
		당신과 키스하면
		사랑에 빠진걸 알아요
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:15	I am in love with you.
		당신을 사랑합니다
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:18	There's just so much you don't know about me, Stefan.
		당신은 아직 저에 대해
		모르는게 많아요, 스테판
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:21	More to learn and love.
		배워가면 되죠
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	I must say goodnight.
		작별인사 해야겠어요
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:26	I've upset you?
		내가 당황하게 했나요?
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	No.
		아뇨
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:30	You haven't upset me.
		당황하진 않았어요
00:17:31	You've just surprised me.
		 
		좀 놀랐을 뿐이죠
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:35	Till tomorrow.
		내일 봐요
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:46	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐하는 거에요?
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:49	I told you I would come.
		올 수도 있다고 말했잖소
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:52	Well, I'm tired. You should go.
		피곤해요. 가요
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	Did my little brother's confession overwhelm you?
		내 동생의 고백에
		당황한건가?
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:59	You shouldn't eavesdrop.
		엿듣지 마요
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:05	Is my love not enough?
		내 사랑이 부족한 거요?
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:08	I told you. I'm tired.
		말했죠. 피곤하다고
00:18:10	I wish to be alone tonight. Please leave.
		 
		혼자있고 싶어요
		제발 나가줘요
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:17	Good night, Katherine.
		잘 자요, 캐더린
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:33	Go ahead, Stefan.
		계속해, 스테판
00:18:34	Torture me, keep me captive,
		 
		날 고문하고
		가둬두고
00:18:37	drain me of blood until my body turns to dust.
		 
		재가 될 때까지
		내 피를 뽑아도
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	It'll never change the truth.
		진실은 변하지 않아
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:44	I never compelled your love.
		네 사랑을 조종하지 않았어
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:49	It was real. And so was mine.
		진심이었어
		내 사랑 역시도
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:57	- Dress! Ballerina! - Puppy! Puppy!
		- 드레스! 발레리나!
		- 강아지!
00:18:59	Puppy with a tutu.
		 
		발레복 입은 강아지!
00:19:01	- No. - Dog. Hound dog.
		 
		- 땡
		- 개. 사냥개
00:19:03	You ain't nothing but a hound dog!
		 
		에릭 클랩튼의
		'넌 사냥개에 지나지 않아'

00:19:07	Mason wins...again.
		메이슨이 또.. 맞췄군요
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	How is that a wolf?!
		어떻게 그게 늑대죠?
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:13	Aunt Jenna's getting tipsy.
		제나가 취하기 시작했네
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Will you stop playing her with alcohol?
		술 갖고 장난 그만칠래요?
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	I want her to like me.
		네 이모가 날 좋아해줬음 좋겠어
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:20	How's operation Lockwood?
		락우드 작전은요?
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	He's my new BFF.
		내 새로운 절친이 되었어
00:19:23	There you are.
		 
		저기 있었네
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:26	Isn't this fun?
		재미있지 않나요?
00:19:26	Yes. Thank you so much for inviting me.
		 
		네. 초대해줘서 고마워요
00:19:29	Did I have a choice?
		 
		선택은 내가 한게 아녔죠
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:31	I know what you must think about me.
		날 어떻게 생각하는지 알아요
00:19:32	No, you don't.
		 
		아뇨, 모를걸요
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	You've never dated you.
		당신은 당신과 사귀어본적 없잖아
		난 여러 당신을 사귀어 봤다구
00:19:36	I have dated many yous.
		당신은 당신과 사귀어본적 없잖아
		난 여러 당신을 사귀어 봤다구
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:38	Well, I'm a work in progress.
		배워나가고 있습니다
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:47	These are fancy.
		이거 참 멋지군요
00:19:48	Thanks. My mother's silver set.
		 
		고마워요. 어머니가 주신
		은수저 세트에요
00:19:51	 
		 
00:20:02	Hearing the truth after a century and a half of denial
		한세기 반동안 부정하다가
		진실을 들으니
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	must be overwhelming.
		참 충격적이겠어
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:07	It wasn't real. I remember you compelling me.
		내 마음은 진심이 아녔어
		날 조종한거 기억 나
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	Only after I showed you who I really was.
		내 정체를 보여준 바로 다음에만 그랬지
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	You were so scared of me.
		날 너무 두려워 했거든
00:20:14	I had to take away your fear.
		 
		네 두려움을 앗아가야만 했어
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:17	Well, whatever feelings I had back then...
		내가 그 때 가진 감정이 뭐였든
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:21	they've all turned to hate.
		다 증오로 뒤바뀌었어
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	Love, hate.
		사랑과 증오
00:20:25	Such a fine line.
		 
		구분이 참 어렵지?
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:28	I can wait.
		기다릴 수 있어
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:30	Anyway, George Lockwood was causing all sorts of trouble.
		그건 그렇고, 조지 락우드가
		모든 문제의 근원이었어
00:20:33	He used the vampires to cover up his own tracks.
		 
		자기 흔적을 감추려
		뱀파이어를 이용했지
00:20:38	He told the founding families about us.
		 
		설립자들에게
		우리 존재를 말했지
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	But he was willing to strike a deal.
		하지만 그는
		기꺼이 계약에 응했어
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:44	What kind of a deal?
		어떤 계약?
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:46	A deal to rid the town of vampires.
		마을의 뱀파이어를
		모조리 없애는 계약
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	I just spoke to Giuseppe Salvatore.
		방금 지세피 살바토어와
		얘기했습니다
00:20:50	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:20:51	The round-up happens tonight.
		오늘 밤에 마을 사람들을
		소집할겁니다
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	Good. Insist that they do a body count
		좋아요. 교회를 불태우기 전에
00:20:55	before they set the church is set ablaze.
		 
		명 수를 세라고 하세요
00:20:56	- I will. - 27 vampires.
		 
		- 그러죠
		- 뱀파이어 27명입니다
00:20:59	 
		 
00:21:00	Once the flames create chaos,
		불을 피울 때
		사람들이 소동을 피우면
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	crawl to the exit under the choir loft.
		성가대석 아래
		탈출구로 기어가요
00:21:05	I'll be there to set you free.
		 
		거기서 당신을
		탈출시켜 주겠소
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:07	Make sure you're not followed.
		뒤따라오는 자가 없는지
		꼭 확인하세요
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:10	I need everyone to believe that I perished in that fire.
		내가 불 속에서 죽었다고
		믿게 만들어야 하니까
00:21:13	You knew that they're going to burn the vampires in the church?
		 
		뱀파이어를 교회 안에서
		태워죽일걸 알고 있었던 거야?
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:19	I practically lit the match.
		불을 붙인 거나 다름 없지
00:21:20	They were your friends. They were your family.
		 
		네 친구들이었어
		가족들이었다고
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	You just sold them out?
		그냥 팔아넘긴 거야?
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:26	Without blinking.
		눈 하나 깜짝 않고 말이지
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:31	Mason.
		메이슨
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:34	Why don't you start us off.
		먼저 드시죠
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:40	Sure.
		물론요
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:50	What? I apologize. I'm an animal.
		왜요? 사과할게요
		동물처럼 먹는 거
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:57	So, Mason, you and Jenna never dated?
		메이슨, 제나랑
		사귄적 없어요?
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:01	She was always lost in Logan Fell-land.
		로건 펠에 빠져 살았죠
00:22:03	Oh, my first mistake.
		 
		내 처음 실수죠
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:06	Mason was a catch.
		메이슨은 괜찮은 남자였죠
00:22:07	He had girls lining up.
		 
		여자들이 줄을 섰으니까
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	Really?!
		정말요?
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:11	Huh. I pegged you for a lone wolf.
		외로운 늑대로 보였는데
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:15	I'm sure I wasn't half the lady killer you were.
		여자 낚는 건
		당신의 반도 못 따라갔죠
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:21	How about a toast?
		건배하는 게 어때요?
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:23	To new friends.
		새 친구들을 위하여
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:27	Cheers!
		건배!
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:32	Would I be the worst friend
		널 두고 스테판네 집에 가면
		못된 친구일까?
00:22:33	in the world if I abandoned you and went to Stefan's?
		널 두고 스테판네 집에 가면
		못된 친구일까?
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	You want to leave?
		나가고 싶니?
00:22:37	It's just that he hasn't gotten back to me.
		 
		아직 연락이 없어서
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	And I'm starting to get this bad feeling.
		감이 안좋아
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	I don't think that's a good idea, Elena.
		좋은 생각이 아냐
00:22:43	Damon's got it under control here.
		 
		데이먼이 다 처리할거야
00:22:45	Take it from me, there's nothing worse than a clingy girlfriend.
		 
		경험에서 하는 소린데
		매달리는 여친보다 심한건 없다구
00:22:48	I'm not being clingy. I'm just concerned.
		 
		매달리는 게 아냐
		그냥 걱정되서
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:51	You understand, right?
		이해하지?
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:53	How about I drive you?
		내가 운전하는게 어때?
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:55	Yeah. Ok. That'd be great. Thanks.
		좋아. 그럼 좋지
00:22:57	Yeah.
		 
		그래
00:22:58	 
		 
00:23:21	What did George get in return for giving you your freedom?
		네게 자유를 주는 댓가로
		조지는 뭘 받았어?
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:27	Something he wanted desperately.
		간절히 원하던 거
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	So you sent 26 of your friends
		26명의 친구를 죽인거야?
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:33	to their death just to fake your own?
		네 죽음을 속이려고?
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:38	No. You were running from something. What was it?
		아니. 뭔가 도망쳐야 하는
		이유가 있었구나, 그렇지?
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:42	Everyone has a past, Stefan.
		모두 과거가 있어, 스테판
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:45	Mine needed to stay far, far away.
		내 과거는
		도망쳐야만 하는 거였어
00:23:47	But thanks to you, my plan nearly failed
		 
		네 덕에, 내 계획이 시작 전에
		실패로 돌아갈 뻔 했지
00:23:50	 
		 
		네 덕에, 내 계획이 시작 전에
		실패로 돌아갈 뻔 했지
00:23:50	before it even began.
		 
		네 덕에, 내 계획이 시작 전에
		실패로 돌아갈 뻔 했지
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:52	Once George told me that the roundup was imminent,
		조지가 모집이 다 끝나간다고 전했을때
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:55	I made sure I could see you one last time.
		널 마지막으로 보려고 했었어
00:23:57	 
		 
00:24:00	- Vervain! - What?
		- 마편초에요!
		- 뭐라고요?
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:02	But your father used your love for me against you.
		하지만 아버지가 네 사랑을 이용했지
00:24:04	Katherine!
		 
		캐더린!
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:06	He poisoned your blood.
		네 피에 마편초를 넣었어
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:09	We don't have long.
		시간이 별로 없어
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:12	Then Damon, being Damon,
		그 때 데이먼은
		데이먼 답게
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:15	nearly ruined everything.
		다 망쳐버릴 뻔 했지
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:20	No!
		안 돼!
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:26	We came for you. We tried to save you.
		우린 널 위해 돌아갔어
		널 구해주려고
00:24:29	I didn't want to be saved.
		 
		날 구할 필요는 없었어
00:24:30	Then Damon and I died for nothing. For nothing!
		 
		그럼 데이먼하고 난
		헛되게 죽은거잖아!
00:24:32	No, Stefan. You died for love!
		 
		아니, 스테판
		사랑을 위해 죽은거지!
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:39	Jenna just brought out "Guitar hero."
		제나가 기타 히어로 게임 꺼냈어요
00:24:41	It might be time to mutiny.
		 
		어디 한번 대결해보죠
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:43	Well, I just I happen to like "Guitar hero."
		나도 기타 히어로 좋아하는데
00:24:45	So you, my friend, are barking up the wrong tree.
		 
		그러니 친구분
		헛다리 짚으셨군요
00:24:49	Ok, enough with the innuendos.
		 
		좋아요, 그만 빈정대구요
00:24:51	You win. You're hilarious.
		 
		당신 승이에요
		정말 재미있네요
00:24:52	Thank you.
		 
		고마워요
00:24:53	Come on, man,
		 
		이봐
00:24:54	you don't think I know what this barbecue is about?
		 
		바베큐 모임에 부른 이유를
		내가 모를 것 같아?
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:56	How do you know about me?
		나에 대해 뭘 알지?
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:59	Your brother was completely clueless.
		당신 형은 전혀 모르고 있었지
00:25:01	It doesn't matter. I'm not your enemy, Damon.
		 
		상관 없어
		난 당신 적이 아냐, 데이먼
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	You tried to kill my brother.
		내 동생을 죽이려고 했잖아
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:07	That was a mistake.
		실수였어
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	Really?
		그래?
00:25:09	There was confusion.
		 
		혼동했다고
00:25:10	I couldn't chain myself up in time.
		 
		제때 사슬을 묶지 못해서
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	I have no control once I shift.
		변하고 나면
		통제력을 잃어
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	What, no obedience school?
		복종 교육 같은건 안 받아?
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:16	I'm serious.
		심각하다고
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:18	Let's not spark some age-old feud that doesn't apply to us.
		우리랑은 상관 없는
		조상들의 숙원은 시작하지 말자고
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	You expect me to believe that
		지금 당신은
00:25:22	you're in Mystic Falls planting peace trees?
		 
		평화의 나무를 심으러 왔단 거야?
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:26	I lost my brother.
		난 우리 형을 잃었어
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:28	My nephew lost his father.
		내 조카는 아버지를 잃었고
00:25:29	I'm here for my family.
		 
		가족들을 위해 온거야
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:34	Let's be above this.
		이러지 말자고
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:57	Thanks for this. I appreciate it.
		고마워. 정말
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:00	Here we come... to the rescue.
		구출하러.. 갑시다
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	Why are you being so snippy?
		왜 이렇게
		퉁명스럽게 구니?
00:26:04	That's my own drama.
		 
		내 사적인 일들 때문에
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:07	I'm sure that you two will beat the odds.
		너희는 확률을 극복해내길 바라
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	Not that there's any study to pull odds from.
		확률을 따질만한
		연구는 찾을수 없지만
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	What is the ratio of success for vampire/human couplings?
		뱀파이어와 인간 커플의
		성공율이 얼마나 될까?
00:26:18	I'm guessing nil.
		 
		아예 없겠지
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:21	Ok, Caroline.
		알았어
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:23	Sorry.
		미안
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:32	I love this song.
		이 노래 좋다
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:36	What's playing?
		무슨 곡이죠?
00:26:37	Playing We Radiate Goldfrapp.
		 
		Goldfrapp의
		We Radiate
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:43	Oh... Crap.
		젠장
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:46	No takers for more drinks at the grill?
		그릴에서 2차 할 분은
		없는거에요?
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:49	It's like I'm with a bunch of adults here.
		늙은이들하고 있는 것 같네
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:52	I prefer the term role model.
		롤모델이란 표현이
		더 적절하지
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:55	Ok. Well, thanks for having me. It was awesome.
		초대해줘서 고마워
		정말 즐거웠어
00:26:58	 
		 
00:26:58	Alaric, catch that game next week?
		알라릭, 다음 주에
		경기 같이 볼래요?
00:27:01	Yeah. Looking forward to it.
		 
		네, 고대하죠
00:27:02	Hey, you know, I should probably head out, too.
		 
		나도 가봐야겠네요
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:08	Jenna...
		제나..
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:11	You are a wonderful hostess.
		정말 파티 준비
		잘하셨어요
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:14	And you are a terrible artist.
		당신은 그림 정말
		끔찍히 못 그리구요
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	Is that the only thing that makes me terrible?
		끔찍한 게
		그것밖에 없던가요?
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:21	Still deciding.
		아직 생각 중이죠
00:27:22	Good enough for me.
		 
		그 정도면 고맙죠
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:24	Alaric...
		알라릭..
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:27	Let's not catch that game next week.
		다음 주 경기는
		꼭 놓치지 말자구
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:34	Are you sure the tow's coming?
		견인차 오는거 확실해?
00:27:36	We've been waiting forever.
		 
		하루 종일 기다렸잖아
00:27:37	I know. It's weird.
		 
		알아. 이상하지
00:27:38	They said they'd be here by now.
		 
		지금쯤 여기 올거랬는데
00:27:40	 
		 
00:27:40	Yeah.
		그래
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:43	I'm just gonna call Jenna.
		이모한테 전화할래
00:27:44	No!
		 
		아니!
00:27:45	 
		 
00:27:45	Let me try the tow people again.
		견인 업체에 다시 연락하자
00:27:47	And I'll use my aggro voice.
		 
		화난 목소리 연기할게
00:27:49	We can just walk from here.
		 
		그냥 걸어가던가
00:27:50	I can't just leave my car.
		 
		차를 그냥 두고 갈 수 없어
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	We'll come back for it.
		나중에 돌아오자고
00:27:53	Just give me a minute, Elena.
		 
		잠깐 시간 좀 줘봐, 제나
00:27:55	Caroline, what part of
		 
		캐롤라인, 도대체
00:27:56	"I'm worried about Stefan" didn't sink in?
		 
		왜 걱정되는 마음을
		이해 못해주는거야?
00:27:58	What's the rush?
		 
		서두를게 뭐 있어?
00:27:59	 
		 
00:27:59	Why are you hurrying to get to a relationship that'll never work?
		잘 풀리지 않을 걸 알면서
		서두르는 이유가 뭔대?
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:03	Ok. Look, I know that you're upset over Matt,
		맷 때문에 화난거 알아
00:28:06	But will you stop projecting it onto me and Stefan, please?
		 
		하지만 나나 스테판한테
		투영시키지 말라고
00:28:09	I'm not projecting anything.
		 
		난 투영시키는 거 없어
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:12	You're human. He's a vampire.
		넌 인간이야
		걔는 뱀파이어고
00:28:14	You're going to be 70 and in diapers,
		 
		넌 70살을 먹고
		기저귀를 차게 되겠지만
00:28:16	And he's still gonna be smoking hot.
		 
		스테판은 그 때도 여전히
		멋진 모습일 거라고
00:28:18	And you will never have his children, Elena.
		 
		넌 스테판의 아이도 못 가질거야, 엘레나
00:28:21	And you are too maternal to not have children.
		 
		넌 모성애가 깊어서
		아이를 낳아야 한다구
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:24	Where is this coming from?
		갑자기 왜 이래?
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	I'm just trying to be your friend.
		친구답게 얘기하는 거야
00:28:27	Ok. Well, do me a favor and stop trying.
		 
		부탁인데 그만 해
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:32	There's the tow. I'm gonna walk.
		견인차 온다
		난 걸어갈래
00:28:33	No. Elena, don't--
		 
		엘레나, 가지 마
00:28:35	Aah. Caroline, you're hurting me.
		 
		캐롤라인, 아프잖아
00:28:37	Don't leave me alone.
		 
		나 혼자 두고 가지 마
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:41	What's wrong with you?
		대체 너 왜 그래?
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:43	Hey there. Someone call about a flat tire?
		안녕하세요
		타이어 펑크로 전화주셨죠?
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	She did.
		저쪽이요
00:28:48	 
		 
00:29:01	Damon.
		데이먼
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:03	What? More dog jokes?
		왜? 개 갖고 농담 더 하려고?
00:29:04	Nah. Those got old.
		 
		아니. 질렸어
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:17	You know...
		있지..
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:20	I think it was werewolves
		은에 대한 신화를 시작한게
		늑대인간인 줄 알았는데
00:29:22	who started this whole silver myth.
		은에 대한 신화를 시작한게
		늑대인간인 줄 알았는데
00:29:23	 
		 
00:29:24	Probably for moments like this.
		특별히 이런 순간에 말이겠지
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:28	Duly noted.
		그러게
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:32	I was really looking forward to last call.
		큰 일이 터지기만을
		고대 중이었지
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:41	Now you made an enemy.
		이제 정말 적을 만드셨어
00:29:43	 
		이제 정말 적을 만드셨어
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:50	So you going to tell me why you came back here?
		돌아온 이유 말해줄거야
00:29:52	Or were you just playing another game?
		 
		아님 또 다른 속셈이 있는거야?
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:54	Have you not heard a word that I've said?
		내가 한 말 하나도 못 들었어?
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:57	I've answered that question 5 times over now.
		다섯 번이나 대답했다고
00:30:00	All right. Good. Make it six.
		 
		좋아. 여섯 번째로 대답해 봐
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:04	I want what I want, Stefan.
		내가 원하는 게 뭔지 알아, 스테판
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	And I don't care what I have to do to get it.
		그걸 얻기 위해선
		무엇이든 할거야
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:09	My list of victims is a long one.
		내 희생자 리스트는
		아주 길거든
00:30:11	And I have no problem adding one more name to that list.
		 
		한 명 추가시키는 건
		문제도 아냐
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	Come on, Katherine.
		왜 이래
00:30:16	If you wanted Elena dead,
		 
		엘레나를 죽이고 싶었음
00:30:17	You would have done it by now.
		 
		훨씬 전에 죽였어야 했어
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:19	I still can.
		아직도 가능해
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:21	If I have to,
		그래야 한다면
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:23	I will snap her neck like a twig.
		나뭇가지처럼
		목을 꺾을테니
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	And you know it.
		너도 알잖아
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:39	Guess you don't hate me as much as you thought you did.
		생각만큼 날
		증오하진 않구나
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:44	I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
		엘레나를 만나지 마
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:47	If you don't remove her from your life,
		그녀를 떠나지 않으면
00:30:49	I will kill everyone that she loves while she watches,
		 
		엘레나 보는 앞에서
		사랑하는 사람들을 죽일거야
00:30:52	And then I will kill her while you watch.
		 
		그리고 네가 보는 앞에서
		엘레나를 죽일거고
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:57	Don't you ever think for one moment that I will not kill you.
		내가 널 죽일 수 있단거 잊지마
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:07	I have been sipping vervain
		난 지난 145년간
		매일같이 마편초를 마셨어
00:31:08	 
		난 지난 145년간
		매일같이 마편초를 마셨어
00:31:08	every single day for the last 145 years.
		난 지난 145년간
		매일같이 마편초를 마셨어
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:12	You caught me by surprise once,
		날 한번 놀래켰지
00:31:13	I wasn't going to let it happen again.
		 
		다신 그렇게 두지 않을거야
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:16	It doesn't hurt me, Stefan.
		전혀 아프지 않다구
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	What--why--
		뭐? 왜...
00:31:19	I told you.
		 
		말했잖아
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	I've missed you, Stefan.
		네가 그리웠다고
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:24	I just wanted to spend some time with you.
		너랑 같이 시간을 보내고 싶을 뿐야
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:26	Hello?
		이봐요?
00:31:27	 
		 
00:31:31	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:46	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:52	You must be Elena.
		엘레나구나
00:31:54	 
		 
00:32:05	How is this possible?
		어떻게 이게 가능할수가?
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:10	How do we look exactly alike?
		어떻게 우리는
		똑같이 생긴거죠?
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:29	You're asking the wrong questions.
		질문을 잘못 하는구나
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:33	Elena.
		엘레나
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:41	Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:43	Not really.
		전혀
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:47	Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:49	Not really.
		전혀
00:32:50	 
		 
00:33:08	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:09	Care to share how you
		어째서 내가 시킨 단순한 일도
		해내지 못한거야?
00:33:10	couldn't follow through with one simple task?
		어째서 내가 시킨 단순한 일도
		해내지 못한거야?
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:13	I tried, ok?
		노력했다구요
00:33:15	But I couldn't exactly kidnap my best friend.
		 
		하지만 내 단짝친구를
		납치할 순 없잖아요
00:33:19	Occupy her. That's all I asked.
		 
		같이 있어라
		그렇게만 부탁했어
00:33:23	I told her that her relationship was doomed.
		 
		둘의 관계가
		저주받은거라 했어요
00:33:25	And all that mortality stuff.
		 
		죽음에 대해서도 말이죠
00:33:27	I think I--I--
		 
		내 생각에... 난...
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:31	I really think that I got to her.
		내 얘기에
		넘어간 것 같아요
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:34	I hope so.
		그러길 바라
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:35	Because let's not forget. I already killed you once.
		잊지 말자구
		이미 난 널 한번 죽였어
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	I can easily do it again.
		다시 죽이는 건
		식은죽 먹기야
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:49	How was that barbecue?
		바베큐 파티 어땠어?
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:51	Not great. You still pissed?
		별로
		아직도 열받았니?
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	You still keeping secrets?
		아직도 비밀 감춰?
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:55	Yep.
		그래
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:56	Then I'm still pissed.
		그럼 아직
		열받은거야
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:59	Hey, you know, I was thinking
		있지
00:34:01	about that stone you're looking for.
		 
		삼촌이 찾던 월장석 말인데
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	I might know a couple places it could be.
		어디 있을지 알 것 같아
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:06	Do you think this is a joke?
		농담하는 건 줄 알아?
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:09	If you know where it is then tell me.
		어디 있는지 알면
		말해줘봐
00:34:10	Tell me how the curse is triggered.
		 
		그럼 저주가 어떻게
		시작되는지 말해줘
00:34:11	If I tell you, you won't be able to think about anything else.
		 
		말해주면, 넌 다른 생각은
		하지도 못하게 될거야
00:34:14	I don't want that for you.
		 
		그렇게 만들고 싶지 않아
00:34:14	I think I can handle knowing.
		 
		감당할 수 있어
00:34:16	Yeah. You think you can handle it, tough guy?
		 
		그래. 감당할 수 있지
		터프가이셔서?
00:34:18	You have no idea!
		 
		모르고 하는 소리야!
00:34:19	Do you want your stupid rock or not?!
		 
		바보같은 돌
		원해 안 원해?
00:34:20	Tell me where it is.
		 
		어디 있는지 말해
00:34:21	Tell me what triggers the curse!
		 
		저주가 어떻게 시작되냐고!
00:34:22	You have to kill somebody!
		 
		사람을 죽여야 해!
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	Human blood!
		인간 피!
00:34:25	You take a person's life away from them,
		 
		인간의 목숨을 빼앗으면
00:34:27	Then the curse is yours forever.
		 
		저주는 영원히 네 것이 되지
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:33	Can you handle that?
		이제 잘 알겠니?
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:47	Elena.
		엘레나
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:53	Oh my god, I am so sorry about earlier today.
		세상에, 요전에 정말 미안했어
00:34:57	I don't--I don't know what came over me.
		 
		무슨 생각이었는지 모르겠어
00:34:59	It's ok, Caroline.
		 
		괜찮아, 캐롤라인
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:02	Everything that you were saying was right.
		네가 한 말은 맞는 걸
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:05	It's just hard for me to hear, you know?
		직접 듣기 거북했을 뿐이지
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	So you're not mad at me?
		화 안 난거야?
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:16	You were just being a good friend...in your own way.
		좋은 친구 역할을 한거잖아
		네 방식으로
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:20	My own head-case,
		나만의 독특한
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:24	horrible way.
		끔찍한 방법으로 말이지
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:27	Elena, I really am sorry.
		엘레나, 정말 미안해
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:48	I'm starving.
		배고프다
00:35:49	Well, spending a day with your jealous ex
		 
		샘많은 전여친과
		하루를 보내면
00:35:51	will do that to you.
		 
		그러기 쉽지
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:54	Listen, I know you're upset.
		화난 거 알아
00:35:55	All right, but...
		 
		좋아
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:57	we have to take her seriously.
		심각하게 받아들여야 해
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	Today was all about the lengths that she'll go to.
		오늘은 캐더린이 무엇이든
		불사할수 있단걸 보여줬어
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:02	If she was going to hurt me, she would have.
		날 해하고 싶었다면
		이미 다쳤을거야
00:36:04	I was standing right in front of her.
		 
		바로 앞에 잇었는 걸
00:36:06	Elena, you caught her off guard.
		 
		엘레나, 예상치도 못하게 만났잖아
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	It doesn't mean that you're safe.
		안전하지 않단 뜻이야
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	I'm not afraid of her.
		캐더린이 두렵지 않아
00:36:12	Well, you should be.
		 
		두려워해야 해
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:14	If Katherine had her way,
		캐더린이 힘을 썼다면
00:36:15	we'd be breaking up right now.
		 
		지금쯤 헤어졌을거야
00:36:16	And if today taught me anything,
		 
		오늘 배운 게 있다면
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	it's that Katherine's used to getting her way.
		캐더린은 자기 뜻대로 하기 쉬워
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:21	You're not actually saying that we should do what she says.
		그렇다고 캐더린 말대로
		하자는 건 아니지?
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	Listen, she's sadistic.
		캐더린은 가학적이라구
00:36:27	Ok. She threatened you.
		 
		널 협박했어
00:36:29	She threatened everyone.
		 
		모두를 협박했고
00:36:31	Yeah. No. I get it, ok. She's dangerous.
		 
		알아. 위험하단 걸
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:34	But every day that we're together. It's dangerous.
		하지만 매일 함께 있는 것도
		위험한 거잖아
00:36:37	Why are you giving her so much power
		 
		왜 우리 관계가 캐더린에 의해
		좌지우지 되는건대?
00:36:39	over our relationship?
		 
		왜 우리 관계가 캐더린에 의해
		좌지우지 되는건대?
00:36:40	This is the reality of our situation.
		 
		우리 현실이 그러니까
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	Reality sucks.
		현실은 엿같아
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:48	This is what she wants, Stefan.
		그녀가 원하는건 이거야
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	She wants us to fight.
		우리가 싸우길 바라지
00:36:52	She wants get between us.
		 
		우리 사이를 가로막길 원하고
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:58	She already has, Elena.
		이미 들어와 있는 걸, 엘레나
00:36:59	 
		 
00:37:39	Bad day?
		운 없는 날이야?
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:42	Bad century.
		운 없는 세기겠지
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:45	I heard you were on the loose.
		네가 날뛰고 다닌단 거 들었어
00:37:46	What's the matter? Jealous I spent the day with Stefan?
		 
		뭐가 문제인데?
		스테판과 같이 있었던게 샘나니?
00:37:50	I don't do jealous. Not with you.
		 
		샘나지 않아
		너한테는
00:37:53	 
		 
00:37:53	Not anymore.
		더 이상은
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:56	Then why so pouty?
		그럼 왜 삐죽거리는데?
00:37:58	 
		 
00:37:58	I tried to kill a werewolf and failed.
		늑대인간 죽이려다
		실패했거든
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	Now I feel like I'm not living up to my best self.
		최선을 다하지 못한 것 같아서 말이지
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:03	Well, werewolves aren't easy prey.
		늑대인간은 쉬운 먹이가 아냐
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:06	What do you know about werewolves?
		뭘 아는데?
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:07	Why don't you ask your brother?
		동생한테 물어보지 그래?
00:38:09	 
		 
00:38:10	Don't try to be the hero, Damon. You'll end up dead.
		영웅이 되려 하지 마
		그러다 죽는다구
00:38:13	Been there, done that.
		 
		난 이미 경험이 있는 걸
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	At least this time it will have been worth it.
		최소한 이번에는
		가치가 있겠지
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:46	You ok?
		괜찮아?
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:54	I hated that fight.
		싸운 거 싫었어
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	I know, me, too. It felt too real.
		알아. 너무 진짜 같았지
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:07	Did you see Caroline?
		캐롤라인 봤어?
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:08	Yeah.
		그래
00:39:09	We were right. Katherine got to her.
		 
		우리가 옳았어
		캐더린이 시킨거야
00:39:11	She was hanging on to every single word.
		 
		내가 하는 말마다
		가로 막더라고
00:39:13	Then it won't be long before Katherine gets a play-by-play.
		 
		곧 캐더린이
		실황 중계를 하게 될거야
00:39:16	I wish I was wrong,
		 
		틀린 거 알지만
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	but I know Caroline too well.
		난 캐롤라인을 잘 알아
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:20	It was so obvious that something was up today.
		뭔가 일이 있었던게
		틀림 없었어
00:39:22	You're not wrong. It's pure Katherine.
		 
		틀린게 아냐
		명백히 캐더린 짓이지
00:39:24	She's always finding somebody to do her dirty work.
		 
		늘 뒷 일을 해줄
		사람을 찾거든
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:27	I think Damon was listening to us fight, too.
		데이먼도 우리 싸우는 소리
		들은 거 같아
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	Are you gonna tell him that it wasn't real?
		진짜가 아니었다고 말할거야?
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:33	The only way Katherine's gonna believe it
		캐더린이 믿을수 있는 유일한 길은
00:39:34	is if everybody believes it.
		 
		다른 모두가 믿어야 하지
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:36	It's the best way to make her think she's getting what she wants.
		자기가 원하는 걸 얻었다고
		믿게 만드는게 최선의 방법이야
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:39	All this...
		이 모든게
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:41	just to get you back.
		그저 널 되찾기 위했던 거라고
00:39:43	 
		 
00:39:47	That's not why she's here. Ok?
		날 위해 돌아온 게 아냐
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:50	No matter what she says.
		뭐라고 말하든
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:52	I know her.
		난 캐더린을 잘 알아
00:39:53	 
		 
00:39:54	Katherine doesn't care about anybody but herself.
		캐더린은 자기 외엔
		아무도 신경 안 쓰지
00:39:58	 
		 
00:40:00	She never has.
		늘 그랬어
00:40:01	 
		 
00:40:02	She's incapable of love.
		사랑이란 걸 할 수 없어
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:08	She's here for another reason.
		뭔가 다른 이유를 위해 온거야
00:40:09	 
		 
00:40:14	George.
		조지
00:40:15	 
		 
00:40:15	Your carriage is waiting.
		마차가 기다리고 있소
00:40:16	Well done, George. Thank you.
		 
		잘했어요, 조지
		고마워요
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:18	Now on to your part of the deal.
