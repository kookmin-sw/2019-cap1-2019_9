		a less awkward
		미안

		덜 어색한 방법이 있다면
		그렇게 할텐데
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:50	Doesn't bother me.
		난 괜찮은데
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:53	These symbols must
		have been left for the hunters
		이 문양은 헌터를
		위해 남겨졌을거야
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:55	so they could
		find the cure,
		그래야 치료제를
		찾을수 있지
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	and this must be
		the story of Qetsiyah and Silas.
		이건 켓시야와
		사일러스 이야기일테고
00:04:59	 
		 
00:04:59	According to Shane,
		Silas asked Qetsiyah
		쉐인교수님에 따르면
		사일러스가 부탁을 했데
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	for help making a spell
		for immortality.
		켓시야보고 불멸 주문을
		만들어달라고
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:06	She helped make him
		immortal, only to learn
		불멸로 만들었더니
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	he planned to use
		the same spell on
		같은 주문을
		그녀가 아닌
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	another woman, not her
		다른 여자한테
		사용할 계획이었던거야
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	when she found out,
		she freaked.
		그걸 알아내고
		충격받았지
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:14	So, Qetsiyah killed
		the other woman?
		그래서 켓시야가
		다른 여자를 죽인거야?
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:18	Yeah. Silas
		was immortal.
		응 사일러스는
		죽지 않으니까
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	She couldn't kill him.
		죽일수가 없었지
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	So, she trapped him
		in a cave
		그래서 무덤에
		함정을 파고
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	and buried him
		alive instead.
		산채로 묻었어
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:34	Does it say anything about
		the hunter's purpose in all this?
		여기에 헌터의
		의도같은건 없어?
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	I was wondering
		when you'd ask.
		네가 물어봤을때
		놀랐어
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:40	Qetsiyah created
		a cure for immortality
		켓시야는 불멸의
		치료제를 만들었어
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	and then she
		buried it with Silas,
		그리고 사일러스를
		묻었지
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	hoping that he'd
		take it and die.
		치료제를 사용하고
		죽길 바란거야
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	End up on the other
		side with her
		저승에서 자신과
		함께하길 바란거야
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:47	for all eternity.
		영원토록
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	But he wouldn't
		give her the satisfaction.
		그치만 사일러스는 그녀가
		만족하게 하지 않았어
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:50	So, many centuries
		later, her descendants
		오랜 시간 뒤에
		그녀의 후손이
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	created the hunters to find him,
		cure him, and kill him.
		사일러스를 찾아 불멸을
		치료한후 죽이려고 헌터를 만든거야
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:55	You know what?
		I'll explain on the hike.
		가면서 설명해줄게
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	Come on.
		We gotta get going.
		어서 가야되
00:05:59	 
		 
00:06:18	Morning, Sunshine.
		안녕 형씨
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	You look pathetic.
		불쌍해보이네
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Only until Bonnie's spell
		locking me in here wears off.
		보니의 주문이
		끝날때까지만이야
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	Then I'll look different.
		그럼 다르게
		보일거야
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:31	Angrier, perhaps.
		아마 화나있을걸
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	Or, I won't look
		like anything,
		아니면 아무것도
		안보일지도
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	because I'll have gouged your
		eyeballs from their sockets.
		네 눈알을
		뽑아버릴테니까
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	My friends will be
		back with the cure by then.
		그때쯤이면 친구들이
		치료제를 찾아올거야
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	So, I could shove it
		down your throat
		네 목에
		쑤셔넣고
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	and make you mortal.
		인간으로
		만들어야지
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	I'm an original.
		난 오리지날이야
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	What makes you think
		my entire vampire bloodline
		내 혈통 전체가
		나와 같이
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	won't be cured
		along with me?
		치료되지 않을거라
		생각하지?
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	I.E., you.
		즉 너말이야
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	You know what I think?
		내 생각이
		뭔지 알아?
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:55	I think
		that's impossible.
		불가능하다고
		생각해
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	I think the moment
		you stop being a vampire,
		네가 뱀파이어가
		아닌 순간
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	our whole blood connection
		to you is broken,
		너와의 혈통관계가
		사라지면
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	and your sire-line
		ceases to exist.
		종속계통도
		없어질거야
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	So, whatever
		happens to you,
		그니까 너한테
		무슨일이 생기든
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	happens only to you,
		오직 너한테만
		일어나는거야
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:10	which means I can
		kill your ass
		곧 내가 널
		죽일수 있다는거지
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	and no one else
		has to die.
		아무도 죽지
		않아도 되고
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	Although I am still debating
		just how to do it.
		근데 어떻게 할지는
		아직 고민중이야
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	I recommend drowning.
		익사를 추천해
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	There's nothing quite
		like the feeling of
		숨쉬려고 발버둥
		치는 사람을
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	someone fighting for something
		as basic as human breath.
		만지는것보다
		좋은건 없어
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	And let me tell you,
		your mother was a fighter.
		말해 주자면
		네 엄마는 투사였어
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:42	Satellite phone
		lost its signal.
		위성 전화
		신호가 안잡혀
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	That's a good sign.
		좋은 징조네
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:47	Is anyone else
		a little creeped out?
		무서운 사람
		없어요?
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:50	So, then leave.
		Out of everyone,
		그럼 떠나
		우리들 말고
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	your presence is
		the least necessary.
		네가 필요한
		사람이 있긴 할거야
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	Please don't start.
		그만해
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	I'm merely stating
		the facts.
		사실을 말한거야
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	Jeremy has the spell
		on his body.
		제레미는 몸에
		주문이 있고
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Bonnie's the witch
		that unseals the cure.
		보니는 치료제를
		구할 마녀고
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	Shane is
		the human compass.
		쉐인은
		인간 나침반
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	You and I have
		the tombstone,
		너랑 나는
		묘비가 있고
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	which does
		God knows what.
		어디 써먹을데가
		있을거야
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	And Elena has no point.
		엘레나는
		아무것도 없어
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:08	What about me?
		나는?
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	You have a nice behind.
		넌 뒷태가 이뻐
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:19	Centuries after
		Qetsiyah died,
		켓시야가 죽고나서
		몇백년뒤에
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	there were these miners
		who were excavating
		섬에 광천지에서
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	a well on the island.
		굴착을 하던
		광부가 있었어
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	Suddenly went mad.
		갑자기 미쳐버렸고
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	Bled themselves dry.
		No apparent reason.
		광천지는 말라버렸어
		아무 이유도 없이
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	So, the legend spread
		that these miners,
		전설은 광부들로부터
		나온것이지
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	in exchange for
		a drop of their blood,
		피 한방울의
		대가로
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	saw visions of their
		lost loved ones
		사랑했던 사람의
		환영을 볼 수 있었어
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	in the well
		they were digging.
		그들이 팠던
		광천지에서
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:38	The word traveled
		and explorers
		소문은 퍼졌고
		탐험가들은
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	sought out the well
		광천지를
		찾아냈어
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	to see if
		the legend was true.
		전설이 사실인지
		확인하려고
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	So, the well
		was magic?
		그럼 광천지에
		마법이 있던거에요?
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	Yeah. Some people
		believe the voices of lost souls
		응 어떤사람들은
		환영의 목소리가
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	were just a wind
		vortex whipping through caves.
		동굴 바람소리라고
		믿었어
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	And visions were caused
		by inhaling the island's
		환영은 독성 식물의
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	poisonous plant life.
		가스를 들여마셔서
		나타났다고 생각해
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:57	And what do
		you believe?
		당신은 뭐라고
		믿어요?
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	I believe in magic.
		난 마법이라고 믿어
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:01	My wife and my son
		내 아내와 내 아들은
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	died within months
		of each other.
		몇 달안에
		죽어서
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:07	And so...I decided to try
		the well out for myself.
		광천지에
		가기로 결심했지
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:17	I offered up my blood
		and waited.
		피를 바치고
		기다렸지
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:28	Hello? Hello?
		여보세요?
		여보세요?
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	Atticus?
		아티커스?
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:34	Caitlin. Caitlin?
		Caitlin?
		케이틀린?
		케이틀린?
00:09:38	 
		 
00:10:11	Whoa!
		 
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:14	Oh!
		 
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:26	Hello, Atty.
		안녕 애티
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:31	Caitlin.
		케이틀린
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	I saw my wife.
		아내를 봤어
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	I saw her eyes.
		눈동자도 보고
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	Her smile.
		미소도 봤어
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:40	My blood let me
		see her again.
		내 피가 다시
		만나게 해준거야
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	Yeah, got it.
		그래 알았어
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	Don't eat the
		poisonous flowers.
		독있는 꽃은
		먹지마
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:51	Wait. Stop.
		Stop! Stop.
		잠깐 멈춰
		멈춰봐
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:56	Is everybody
		paying attention?
		다들 집중했어?
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:59	Our first lesson
		in survival.
		살아남기 위한
		첫번째 강의야
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:07	Stay together.
		Keep your eyes open.
		함께 다니고
		주위를 잘 살펴
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:13	I want
		a water.
		물 마시고 싶어
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	Here. Take mine.
		여기 내꺼 마셔
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:19	Magic well?
		Seriously?
		마법의 광천지?
		진짜로?
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	I don't know.
		I mean...
		모르겠어
		나는...
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	We've all lost someone.
		우리 모두 누군가를
		잃었잖아
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	The chance to maybe
		see them again?
		그들을 다시
		볼 수 있는 기회잖아?
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	I kinda get it.
		어느정도 이해가 되
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:37	Jeremy!
		제레미
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:41	Aah!
		 
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:47	What the hell
		just happened?
		방금 뭐야?
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Somebody
		just saved my life.
		누가 날
		구해줬어
00:11:51	 
		 
00:12:04	What is this place?
		여긴 어디야?
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	According to
		island lore,
		설화에 따르면
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	a group of college kids
		came here for spring break.
		봄방학때 몇몇 아이들이
		여기 왔다가
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:10	A few weeks later,
		they were all found dead,
		몇주뒤에 모두
		죽은채로 발견됬데
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	completely drained
		of blood.
		피가 하나도
		없는채로
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	Well, tragic for them,
		brilliant for us.
		걔들한테는 안됬지만
		우리한텐 멋지네
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	Who sleeps where?
		누가 어디서 잘래?
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	Well, that's lovely.
		사랑스럽네
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	There's a mystery man
		with a hatchet
		숲에 도끼를 들고
		다니는
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	lurking in the woods
		수상한 사람이
		있는데
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	and we're just
		gonna camp?
		여기서 캠프를
		한다고?
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	We're safer here
		than we are
		어둠속에
		있는것보다는
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	hiking in the dark.
		여기 있는게 안전해
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:26	Let's just keep going.
		You know?
		계속 가보자구
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	Get the cure. Get in, get out.
		Where is it?
		치료제 찾으러
		어딨어?
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	How stupid do you
		think I am?
		내가 얼마나
		멍청하다고 생각해?
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	Stupid enough to raise
		an immortal witch,
		불멸의 마녀를
		깨울만큼 멍청하지
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	so I'd say...incredibly.
		그니까 엄청나게
		멍청한거지
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	Yeah, I'm shocked you
		even want the cure,
		그래 나도 네가
		치료제를 원해서 놀랐어
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	considering you've got
		the most to lose
		엘레나가 사람이
		되는 즉시
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	once Elena's human.
		가장 큰것을
		잃게될텐데 말이지
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:54	Shane doesn't know what
		he's talking about.
		쉐인은 자기가 무슨말
		하는지도 몰라요
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	We'll find out
		tomorrow.
		내일이면
		알게되겠지
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	Do you really think I'm
		gonna take this cure,
		내가 정말로 당신과
		종속을 끊고 사랑도 끝내려고
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	break the sire bond,
		and fall out of love with you?
		치료제를
		사용할거라 생각해요?
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	No. I'm saying
		we don't know.
		아니 우리도
		모른다고 생각해
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:08	And if we find it
		tomorrow, we will.
		내일 찾아내면
		알게되겠지
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	This cure is gonna
		change so many things.
		치료제가 많은것을
		바꿀거에요
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	Jeremy's not gonna want
		to kill me anymore.
		제레미는 더이상
		날 죽이려하지 않고
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	We're finally gonna
		get rid of Klaus.
		드디어 클라우스도
		처치하고
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	Bonnie's mom isn't
		gonna be a vampire.
		보니 엄마도 뱀파이어가
		아니게 되고
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	And anyone who wants
		to take this cure
		치료제를 원한다면
		누구나
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	is gonna have
		that option.
		사용할 수
		있을거에요
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	Caroline, Stefan,
		and you.
		캐롤라인 스테판
		당신도
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:30	If you want it.
		원하기만 한다면요
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:34	I get it.
		Everything changes tomorrow.
		알았어 내일
		모든게 달라지겠네
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	It'll be all
		unicorns and rainbows.
		전부 유니콘이랑
		무지개가 되겠네
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	No, not everything.
		That's what I'm saying.
		아뇨 모든게 아니에요
		그 말을 하잖아요
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:44	Damon, not my feelings
		for you.
		데이먼 당신을 향한
		내 감정은 바뀌지 않아요
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:54	Mm.
		 
00:13:56	 
		 
00:14:10	You're still here?
		What are you doing?
		아직도 여깄어?
		뭐해?
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:14	Gloating.
		고소해하지
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:17	Hello, Caroline.
		안녕 캐롤라인
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:22	Come home.
		집에가자
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	Don't stoop
		to his level.
		똑같이 굴지마
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	He destroyed
		my life.
		내 인생을
		무너뜨렸어
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:29	I plan on
		being present
		고통받을때마다
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	for every second
		of his misery
		항상 지켜볼
		생각이야
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	until I can
		kill him myself.
		내손으로 죽이기
		전까지
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:35	Fine. You can gloat
		and multitask.
		알았어 고소해하면서
		다른 일도 해
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:37	This place
		is a disaster.
		여긴 엉망이야
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	Starting with
		a horrific burnt corpse.
		끔찍하게 타버린
		시체부터 하자
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:56	Tyler's mother is dead.
		So is my brother.
		타일러 엄마는 죽었고
		내 동생도 마찬가지야
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	We're even.
		이정도면
		공평하잖아
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:05	Call Bonnie
		보니한테 전화해서
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	and get her to let me
		out of here.
		여기서 날
		꺼내라고 해
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	I will never, ever,
		help you.
		절대로 당신을
		안도와줄거야
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	How quickly you
		forget the part
		늑대인간의
		저주에서
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	where I saved Tyler
		from the misery
		타일러를 구해준걸
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	of being a werewolf.
		벌써 잊었구나
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	Or the night your mother
		invited me into her home
		아니면 너희 엄마가
		불러서
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	to save the life of her
		precious daughter.
		네 목숨을 구해준걸
		잊은거야
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	How delusional
		are you?
		왜 그렇게
		망상에 빠졌어?
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	You killed his mother.
		넌 타일러
		어머니를 죽였어
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	And let's not forget
		that we're standing in a house
		엘레나 이모
		제나가 여기서
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	where Elena's Aunt Jenna
		used to live.
		살았단것도
		잊지 말자
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:34	Or did you think
		that your charm
		네가 매력있어서
		제나를 죽인것도
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	would make us forget
		how you killed her, too?
		눈감아 줄거라 생각해?
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	You know what? No.
		I am not going to engage in this.
		게다가... 됬다
		참견하지 않을거야
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	You are not even worth
		the calories I burn talking to you.
		너한테 말하느라
		소비할 칼로리가 아깝다
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:47	No!
		안돼
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	Uhh!
		 
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:59	Now, that was definitely
		worth the calories.
		이런건 칼로리를
		소비할만하지
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:05	Well, 7 of us and no one
		thought to bring s'mores.
		7명중 아무도 고구마를
		안가져오다니
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:09	What are you doing
		with that?
		그거로 뭐하게?
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	We're a day away from
		finding the cure.
		내일이면 치료제를
		찾을거니까
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	Not letting it
		out of my sight.
		눈 밖에
		놔두지 않을거야
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:19	Do you hear that?
		들었어?
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	I swear this place
		is haunted.
		여기 귀신들린게
		분명해
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	Um...you're
		crushing my arm.
		팔 부서지겠다
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:30	Ok. You got me.
		I'm a scaredy cat.
		알았어 딱걸렸네
		나 겁쟁이야
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	You do realize you're an
		original vampire, right?
		너 오리지널
		뱀파인거 알고 있지?
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	Which is precisely why
		you should stop teasing me.
		그러니까 너도
		그만 놀리는게 좋을거야
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	I'm very powerful.
		난 매우 힘세니까
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:44	What are you gonna do
		when Elena becomes human
		엘레나가 사람이 되서
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	and comes running back
		to you?
		너한테 돌아오면
		어떻게 할거야?
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:49	You said that you'd take the cure
		to be with her.
		치료제를 써서 엘레나와
		함께 할거라 했잖아
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	You'd have children
		and grow old.
		아이도 갖고
		함께 늙어가는거
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	Is it still true?
		아직도 그래?
00:16:58	 
		 
00:17:00	Why do you want
		to take it?
		넌 치료제를
		왜 사용하고 싶어?
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	Aren't you
		the perfect vampire?
		완벽한 뱀파이어
		아니었어?
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	Isn't it obvious?
		당연한거 아냐?
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:09	It's all an act, Stefan.
		전부 가식이야
		스테판
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	Being a vampire
		is miserable.
		뱀파이어는
		불행해
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:17	I would give anything
		to be human.
		인간이 된다면
		무엇이든 내줄거야
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	Normal.
		평범하게
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:27	If I take the cure...
		It wouldn't be for her.
		내가 치료제를 사용한다면
		엘레나를 위해서가 아니라
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:33	It'd be for me.
		나 자신을
		위해서지
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:43	I've been staring
		at pictures of Jeremy's tattoo
		제레미 문신사진을
		보고 있었는데
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	and there's no spell.
		주문따윈 없었어요
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	Expression doesn't
		require a written spell.
		익스프레션은
		주문이 필요치 않아
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	Just think of it
		as a way of
		네 안에 이미
		존재하는
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	accessing magic that
		already exists inside you.
		마법에 접근한다고
		생각해
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	You just have to
		want it bad enough.
		네가 간절히
		원하기만 하면되
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	And I'm just supposed
		to trust you?
		그냥 교수님만
		믿으라구요?
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	Bonnie, listen,
		I taught you expression
		보니 들어봐
		익스프레션을 가르친건
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	so that you could
		access the cure.
		치료제에 접근하기
		위해서야
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	I'll be right there with you
		the whole time. Promise.
		계속 네 곁에 있을게
		약속해
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	You didn't answer
		the trust part.
		믿어도 되냐는
		질문은 대답안했어
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:08	All right.
		Let me put it this way.
		알았어
		이렇게 해두자
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	You need me to help
		you through it, Bonnie.
		네가 이걸 해내려면
		내 도움이 필요해
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	And as you've demonstrated,
		expression can get messy.
		이미 해봤듯이
		익스프레션은 위험할수 있어
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	Believe me when I say I've
		seen it get a lot worse.
		더 심한것도 봤으니
		내 말 믿어
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	How much worse?
		얼마나 심했는데?
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	When we lost our son
		in the car accident,
		차사고로 아들을
		잃었을때
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	my wife kind of lost it.
		아내는 미친거나
		다름없었어
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:26	She tried to resurrect
		his body using magic.
		마법을 사용해서
		부활시키려고 했어
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:30	Your wife was a witch?
		아내가 마녀였어요?
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	She was
		a powerful witch.
		강력한 마녀였지
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	And incredibly
		undisciplined.
		엄청나게
		잘못된 행동이었어
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	And you never thought
		to tell me?
		나한테 말할 생각은
		전혀 안들었어요?
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	I just didn't want
		to scare you.
		겁주기 싫었어
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	The truth is, she tried
		진실은 그녀가
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	to bring our son back
		using expression,
		익스프레션을 사용해서
		아들을 살리려다가
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	and it overwhelmed her,
		and she died.
		압도당해서
		죽고 말았어
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	You taught me the same
		magic that killed your wife?
		아내를 죽인 마법을
		나한테 가르친거에요?
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	Yeah, but look,
		the upside is,
		그래 허나
		바꿔 생각하면
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	I've learned the warning
		signs, all right?
		위험한 징후를
		내가 안다는거잖아?
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	I can keep expression
		from consuming you.
		네가 익스프레션에
		사로잡히지 않게 해줄게
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	Downside is, you turned
		her into a bomb
		달리 보면 네가 그녀를
		폭탄으로 만든거잖아
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	that only you
		can dismantle.
		오직 너만이
		해체할수 있게
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	Don't you think I know
		how this ends?
		이게 어떻게 될지
		내가 모를것 같아?
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:59	I came here
		to raise Silas
		사일러스를 부활하러
		여기 왔어
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	so that he could
		bring back the dead,
		죽은이들을
		살려내려고
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	but you're never gonna
		let that happen.
		그치만 넌 절대로
		그렇게 두지 않겠지
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	The second I point
		to a cure, you're gonna kill me.
		치료제를 가르키는 즉시
		날 죽일거잖아
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:11	Now Bonnie has to
		keep me alive
		보니는 이제
		내가 살아있어야되
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	so that I can
		keep her alive.
		그래야 내가
		보니를 살리지
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:43	Oh, my God.
		Oh, my God.
		오 이런
		세상에
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	Oh, my God.
		Oh, my God.
		세상에
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	Oh, my God...
		Hey. Hey.
		-세상에나
		-자기야
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	Look at me.
		Look at me.
		나 봐
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	I can fix this.
		내가 해결할게
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	How? The only thing
		어떻게?
		날 치료할수
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	that can heal me
		is his blood.
		있는건
		저놈 피뿐인데
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	- Oh, my God...
		- I know.
		-세상에
		-알아
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:59	I'll fix it.
		내가 고칠게
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:08	She'll die if you
		don't heal her.
		네가 살리지 않으면
		죽게 될거야
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:11	Ok.
		알았어
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:19	Beg me to save
		her life.
		살려달라고 빌어봐
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	Is this what
		you want?
		원하는게 그거야?
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	To remind me that
		I'm powerless against you?
		널 상대로 무력하단걸
		상기시키려고?
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	Fine. You win.
		I'm nothing.
		좋아 네가 이겼어
		난 아무것도 아냐
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	Now, save her.
		Please.
		이제 살려내
		제발
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	I'm sorry, mate.
		I didn't quite catch that.
		미안한데 친구
		못알아먹겠어
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	Please.
		제발
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	Please...
		제발...뭐
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:40	Please save her life.
		제발 살려줘
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:44	See, now I think
		you're just
		봤지 이제는
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	telling me what
		I want to hear.
		내가 듣고싶은걸
		말할것 같네
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	I mean, you did call
		me pathetic earlier.
		좀전에 나보고
		한심하다고 했지
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	And wouldn't it be more
		pathetic of me to help now,
		이제와 도와주면
		내가 더 한심하지 않겠어?
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	knowing that hours
		ago, you announced
		바로 몇시간전에
		그랬잖아
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	your plan to kill me
		in a manner in which
		날 죽일계획을
		발표했잖아
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	you're still
		debating because
		어떤 스타일로
		죽일지
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	you want it to have
		a certain amount of flair?
		아직도
		고민중이라며?
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	I'm just asking.
		그냥 물어본거야
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:04	I'll be your
		slave again.
		다시 노예가 될게
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	I'll do whatever
		you want.
		네가 원하는대로 할게
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	Just help her.
		도와주기나 해
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	No.
		싫어
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:16	Get me out of here.
		여기서 데려가줘
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:20	I can't even
		look at him.
		처다보지도
		못하겠어
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	Come on.
		가자
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:29	Jeremy!
		제레미
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	Did you find
		anything?
		뭐 좀 찾았어?
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	He's not on the trail.
		흔적도 없어
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:34	His gear's
		still here.
		장비는 여깄어
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	He's not
		at the quarry, either.
		채석장에도 없어
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:38	Split up.
		흩어지자
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	I'm gonna stay and try
		a locator spell.
		난 여기서 위치추적
		마법 해볼게요
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:43	Ok. I'll stay here.
		나도 여기 있을게
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	I'll make sure
		she's safe.
		안전하게 해야되니까
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	I'll stay here and make sure
		you're not lying.
		난 쉐인이 거짓말하는지
		확인할게
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:52	Fine. We'll keep
		searching the island.
		알았어요 우린
		섬을 찾아볼게요
00:21:54	 
		 
00:22:11	Thought it didn't work.
		안된다면서
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	Yeah. I'm just--
		just checking the signal.
		그래 신호 확인
		하던거였어
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	So you can call someone?
		누구한테 전화하려고?
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:18	Like whoever
		took Jeremy?
		제레미를
		데려간사람한테?
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:20	This place has a habit
		of getting to you, doesn't it?
		여기와서
		짜증나지 그렇지?
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:23	See for yourself.
		직접 확인해봐
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:25	I'm done trusting you.
		너 믿는거 관둘래
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	Uhh!
		Where's the cure?
		치료제 어딨어?
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:29	You know that magical well I was
		telling you about?
		내가 말한
		마법의 광천지있지?
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	Silas and the cure
		are buried deep below it.
		사일러스랑 치료제는
		거기 묻혀있어
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	So, you've seen it?
		그래서 너도 본거야?
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	No.
		아니
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	But you could say I heard it from
		a reliable source.
		그렇지만 믿어도
		되는 정보라 할수있지
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:43	Caitlin.
		케이틀린
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:45	How is this happening?
		어떻게 된거야?
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:47	You're bleeding.
		What?
		-피흘리고 있어
		-뭐?
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	Oh, my God.
		Oh, my God.
		오 이럴수가
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:51	No. It's good.
		It's ok.
		아냐 괜찮아
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	It's what's
		keeping me here.
		내가 여기 있는게
		그것 때문이야
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	If a single drop of blood
		can give you a vision,
		피 한방울이면
		환영을 볼 수 있고
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	could you imagine what
		two liters could do?
		2리터면 뭐가
		가능할거같아?
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	What does your dead wife
		have to do with a cure?
		죽은 처가 치료제로
		뭘 하려는거야?
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	She got nothing to do
		with a cure,
		치료제랑은
		상관없지만
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	but she has everything
		to do with Silas.
		사일러스랑은
		관련이 있지
00:23:07	 
		 
00:23:07	I'm so sorry I let
		things get out of control.
		일이 제멋대로
		되서 미안해
00:23:09	 
		 
00:23:09	I should've stopped you.
		널 멈추게 해야
		했었는데
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:10	Sweetheart, it's ok.
		자기야 괜찮아
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:12	You wanted Sam back
		as much as I did.
		나만큼이나 샘이
		되돌아오길 바랬잖아
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:18	What if you had a second
		chance to bring us both back?
		우리 둘다 살릴수 있는
		기회가 있다면?
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	I can't, baby.
		I'm not a witch.
		난 못해 자기야
		마녀가 아니잖아
00:23:23	 
		 
00:23:23	We have a witch.
		마녀는 있어
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:25	His name is Silas.
		이름은 사일러스야
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:29	If you set him free, he'll help
		those who have helped him.
		그를 풀어주면
		자기를 도와줄거야
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	Set him free from--
		from what?
		풀어주다니...
		뭐로부터?
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	He's entombed
		in the caves below us,
		우리아래쪽에
		묻혀있어
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	but it's impossible
		to get him out
		주문없이 꺼내기는
		불가능해
00:23:39	 
		주문없이 꺼내기는
		불가능해
00:23:39	without a spell.
		주문없이 꺼내기는
		불가능해
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:42	You need to get
		the spell.
		주문을 얻어야되
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:45	And that's when she explained
		내가 해야되는걸
		알켜준게 그때야
00:23:46	 
		내가 해야되는걸
		알켜준게 그때야
00:23:46	everything that I had to do.
		내가 해야되는걸
		알켜준게 그때야
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	Complete the Hunter's
		mark to access the spell
		헌터의 표식을 완성해서
		주문에 접근하고
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	and empower a descendant
		of Qetsiyah to perform it.
		켓시야의 후손이
		행할수 있는 힘을 주고
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:58	Bonnie Bennett's related
		to this crazy-ass witch?
		보니 배넷이 미친 마녀
		친척이라는거야?
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:58	Jeremy!
		제레미
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	Jeremy!
		Why don't you yell louder?
		-제레미
		-더크게 외치지?
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	Maybe we haven't
		drawn enough attention
		어쩌면 주의를 충분히
		끌지 못하는걸지도 몰라
00:25:05	 
		어쩌면 주의를 충분히
		끌지 못하는걸지도 몰라
00:25:05	to ourselves already.
		어쩌면 주의를 충분히
		끌지 못하는걸지도 몰라
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	I'm sorry, and how
		are you helping?
		미안한데 어떻게
		도와준다고?
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	I'm stronger than you
		and faster than you
		너보다 힘세고
		빠르고
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:10	and I'm quite certain
		장담하는데
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	I can charm
		the islanders
		섬사람도 너보다 쉽게
		꼬실수 있어
00:25:12	 
		섬사람도 너보다 쉽게
		꼬실수 있어
00:25:12	a lot easier
		thank you.
		섬사람도 너보다 쉽게
		꼬실수 있어
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:14	Not disagreeing
		on the easy part.
		쉽게 꼬시는 부분은
		아닌것 같은데
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	All right, we get it.
		You two hate each other.
		알았어 서로
		싫어하는거 알겠어
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	Can we just
		keep going, please?
		계속 가자 좀?
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	I tried
		being her friend,
		친구가 되려고
		그러는거야
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	but somehow, I ended up
		with a dagger in my back
		그런데 내 등에
		단검 꽂히게 되고 말았지
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	because I'm the evil one.
		사악한건 나니까
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:23	Technically, you didn't
		achieve evil status
		엄밀히 따지면
		날 죽이기 전까지는
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	until you killed me.
		사악한 단계는 아니었어
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:40	Nice catch.
		Thank you.
		-잘 잡았어
		-고마워
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:43	No, actually,
		thank you.
		아냐
		고마운건 나지
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:45	This thing
		would've killed me.
		이것때문에
		죽을뻔했어
00:25:47	 
		 
00:25:47	I don't care what
		happens to you either way.
		너한테 뭔일이 생겨도
		관심없어
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	But if you're gonna die,
		it might as well be epic.
		그치만 네가 죽는다면
		그또한 장관일거야
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:55	I'm gonna go back
		and check on Bonnie,
		돌아가서
		보니 살펴볼게
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	see if she
		found anything.
		찾은거 뭐 없는지
00:25:59	 
		 
00:25:59	Be careful.
		조심해
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:06	You have the rock,
		hunter, Bennett witch.
		돌도 있고 헌터에
		배넷가 마녀까지
00:26:11	 
		 
00:26:13	What about the dozens
		that died in sacrifice?
		12명의 제물은 뭐야?
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	Where do they
		fit in to all this?
		걔들은 어느부분에
		속하는거야?
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	As you can imagine, that was
		not an easy pill to swallow.
		네가 상상하듯이
		나도 그건 힘들었어
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:20	Caitlin, it's me,
		케이틀린
		나야
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	the guy who refused to serve
		a meat course at our wedding.
		결혼식때 육류음식도
		반대한 사람이야
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:24	I can't--I can't
		orchestrate 3 massacres.
		3건의 대참사를
		조직할 수는 없어
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	It isn't like that.
		그런게 아냐
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	You're merely
		leading these people
		그 사람들을 단지
		연결시켜주는것 뿐이야
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:31	so Silas can bring them
		back from the dead.
		사일러스가 죽음에서
		되돌아올수 있게
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	Why--why should they die
		just to be resurrected?
		금방 부활될텐데
		왜 죽어야되?
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	It doesn't make sense.
		말이 안되잖아
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	The spell that
		brings me back
		날 되살릴 주문은
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	requires a witch
		to channel
		마녀에게 엄청난
		에너지가 필요해
00:26:40	 
		마녀에게 엄청난
		에너지가 필요해
00:26:40	an extreme amount
		of mystical energy.
		마녀에게 엄청난
		에너지가 필요해
00:26:43	 
		 
00:26:43	Energy that doesn't
		occur in nature.
		그런 에너지는
		저절로 생기지 않아
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	Because it
		isn't natural.
		자연적인게
		아니니까 그렇지
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:48	I'm sorry, Cate.
		미안해 케이트
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:52	I just--I can't do that
		to innocent people.
		무고한 사람들에게
		그럴순 없어
00:26:54	 
		 
00:27:04	Can you feel my touch?
		내가 만지는게
		느껴져?
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	How is this possible?
		이건 어떻게 가능해?
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	Because you believe
		it is possible.
		당신이 가능하다고
		믿으니까
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:11	You believe that you
		can see me again.
		날 다시 볼거라
		믿었으니까
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:15	You don't have to
		take a single
		단 한사람도
00:27:17	 
		 
00:27:17	human life yourself,
		Atticus.
		죽일 필요없어
		애티커스
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:21	All you have to do
		is convince someone
		당신이 할일은
		그 일을 할만한 사람을
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:23	to believe that
		it is possible
		믿게 설득하면되
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:25	that they can see
		a lost loved one again.
		그 사람이 사랑했던 이를
		다시 볼 수 있다고
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:29	And they'll do it
		for you.
		그러면 그 사람이
		알아서 할거야
00:27:31	 
		 
00:27:35	Which is how you
		manipulated the pastor
		그렇게 목사를
		조종했구나
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:37	to blow up a farmhouse
		full of people.
		사람이 가득한
		농장을 폭파시키라고
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	He just wanted to
		see his wife again.
		자기 아내를 다시
		보고 싶어했을뿐이야
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:45	We need 3 massacres.
		3건의 대참사가
		필요한데
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	Fire at the young farm.
		영목장에서 폭발
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:48	Holiday hybrid slaughter.
		기념일날
		죽은 하이브리드들
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	What mass blood-letting
		am I forgetting?
		내가 까먹은
		대참사가 뭐지?
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	You're not.
		까먹은게 아냐
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:56	You're not finished.
		끝난게 아니구나
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:59	Is that why you
		brought us all out here
		그래서 우리를
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	in the middle of nowhere?
		아무도 모르는곳에
		데리고 온거야?
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	Massacre number 3?
		3번째 대참사를
		완성하려고?
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	It doesn't work
		that way, Damon.
		그런식이 아냐
		데이먼
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:08	I think you need
		to tell me
		마법의 광천지가 어딘지
		말해야 될것 같은데
00:28:09	 
		마법의 광천지가 어딘지
		말해야 될것 같은데
00:28:09	where this magical
		well is.
		마법의 광천지가 어딘지
		말해야 될것 같은데
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	You know I can't
		do that.
		그럴 수 없는거
		알잖아
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:18	Oh, I know.
		오 잘 알고 있지
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:21	I know.
		알아
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:31	It's getting worse.
		더 심해져
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:35	I'm sorry.
		No.
		-미안해
		-그러지마
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:38	It's my fault.
		I'm sorry.
		내 잘못이야
		내가 미안해
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:42	No. You didn't
		do any of this.
		아냐 네가한게
		아니잖아
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	I unsired the hybrids
		and turned them on Klaus.
		종속을 끊고 클라우스를
		노린건 나잖아
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	I should've just
		left it alone.
		혼자 떠났어야 했는데
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:50	You freed them, Tyler.
		그들을 자유롭게
		해준거야 타일러
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:55	People put their
		faith in you
		사람들은 널
		믿은거고
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	because you're
		a leader.
		네가 리더니까
00:28:58	 
		 
00:29:00	Don't forget that.
		잊지마
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:08	Then you trust me?
		날 믿어볼래?
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:22	You want to be in
		control, Klaus? Here.
		장악하고 싶어
		클라우스? 여깄어
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	Now you get to be in
		control of her life.
		캐롤라인 목숨이나
		장악해봐
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:27	If you want her
		to die, fine.
		그녀가 죽길
		바란다면, 좋아
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:31	But then you
		can sit here
		그렇지만 넌
		여기 앉아서
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:32	and watch her
		die yourself.
		죽는걸 직접
		지켜봐야 될거야
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:44	Nothing personal, love.
		사사로운
		감정은 없어, 러브
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:46	If I kill you,
		that means victory for him.
		널 죽게 놔두면
		저놈이 이기게 되
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:50	Don't worry.
		It won't be long now.
		걱정하지마
		오래걸리진 않을거야
00:29:54	 
		 
00:30:00	Where's the cure?
		치료제 어딨어?
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	Does it matter?
		그게 상관있긴해?
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	I think we both know you'd
		rather just torture me.
		날 고문할거란거
		다 알아
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:07	Torture gives you
		a sense of control,
		고문을 통해
		지배감을 느끼겠지
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	especially with your
		relevance slipping away.
		특히나 네 타당성은
		사라져감에도 말이야
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:11	I look at you.
		Here you are,
		네가 어떤지
		다 알아
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	hours from Elena
		breaking her sire bond.
		몇시간 뒤면 엘레나는
		종속에서 풀리고
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	Start to freak out
		a little bit.
		조금은 겁나겠지
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	Listen, you want my advice?
		Leave. Go.
		충고 해줄까?
		떠나 가버려
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	Don't put yourself
		through this.
		이럴 필요까진 없어
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	Oh!
		Fine. Ok.
		알았어
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	Let's say her feelings for you
		are real.
		그녀가 널 좋아하는게
		진짜라고 하자
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	How does that end?
		She's human. You're a vampire.
		어떻게 끝날까? 그녀는
		인간이고 넌 뱀파잖아
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:30	Stop!
		Mm. It's doomed, Damon.
		그만해
		피할수 없어 데이먼
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	See, you're not
		torturing me, man.
		날 고문하는게
		아니구나
00:30:35	 
		 
00:30:35	You're torturing
		yourself by helping them
		치료제 찾는걸 도우면서
		너 스스로를 고문하는구나
00:30:37	 
		치료제 찾는걸 도우면서
		너 스스로를 고문하는구나
00:30:37	find the cure.
		치료제 찾는걸 도우면서
		너 스스로를 고문하는구나
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	I could kill you.
		널 죽일수도 있어
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	Then no one
		would find it.
		그럼 아무도
		못 찾겠지
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	We've established that
		you can't kill me
		날 죽일수 없는걸로
		합의한거 같은데
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	without sending Bonnie
		off the deep end.
		보니가 죽게 되니까
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	You can leave
		the island.
		약간의 자존심을 가지고
		섬을 떠날수도 있어
00:30:48	 
		약간의 자존심을 가지고
		섬을 떠날수도 있어
00:30:48	Have a modicum
		of self-respect.
		약간의 자존심을 가지고
		섬을 떠날수도 있어
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	Don't stay here and watch Elena
		walk away from you.
		여기서 엘레나가
		널 떠나는걸 보지마
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	Right. Because
		if I'm not here,
		그래 내가 여기 없으면
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	then I can't get
		in between you
		너랑 뭔지 모를
		사일러스에 대한
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	and whatever you're
		planning with Silas.
		계획을 방해하진
		못 할테니까
00:30:58	 
		 
00:31:00	I'm not that easily
		manipulated, Professor.
		날 조종하는건
		그렇게 쉽지 않아 교수님
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:04	And there is one flaw
		in your logic.
		그리고 네 논리에는
		한가지 결함이 있어
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:08	I don't give a crap
		about Bonnie Bennett.
		보니 배넷 따위는
		쥐뿔도 관심없어
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:16	What is wrong
		with you?
		뭐가 문제에요?
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:23	What did you say
		to him?
		뭐라고 했어요?
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:25	Your boyfriend's
		a maniac, Elena.
		네 남자친구는
		미쳤어 엘레나
00:31:27	 
		 
00:31:30	Stop messing
		with my friends.
		내 친구들
		건들이지 마요
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:45	Shane is the only thing
		that's keeping Bonnie safe,
		보니를 안전하게 하는건
		쉐인교수님뿐이에요
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	and you try to kill him?
		그런데 죽이려고
		했어요?
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	And you wonder why
		Bonnie hates you.
		보니가 왜 당신을
		싫어하는지 궁금했죠
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	I don't wonder, Elena,
		because I don't care.
		궁금하지 않아 엘레나
		관심없으니까
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:55	I don't care
		about her.
		보니는 상관없어
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	I don't care about
		some lame-ass
		말도 안되는 치료제도
		관심없어
00:31:58	 
		말도 안되는 치료제도
		관심없어
00:31:58	cure for vampires, either.
		말도 안되는 치료제도
		관심없어
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	How can you say that
		right now?
		어떻게 그런말을 해요?
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:06	Because I don't
		want you to be cured.
		네가 치료되는걸
		원하지 않으니까
00:32:08	 
		 
00:32:12	I'm not fighting with
		you about this anymore.
		더이상 이문제로
		싸우지 않을거에요
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	Being human isn't gonna
		change my feelings for you.
		인간이 된다고해서
		내 감정이 바뀌진 않아요
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	Fine. Say
		they're real.
		좋아 감정이
		진실이라고 하자
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	Say you've become
		human and you still love me.
		인간이 되도
		날 사랑한다고 하자
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	Then what?
		그리고 나서는?
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	You grow old.
		You die.
		나이를 먹고
		죽겠지
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:28	I stay a vampire.
		난 뱀파이어일텐데
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	Face reality, Elena.
		We don't work.
		현실을 직시해 엘레나
		우린 안되
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:35	So, things aren't easy
		쉽지 않다고 해서
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	and you're just gonna
		push me away now?
		지금 날
		밀어내는거에요?
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:41	That's what
		you do, Damon.
		그런식이잖아요
		데이먼
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:43	You think that
		you don't--
		자기가 뭔가를...
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:44	you don't
		deserve something,
		받을만한 가치가
		없다고 생각하잖아요
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	so you ruin it.
		그래서 망치잖아요
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:48	I'm not gonna let you
		pull that this time.
		이번엔 그렇게
		놔두지 않을거에요
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:52	Take the cure with me.
		나와 같이
		치료제를 사용해요
00:32:53	 
		 
00:33:00	That's how much I know
		this is real.
		그 정도로 감정이
		진짜인걸 알아요
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	That's how certain
		I am that
		그만큼이나
		확신해요
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	I'm going to love you
		당신을
		사랑한다는걸요
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	even after this is
		all over.
		이번일이 모두
		끝난뒤에두요
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:09	Take the cure.
		치료제를 사용해요
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:12	Be human with me.
		나와 함께
		인간이 되줘요
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:17	We can be together.
		Grow old together.
		함께 할 수 있고
		늙어갈 수 있어요
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	This doesn't have
		to be hard anymore.
		더이상 힘들지도
		않을거에요
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:27	That's not me, Elena.
		That's Stefan.
		그건 내가 아니야 엘레나
		스테판이지
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:35	I used to miss
		being human.
		인간이었던 때를
		그리워하곤 했는데
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:39	Now I can't think of anything
		more miserable on earth.
		이 세상에서 그보다 더
		비참한게 뭔지 모르겠네
00:33:42	 
		 
00:34:02	Haven't we
		been through here before?
		여기 좀전에
		왔던길 아냐?
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	It all looks
		the same to me.
		나한텐 다
		똑같아보여
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:12	Thanks. But that
		wouldn't have killed me.
		고마워 근데
		저거론 나 안죽는데
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:17	Sorry. Force of habit.
		미안 습관적으로
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:23	Don't be a tease.
		흥분시키지마
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	Elena could be lurking somewhere
		in the woods.
		엘레나가 어슬렁
		거릴수도 있어
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:26	Do you mean
		what you said?
		전에 한말
		진심이야?
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	About a cease-fire?
		휴전에 관한거?
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:33	Why do you all assume
		that I hate Elena so much?
		내가 왜 엘레나를
		싫어한다고 생각해?
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:36	Well, I mean, you did
		run her off a bridge.
		다리에서 떨어지게
		했잖아
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	You all seem to forget
		that Elena's death
		엘레나가 죽는게
		우리가족을 구하는
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	was the only way
		to save my family.
		유일한 방법이었단걸
		잊었나본데
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:42	I did the same thing
		that every one of you
		네가 사랑하는
		사람을 보호하듯이
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	would've done to protect
		the people that you love.
		나도 똑같이 한거야
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	And before you cast me
		as the bad guy,
		날 나쁜놈으로
		생각하기 전에
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:49	maybe you should remember
		that Elena's helped to kill
		엘레나가 일조한
		일을 생각해봐
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	not one but two
		of my brothers.
		한명도 아닌 두명이나
		내 형제를 죽였어
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:55	Maybe we're not
		as different as everyone's
		보이는것처럼
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:56	making us out to be.
		그렇게 다르진
		않을지도 몰라
00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:59	Jeremy's not here.
		I'm going back.
		제레미는 여기 없어
		돌아갈래
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:07	Bonnie?
		보니?
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:20	Where is everyone?
		다 어디갔어?
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	What are you
		talking about?
		무슨소리야?
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	Bonnie is not here
		and Shane's stuff is all gone.
		보니는 여기 없고
		쉐인 물건도 다 없어
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:28	Oh, my God.
		세상에나
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:31	The tombstone's gone.
		묘비도 사라졌어
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:45	If you don't feed me
		your blood, I'll die.
		피를 주지 않으면
		난 죽을거야
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:49	Then you'll die,
		네가 죽으면
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:51	and Tyler will have
		learned his lesson
		타일러도 배우는게
		있겠지
00:35:53	 
		타일러도 배우는게
		있겠지
00:35:53	the hard way.
		타일러도 배우는게
		있겠지
00:35:53	the hard way.
		 
00:35:53	the hard way.
		고생한만큼
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:56	How could you
		do this to him?
		어떻게 타일러한테
		그럴수 있어요?
00:35:59	 
		 
00:35:59	To his mom?
		To me?
		그의 어머니한테도?
		나한테도?
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:03	I'm a thousand years old.
		Call it boredom.
		난 천살이나 먹었어
		따분해서 그런다고 생각해
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	I don't believe you.
		안믿어요
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	Fine. Then maybe
		it's because
		그러던지 어쩌면
		내가
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:12	I'm pure evil,
		사악해서 그런지도
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:14	and I can't
		help myself.
		나도 어쩔수가 없어
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	No. It's because
		you were hurt.
		아니 상처받아서 그래
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:26	Which means
		that there is a part of you
		그말은 곧 인간적인 면이
		있다는거야
00:36:29	 
		그말은 곧 인간적인 면이
		있다는거야
00:36:29	that is human.
		그말은 곧 인간적인 면이
		있다는거야
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:41	How could you possibly
		think that?
		어떻게 그렇게
		생각해?
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:46	Because I've seen it.
		내가 봤으니까
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:52	Because...I've caught
		myself wishing
		네가 저지른
		잔인한 일들을
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:57	that I could forget
		all the horrible
		내가 잊기를
		바랬으니까
00:36:59	 
		내가 잊기를
		바랬으니까
00:36:59	things that you've done.
		내가 잊기를
		바랬으니까
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:04	But you can't.
		Can you?
		근데 잊을수 없었지
		그렇지?
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:12	I know that you're
		in love with me.
		날 사랑하는건
		알아
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:19	And anybody capable
		of love
		사랑을 할수 있는 사람은
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	is capable
		of being saved.
		누구나 구원받을 수 있어
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:34	You're hallucinating.
		환각을 느끼는거야
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:39	I guess I'll never know.
		절대로 알 수 없겠지
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:45	 
		캐롤라인
00:37:46	Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:37:47	Caroline.
		 
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:50	 
		캐롤라인
00:37:50	Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:37:52	 
		 
00:38:22	Mm.
		 
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:31	What are you doing
		in my tent?
		내 텐트에서 뭐해?
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:34	 
		묘비는 어딨어?
00:38:34	Where's the tombstone?
		묘비는 어딨어?
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	What have you done
		with it?
		어떻게 했어?
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	What are you
		talking about?
		무슨 소리야?
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	Like it's not
		bloody obvious?
		너무 뻔한거 아냐?
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	All you people ever do
		is betray me
		너희들은 항상
		날 배신했잖아
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:41	and here you go again.
		또 그러는거잖아
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:44	Let her go.
		She didn't take it.
		놔줘 엘레나가
		가져간게 아냐
00:38:46	 
		 
00:38:50	 
		이게 사실이야?
00:38:50	Was any of this real?
		이게 사실이야?
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:52	Was it just a ploy
		to distract me
		쉐인이 묘비를
		가지고 달아나는동안
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:54	while Shane ran off
		with the tombstone?
		내 주의를 딴데로
		돌리려는거야?
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	You think
		I would do that?
		내가 그럴거라고
		생각해?
00:38:57	 
		 
00:38:57	You think I would
		let some psychopath
		사이코패스가
		치료제를 갖고
00:38:59	 
		 
00:38:59	run off with the cure?
		도망가게
		놔뒀을것같아?
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	Every single moment
		of my last 146 years
		146년동안
		매 순간 순간마다
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	has been ruled by the pain
		of being a vampire.
		뱀파이어인거로
		고통받았어
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:08	And this cure ends that.
		이 치료제가
		그걸 끝낼거야
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	It ends the guilt
		and it ends the suffering.
		죄책감도 끝내고
		괴로움도 끝낼거야
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:14	And you really think
		I would jeopardize that?
		근데 내가 그걸
		위태롭게 할거라 생각해?
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	Fine. You didn't
		take it.
		좋아 네가
		가져간게 아니야
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:19	But that doesn't
		mean I trust her.
		그렇다고 내가
		널 믿는다는건 아냐
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:32	I didn't take it,
		but here.
		내가 가져간게 아냐
		하지만 여기
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:35	Consider this
		a peace offering.
		화해의 의미로
		준다고 생각해
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:38	Don't you get it, Elena?
		모르겠어 엘레나?
00:39:39	 
		 
00:39:39	There is no peace.
		화해따윈 없어
00:39:41	 
		 
00:39:41	We're all screwed.
		우리 모두 망했어
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:42	Exactly, Rebekah.
		We're screwed.
		그래 레베카
		우리 망했어
00:39:44	 
		 
00:39:45	Bonnie's gone.
		보니는 사라지고
00:39:46	 
		 
00:39:46	Shane's got
		the tombstone.
		쉐인은 묘비를 얻었고
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:47	Jeremy's missing
		제레미는 행방불명이야
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	who knows if Damon's
		coming back.
		데이먼은 돌아올련지
		누가 알아
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:51	So, us 3 right here,
		그러니 여기
		우리 3명이
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	this is all
		we've got.
		우리한테
		그것뿐이야
00:39:56	 
		 
00:39:58	So, we're either
		in this together...
		그러니 함께 하던지
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:01	 
		아니면 여기서
		끝이야
00:40:01	or it's over.
		아니면 여기서
		끝이야
00:40:02	 
		 
00:40:03	For all of us.
		우리 모두에게
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:32	Jeremy.
		제레미
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:34	Was a bit of a
		scare yesterday.
		어제는 무서웠지
00:40:35	 
		 
00:40:35	Thanks for fending
		off his attacker.
		공격을 막아줘서
		고마워
00:40:36	Thanks for fending
		off his attacker.
		 
00:40:36	Thanks for fending
		off his attacker.
		공격당했다고?
00:40:37	 
		공격당했다고?
00:40:37	His attacker?
		공격당했다고?
00:40:38	 
		 
00:40:38	Jeremy was attacked
		by an islander.
		섬사람에게
		공격받았어
00:40:39	 
		 
00:40:39	I assumed you were his
		hatchet-flinging guardian angel.
		도끼 던진 수호천사가
		너라고 생각했는데
00:40:42	 
		 
00:40:44	That wasn't me.
		그건 나 아니였어
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:47	Then I guess there's
		somebody else on this island
		그럼 이 섬에
		헌터가 산채로
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:48	who's desperate
		to keep our hunter alive.
		필요한 사람이
		있나보네
00:40:51	 
		 
00:40:51	How did
		I get here?
		내가 여기
		어떻게 온거에요?
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:54	What the hell's
		going on?
		대체 무슨일이에요?
00:40:55	 
		 
00:40:55	I see your locator
		spell worked.
		위치추적이
		제대로 먹혔네
00:40:57	 
		 
00:40:57	The path behind me--
		내 뒤에 흔적이...
00:40:58	 
		 
00:40:58	Magically disappeared?
		마법같이
		사라졌다고?
00:40:59	 
		 
00:40:59	You can thank
		the talents of Massak.
		마삭의 재능에
		감사하도록 해
00:41:01	 
		 
00:41:01	He's a witch.
		마녀거든
00:41:02	 
		 
00:41:03	 
		네가 도망치려 할테니
00:41:03	Should you try to
		escape, he'll ensure
		네가 도망치려 할테니
00:41:05	 
		 
00:41:05	that you never
		find your way back.
		돌아가지 못하게
		확실히 하려고했어
00:41:06	 
		 
00:41:07	 
		이제 다 모였고
00:41:08	So, the gang's all here.
		Silas awaits.
		이제 다 모였고
00:41:10	So, the gang's all here.
		Silas awaits.
		 
00:41:10	So, the gang's all here.
		Silas awaits.
		사일러스가 기다려
00:41:12	 
		 
00:41:20	Uhh! Ohh.
		 
00:41:22	 
		 
00:41:27	You're kidding me.
		말도 안돼
00:41:28	 
		 
00:41:40	 
		5인중 하나구나
00:41:40	You're one of the five.
		5인중 하나구나
00:41:42	You're one of the five.
		 
00:41:43	 
00:41:43	Uhh!
00:41:44
