00:34:26	You said that I could trust you, Stefan.
		나보고 믿으라며
		스테판
00:34:30	You said that I could trust you, Stefan.
		 
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:32	Elena, it's complicated... 
		엘레나
		복잡한 얘기야
00:34:34	Elena, it's complicated... 
		 
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	no, it's not complicated, Damon!
		복잡하지 않아요
		데이먼
00:34:37	no, it's not complicated, Damon!
		 
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	You want to know why? Because... 
		왠줄 알아요?
		왜냐하면
00:34:40	You want to know why? Because... 
		 
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	because he's dead now.
		이 남자는 죽었으니까
00:34:43	because he's dead now.
		 
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:43	You told me to kill him.

00:35:31	Caroline, it's not like that.
		캐롤라인
		그런 거 아냐
00:35:33	Caroline, it's not like that.
		 
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	I keep waiting for you

00:35:35	I keep waiting for you
		to make up some dumb story
		 
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:35	so at least I can call
		you a liar. Is that now?
		그래야 거짓말쟁이라고
		불러줄 수 있으니까
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:38	I'll let you two talk.
		Thank you, how big of you!
		- 둘이 얘기해
		- 거 참 고맙네!
00:35:41	I'll let you two talk.

00:35:41	 
		 
00:35:45	You have to understand... 
		이해 좀 해줘
00:35:47	You have to understand... 
		 
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	no, you don't tell me what I have to do.
		이래라 저래라
		하지마
00:35:49	no, you don't tell me what I have to do.
		 
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:49	I went through hell when I thought
		you died. I cried like an idiot,
		네가 죽은 줄 알았어
		바보처럼 펑펑 울었지
00:35:52	I went through hell when I thought
		you died. I cried like an idiot,
		 
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	and this whole time, you've
		been keeping a secret from me
		근데 지금껏
		애팔래치아에서
00:35:55	and this whole time, you've
		been keeping a secret from me
		 
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	about falling for some
		werewolf in the appalachians!
		늑대인간에 빠진 걸
		비밀로 했잖아
00:35:58	about falling for some

00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	I never fell for her. Oh, please.
		- 빠지지 않았어
		- 웃기네
00:36:00	I never fell for her. Oh, please.
		 
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	Caroline, she saved my life!
		쟤는 날 구해줬어
00:36:03	Caroline, she saved my life!

00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:06	Haley was there for me. She
		helped me get through it.
		내가 그걸 이겨내도록
		헤일리가 도와줬어
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	But nothing else happened!
		다른 일은 없었어
00:36:09	But nothing else happened!
		 
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:09	Then why would Klaus think that?
		클라우스는
		왜 그렇게 생각하는데?
00:36:11	Then why would Klaus think that?
		 
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:11	Because I'd rather him
		사실을 말하는 것 보다
00:36:12	Because I'd rather him
		 
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:12	think that than know the truth.
		그게 더 나으니까
00:36:14	think that than know the truth.
		 
00:36:14

00:36:20	Haley and I can help them.
		헤일리와 내가
		도울 수 있어
00:36:22	Haley and I can help them.
		 
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	But if Klaus found out about
		what we're trying to do,
		클라우스가 그걸
		알게 된다면
00:36:27	But if Klaus found out about
		what we're trying to do,
		 
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	he'd kill us all.
		우릴 죽일거야
00:36:30	he'd kill us all.
		 
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:42	Hey, Jeremy.
		안녕, 제레미
00:36:44	Hey, Jeremy.
		 
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	Sorry we're so late.
		늦어서 미안해
00:36:46	Sorry we're so late.
		 
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	We had to take this crazy detour.
		엄청 둘러서 오느라고
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:48	There was a gas leak.

00:36:49	There was a gas leak.
		 
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:49	Yeah, I heard about that.

		타일리 록우드 집에도
		들렀었는데
00:36:53	Yeah, and we had to stop
		by Tyler Lockwood's house
		 
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	'cause we had to see Caroline.
		캐롤라인 만나서
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:54	We talked to her for a little bit,
		얘기를 좀 했어
00:36:56	We talked to her for a little bit,
		 
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	but now I was thinking maybe
		we could all go get some coffee.
		그럼 이제
		커피 마시러 가면 되겠다
00:37:00	but now I was thinking maybe
		we could all go get some coffee.

		집에 가봐야 겠어
00:37:08	I need to get home anyway,
		 
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:08	'cause I'm feeling a little... 
		그냥 오늘 기분이
00:37:09	'cause I'm feeling a little... 
		 
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:09	Over it today.

00:37:11	Over it today.
		 
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:11	I should probably get home, too.
		나도 집에 가야겠어
00:37:13	I should probably get home, too.
		 
00:37:13

00:38:33	Did you figure out how to tell Klaus
		 
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:33	you lost a hunter and a hybrid?
		클라우스한테
		어떻게 말할거야?
00:38:34	you lost a hunter and a hybrid?
		 
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	He's on a plane.
		비행기에 있어

		어쩌면 존재도 안할
00:38:48	A cure that we don't have, can't find,
		 
00:38:48	 
		 
00:38:48	and probably doesn't exist? You're welcome.

00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:11	Which means there are
		other hunters out there,
		그러니까 다른
		헌터들이 있는거지
00:39:13	Which means there are
		other hunters out there,
		 
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:13	and I'm just going to keep
		looking until I find one.
		만날 때 까지

00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	Sure, Stefan, since you asked,
		물론, 네가
		부탁한다면
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	I'd be happy to go on a
		suicide mission with you
		존재 안할지도 모르는
		치료제를 위한
00:39:20	I'd be happy to go on a

00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:22	Not a problem.
		문제 없어

		하나만 묻자
00:39:33	I just need one thing... 
		 
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:33	why do you want to cure her?
		왜 걜 치료하려고 해?
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	What kind of question is that?
		그게 무슨 말이야?
00:39:38	What kind of question is that?
		 
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:38	Legitimate one.
		논리적으로
00:39:40	Legitimate one.
		 
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	You want to cure her because she's a
		vampire and she's not cut out to be,
		엘레나가 뱀파이어로
		적합하지 못하기 때문이야?
00:39:42	You want to cure her because she's a
		vampire and she's not cut out to be,
		 
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:42	or you can't love her if she is one?
		아니면 인간 엘레나를
		사랑해서야?
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:47	I'll always love her.
		난 항상 사랑해
00:39:49	I'll always love her.
		 
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:49	But she's not supposed to be this person.
		하지만 이럴
		필요는 없잖아
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:52	I don't want her to be.
		이러지 않았으면 해
00:39:54	I don't want her to be.
		 
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:56	Well, if I'm going to ride this
		fairy tale to its conclusion,
		이야기가 모두
		끝나기 전에
00:40:00	Well, if I'm going to ride this
		fairy tale to its conclusion,
		 
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:00	let me be clear about one thing.
		분명히
		덧붙이자면
00:40:01	 
		 
00:40:01	What's that?
		뭔데?
00:40:03	What's that?
		 
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:05	I'm fine with her either way, brother.
		난 두 모습
		다 좋아
00:40:07	I'm fine with her either way, brother.
		 
00:40:07
