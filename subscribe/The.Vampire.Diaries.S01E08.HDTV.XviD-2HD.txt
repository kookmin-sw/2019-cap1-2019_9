		더이상 너와 함께할 수 없어
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	- Five bodies all drained of blood.
		- They've come back.
		- 피가 마른 시체 다섯 구라
		- 그들이 돌아온 겁니다
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	Hello, brother.
		잘 있었니, 동생아
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:24	- She's transitioning.
		- Into what?
		- 변하고 있어
		- 변하다니?
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:26	- A vampire.
		- Vicki, what the hell?!
		- 뱀파이어로
		- 비키, 대체 왜 이래?
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:29	- Why is everybody have to die on me?
		- Can you make him forget?
		- 왜 다들 내 앞에서 죽는거지?
		- 잊어버리게 만들수 있어?
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	I'll do it.
		What do you want him to know?
		내가 할게
		어떤걸 기억하길 바라죠?
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	That Vicki left town, he's gonna misss
		her but he knows it's for the best.

00:01:50	Lexi?
		렉시?
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:53	- Hi.

		- 안녕
		- 여긴 어쩐 일이야?
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	How could you even ask that?
		어떻게 그런 질문을 할 수 있지?
00:01:57

00:02:39	- That was a pretty crazy weekend, huh?
		- We can make him remember us.
		- 정말 광란의 콘서트였잖아?
		- 우리가 기억나게 만들면 되지
00:02:42	 
		 
00:02:44	Come on! Let's go.
		어서 가자
00:02:45

		엘레나야
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	Well, let's hope she's better than

		네가 백년전에 목을 매던

00:02:54

00:03:01	- Where's Damon?
		- Inflicting misery somewhere.
		- 데이먼은 어딨지?
		- 어디선가 불행을 만들고 있겠지
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:06	{\pos(192,220)}You gonna be okay here alone?
		I got some things I gotta take care of.
		혼자 있어도 괜찮겠어?
		처리할 일이 있어서
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	It's not exactly
		like I can go anywhere.
		내가 어딜 나갈 수
		있는 것도 아닌데
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	And you and Damon are the only ones
		with these nifty little daylight rings.
		난 네 둘처럼 멋들어진
		반지가 없거든
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:16	I have a mood ring
		from '75. Trade ya?

00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:19	{\pos(192,230)}Doesn't work that way

		안되는 거 알잖아
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:24	- I'm really glad that you came here.
		- What are we doing
		- 와줘서 정말 기뻐
		- 생일인데 당연하지
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:27	for your birthday? It's not every day
		a guy turns 162 years old.
		특히 162세 아저씨

00:03:30	 
		 
00:03:33	{\pos(192,230)}Really?
		정말?
00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:37	Where did Vicki say she was going?
		비키가 어딜 간다고 했지?
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	- She didn't.
		- Did she tell her brother
		- 얘기 안해줬어요
		- 동생이 너한테
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	{\pos(192,220)}- where she was going?
		- She didn't say anything to me.

		- 아무 말 안했어요
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:44	{\pos(192,220)}She told Jeremy to tell me
		she was leaving town.
		제레미한테 동네를
		떠난단 말을 전하랬죠
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	{\pos(192,220)}Is there anyone I can talk to that
		may know what happened to her prior
		동네를 떠나기 전에
		무슨 일이 있었는지
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	{\pos(192,220)}- to her leaving town?
		- Stefan Salvatore may know.
		- 알만한 사람은 없나?
		- 스테판이 알지 몰라요
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	{\pos(192,220)}He came by the house to see her
		but she wouldn't talk to him.
		비키를 만나러 집에 찾아왔지만
		비키는 얘기를 안 했어요
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	- What was he doing there?
		- I was trying to help her.
		- 무슨 일로 찾아간건가?
		- 비키를 도우려고 했어요
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:57	{\pos(192,220)}I knew that Elena was worried
		about her brother.
		엘레나가 남동생 걱정 하는 걸 알고
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	{\pos(192,220)}He was dating Vicki and she had
		a drug problem, so I tried to help.
		비키와 사귀면서 마약 때문에
		말썽을 일으켜서 도우려 했어요
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:03	{\pos(192,220)}So you got involved
		because Elena asked you to?
		엘레나가 부탁해서
		이 일에 끼어든거니?
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	{\pos(192,220)}I asked Stefan to help.
		스테판한테 도와달라 부탁했어요
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	{\pos(192,220)}I thought that by helping Vicki,
		he was helping my brother.
		비키를 만나면 제 동생도
		바뀔 수 있을까 해서요
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	{\pos(192,220)}What was her behavior like
		those last few days before she left?
		사라지기 며칠 전동안
		이상한 행동은 안했나?
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:13	{\pos(192,220)}Up and down.
		감정 기복이 심했어요
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:15	{\pos(192,220)}Very sketchy, like...
		예민한 상태였어요
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:17	{\pos(192,220)}she was coming down
		from some major party.
		큰 파티에 갔다온 것 처럼
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	- Any signs of aggression or violence?
		- Not that I remember.
		- 공격적이거나 폭력적이진 않았나?
		- 그런 기억은 없어요
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:25	{\pos(192,220)}So you believe
		Vicki really has left town?
		비키가 정말 이 곳을
		떠났다고 생각하나?
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:31	I'll miss her, but...
		그립긴 하지만
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	I think it's for the best.
		최선의 결정인 것 같아요
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:47	I was tryin' to help her, Matt.
		That's all.
		도우려고 했을 뿐야, 맷
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:57	I'll meet you guys at the car.
		차 안에서 봐
00:04:59	 
		 
00:05:06	You okay?
		괜찮니?
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:08	I don't think the sheriff
		suspected anything.
		보안관님이 아무것도
		감지하지 못한 것 같아
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	Jeremy had no memory at all.
		제레미는 하나도 기억을 못했어
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:12	All he knew was what
		Damon made him know.
		데이먼이 주입시킨 것만
		기억하고 있었지
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:16	Thank you.
		고마워
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:18	I can't do this, Stefan.
		못하겠어, 스테판
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:20	Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy,
		맷하고 제레미를 볼 때마다
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	all I think is that
		Vicki is never gonna come back,
		비키는 절대 못 돌아올거란
		생각밖에 안들어
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:26	And they'll never know why.
		이유도 모른채 말야
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	Around you, people get hurt
		and people die and I just...
		네 주위에서 사람들이
		다치고 죽는걸 보는건..
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	It's just too much...
		감당하기 힘들어
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:34	Why don't we go somewhere
		and talk about it?
		어디 가서 얘기 좀 할래?
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:38	You have to stay away from me.
		날 멀리하는 게 좋겠어
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:57	What an unexpected surprise.
		예상치 못한 깜짝선물이군
00:05:59	 
		 
00:06:00	Unexpected surprise?
		예상치 못한 깜짝선물?
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	I think the wrong brother
		went back to high school.
		학교로 돌아가야할 사람은
		따로 있었구만
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	- How long you here for?
		- Just for Stefan's b-Day.
		- 얼마나 있으려고?
		- 스테판 생일 때문에 온거야
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:08	You mean you didn't come
		all this way to see me?
		날 보러 여기까지 온 게 아녔어?
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	That's it, Damon.
		After a century, I finally realized
		그렇지, 데이먼
		한 세기가 지나자 마침내
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:14	death means nothing without you.
		너 없이는 죽음은
		아무 의미 없단 걸 알았어
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	Do me.
		해줘
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:19	Why are you so mean to me?
		왜 이렇게 못되게 구는거야?
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:22	Have you met you?
		You're not a nice person.
		널 직접 못봐서 그래
		너도 착하진 않거든
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:25	- Because I'm a vampire.
		- But you're only the bad parts.
		- 뱀파이어니까
		- 그 중에도 나쁜 뱀파이어지
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	Teach me to be good.
		착해지는 법 좀 가르쳐줘
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:31	I'm older, and that means stronger.
		난 너보다 나이 많아
		더 강하다는 뜻이지
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	- Sorry.
		- Don't ruin my time with Stefan,
		미안 / 스테판과
		보낼 시간 방해하지 마
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:36	cause I'll hurt you.
		가만 안 둘테니
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	And you know I can do it.
		진심인거 알지?
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:51	You leavin'?
		벌써 가게?
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	Dad doesn't like it
		when I stay here too much.
		아버지는 오래 있는걸
		좋아하지 않으셔요
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	Because he misses you,
		or because he doesn't trust me?
		널 그리워해서냐 아님
		널 못 믿어서냐?
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	Your father's problem
		is he lacks imagination.
		네 아버지는 상상력이
		부족한게 문제였어
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	He thinks I fill your head
		with all my witchy juju.
		네 머리를 마녀얘기로
		세뇌시킨 줄 알지
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	- He's right.
		- He's always right.
		- 맞네요
		- 늘 옳았지
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	That's his other problem.
		그것도 문제야
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:09	You need to be wearin' that.
		계속 걸고 있어
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	I gotta get it back to Caroline.
		It doesn't belong to me.
		캐롤라인한테 돌려줘야 해요
		제 꺼가 아니란 말예요
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	Yes, it does. It was your ancestor's
		and now it's yours.
		아니, 네꺼야. 네 조상것이니
		이젠 네 것이나 다름없어
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:17	Emily was your ancestor, too.
		Why don't you wear it?
		에밀리는 할머니 조상이기도 한데
		할머니는 왜 안 거시죠?
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	It didn't find me. It found you,
		protected you.
		날 찾아오지 않았어
		널 찾아 널 보호했잖니
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:23	A witch's talisman
		is a powerful tool.
		마녀의 부적은
		아주 강력하단다
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:26	Don't be givin' that back
		to anybody.
		아무한테도 돌려주지 말거라
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:35	I just wish it was prettier.
		더 예쁜거였음 좋았을텐데
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:41	You're wallowing.
		우울해 하고 있구나
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	So are you.
		이모도 마찬가지잖아
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:45	My wallow is legitimate.
		I was dumped.
		난 그럴만도 해
		남자한테 차였으니까
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:48	- Yeah. Well, Logan's a jerk.
		- You didin't get a brushoff e-mail
		- 그래, 로건 정말 나쁜놈이야
		- 이메일로 퇴짜당한 적 없잖아
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	saying, "I'm leaving town.
		See ya."
		'동네를 떠나기로 했어
		나중에 봐'라고 말이지
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	- Wanna keep it down over there?
		- Why? What are you doing?
		- 좀 조용히 할래?
		- 왜? 뭘 하시길래?
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	Homework.
		숙제
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:59	Since when do you do homework?
		언제부터 네가 숙제를 했다고?
00:08:00	Since when do you do homework?
		네
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	I gotta finish this. I'm way behind
		and I have a quiz tomorrow, so...
		이거 끝내야 해. 내일
		퀴즈가 있는데 뒤쳐저서 말이지
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:07	What do you think?
		Alien?
		뭐 같아? 외계인?
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:10	Some sort of replicant.
		복제 인간 아닐까?
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:13	He can hear you.
		다 들려
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:22	Send him in.
		들여보네
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:26	Mr. Salvatore, come on in.
		살바토어군, 들어오게
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	- Could you get the door for me?
		- Sure.
		- 문 좀 닫아주겠나?
		- 물론이죠
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	I understand from Mrs. Lockwood
		that your uncle's out of town.
		자네 삼촌이 자리를 비운건
		시장님 부인에게 들었네
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:34	Yes, he is.
		But I spoke with Zach.
		맞아요
		삼촌과 연락을 했는데
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	He filled me in and asked
		if I could bring this to you.
		이걸 보안관님께
		드리라고 부탁하더군요
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:52	Vervain.
		마편초군
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	That's all we have at the moment.
		I hope it's enough.
		현재 남은 건 이것밖에 없어요
		충분하길 바래요
00:08:56	 
		 
00:09:01	It's a small circle...
		우리 모임은 소규모야
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:03	Founding families,
		a few city officials.
		설립자 가족들과
		시 공무원들
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	And your deputies, of course, right?
		부서장님도 포함됐죠?
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:10	Are we any closer?
		알아내신 거 있나요?
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:12	I think our facts are wrong.
		우리 예상이 틀린 것 같아
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:15	We've always believed that vampires
		can only come out in the dark.
		뱀파이어는 어두울 때만
		활보할거라고 믿었지
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	What if that's changed?
		바뀌었을지도 몰라
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:21	Is that even possible?
		가능하긴 한건가요?
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	We've exhausted every other option.
		결국 내린 결론이 이거야
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:25	We have to consider the vampire
		may be walking around during the day
		뱀파이어가 대낮에도 활보할
		가능성도 염두해야 된다네
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	right in front of us.
		바로 코 앞에서 말이지
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:34	- So what's the next step?
		- We're now looking at anyone
		- 그럼 다음 단계는 뭐죠?
		- 사람들이 죽기 시작한뒤
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	new to town since the deaths began.
		새로 이사 온 주민들을
		조사 중이라네
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:40	Should turn up a suspect or two.
		용의자 한 두명은 추려질거야
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	And I of course
		will do anything I can to help.
		전 무슨 일이든
		도와드리겠습니다
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:51	{\PUB}You up?
		깨어있어?
00:09:52	 
		 
00:10:00	Why haven't you called me back?
		왜 전화 안한거야?
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:03	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	{\pos(150,268)}Are you gonna stay in there forever?
		여기 영원히 붙어 있으시게?
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:08	Move over.
		비켜봐
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:15	I'm officially worried.
		걱정되기 시작한다
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:18	What's going on?
		무슨 일이야?
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:21	I'm tired of thinking...
		생각하는 게 지겨워
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:24	of talking. I...
		얘기할 생각하는 게
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	Can I get a one-line version so
		I can at least pretend to be helpful?
		그냥 도울 수 있게
		요점만 말해줄래?
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	Stefan and I broke up.
		스테판하고 헤어졌어
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:31	I'm so sorry.
		안됐다
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:33	Are you okay?
		Right. Stupid question.
		괜찮니?
		맞다. 바보같은 질문이네
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:37	I know I've been kind of MIA
		날 가장 필요로 할 때
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:40	when you need me the most.
		곁에 없어서 미안해
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:43	I suck.
		친구 역할 못했지
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	You wanna make it up to me?
		보답하고 싶어?
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	Get my mind off of it.
		다른 생각나게 해줘
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:51	Just remember you asked for it.
		네가 부탁한거다
00:10:53	 
		 
00:11:07	Be patient.
		기다려봐
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:11	I need to swear you to secrecy.
		비밀 지켜주겠다 약속해줘
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	It's kind of a bad week
		for that kind of stuff.
		그런 약속을 하기엔
		참 힘든 한 주였어
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:16	Swear, cause I'm not supposed
		to be showing you this.
		맹세해, 너한테
		보여주면 안되는 거였거든
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	- I swear.
		- There's no windows open, right?
		- 맹세할게
		- 창문 다 닫았지?
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:21	- Right.
		- There's no fan, 
		- 그래
		- 선풍기도 없고
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	- no air conditioning.
		- None. What are you doing?
		- 에어컨도 없고
		- 그래. 뭐하는데?
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	Grams just showed me this.
		You're gonna love it.
		할머니가 보여줬어
		너도 정말 좋아할거야
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	You ready?
		준비됐니?
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:48	Bonnie, what's going on?
		보니, 어떻게 된거야?
00:11:49	 
		 
00:12:17	It's true, Elena,
		사실이야, 엘레나
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:19	Everything my grams told me.
		할머니가 말했던 모든거
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	It's impossible,
		불가능해
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:23	But it's true.
		하지만 사실이야
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:26	I'm a witch.
		난 마녀야
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:30	I believe you.
		난 널 믿어
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:40	Look, dungeon boy,
		I'm done being your little slave girl.
		데이먼, 난 네
		노예처럼 사는데 질렸어
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	You seriously hurt me
		and I will be damned if you think...
		날 심하게 상처줬어
		혹시 착각을 하나본데...
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:50	Oh, my God.
		Where have you been?
		세상에. 어디 있었어?
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:54	- It's really good to see you.
		- Much better.
		- 만나서 정말 반갑다
		- 훨씬 낫네
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	You wanna throw a party
		here at the Grill tonight.
		그릴 레스토랑에서
		파티를 열고 싶지 않니?
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	Why don't you do it?
		오빠가 열지 그래?
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	Because then Stefan and his BFF
		won't come. I need a lot of people,
		그럼 스테판과 절친이 못오거든
		난 많은 사람이 필요해
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	big crowd. Invite everyone.
		많은 관중이
		모두 초대해줘
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	And why am I having this party?
		내가 왜 파티를 여는거라고?
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	Because you are gonna help me solve
		this town's little vampire problem.
		이 동네의 뱀파이어 문제를
		해결하기 위해 도와줘야 해
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:13	- And I want my crystal back.
		- But Bonnie has it.
		- 수정구슬도 되찾고
		- 보니가 갖고 있는걸
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:17	I know that.
		알아
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	Get it from her.
		뺏어와
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:22	So, this Elena girl,
		she'll come around. I'm sure of it.
		엘레나는 돌아올거야
		믿어봐
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:26	Have you had sex yet?
		아직 같이 안잤니?
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Sex always works.
		자고 나면 효과가 있는걸
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:30	You'll rock her world so hard
		with your vamp sex,
		뱀파이어만의 매력으로
		그녀의 세상을 흔드는거야
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	- She'll be yours forever.
		- Yeah, but see, this isn't about
		- 영원히 네 여자가 될거야
		- 그래, 하지만 이건
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	sex or... or compulsion
		섹스나 강한 욕망이나
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	or any of our other tricks.
		다른 마법 때문이 아냐
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	She has to want
		to be with me on her own terms.
		그녀가 직접 날 원해야 되지
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:44	That sounded
		all mature and grown-up.
		아주 성숙한 어른같은 소릴 하시네
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	I'm not getting any older.
		나이는 안 먹는걸
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:57	Want some?
		먹을래?
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:59	Thank you.
		됐어
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:01	Relax. I didn't kill anyone for it.
		진정해. 죽이진 않았어
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	This phlebotomist I went out
		with a few times, he's my supplier.
		내가 데이트 몇번 했던
		지혈자가 공급해줬지
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:08	Don't judge, okay?
		비난하지 마
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	Listen, I tried the animal diet.
		Lasted 3 weeks.
		나도 동물 피만 마셔봤는데
		3주만에 질리더라
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:13	Doesn't matter.
		Cause if I started again...
		상관 없어
		다시 시작하면..
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	- I don't know if...
		- You could stop.
		- 모르겠어
		- 그만둬
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:22	- I'd never judge you.
		- I'm just jealous of your restraint.
		- 비난 안해
		- 네 자제력이 샘나
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	I have none.
		I delight in hedonism.
		나한텐 자제력이 없거든
		쾌락주의를 즐기지
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	Speaking of which,
		그 얘기가 나와서 말인데
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	- What are we doing tonight?
		- Funny you should ask.
		- 오늘 밤에 뭐 할거야?
		- 그걸 묻는다니 웃기네
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:34	Well, I wasn't asking you.
		너한테 물은 거 아니거든
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:36	There's a party
		at the Grill. You'll love it.
		그릴 레스토랑에서
		파티가 있어. 좋아할거야
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	Banquettes, tacky wait staff.
		붙박이 의자와
		특이한 웨이터들과
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	All of Stefan's friends.
		스테판 친구들
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	- I don't want a birthday party.
		- Well, it's not for you.
		- 생일 파티 하고 싶지 않아
		- 널 위한 파티가 아냐
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	It's a party party. No one's
		gonna know it's your birthday.
		그냥 파티일 뿐야. 아무도
		네 생일인줄 모를거야
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	- Caroline's throwing it.
		- Damon, stay away from Caroline.
		- 캐롤라인이 주최했거든
		- 데이먼, 캐롤라인한테서 물러나
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	We're friends. It's cool.
		우린 친구야. 쿨한 관계지
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	It's important for the town to see us
		out and about like normal folk.
		동네 사람들이 우리가 평범한
		주민들과 어울리는 걸 봐야해
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	We need to blend.
		좀 섞여 지낼 필요가 있지
00:14:57	 
		 
00:15:02	I prefer mine at 98.6.
		난 98.6도 짜리가 좋던데
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:08	Let's go.
		어서 가자
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:12	Please?
		제발?
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:14	It's weird, huh? After all this time
		joking about being psychic,
		이상하지? 영매에
		대해서 농담을 했는데
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	I really am a witch.
		내가 정말 마녀라니
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:23	You don't think
		I'm a freak now, do you?
		이젠 내가 괴물로 보이지 않아?
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	No. Of course not.
		물론 아냐
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:27	I just... I don't understand, though.
		If your grams asked you
		난.. 이해가 안될뿐야
		할머니가 너한테
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	to keep all this a secret,
		why did you tell me?
		비밀을 지키라고 했는데
		왜 나한테 얘기한거야?
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	You're my best friend.
		내 단짝친구니까
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:34	I can't keep secrets from you.
		너한테 숨길 수 없지
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:42	I'm almost ready.
		준비 다 됐어
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	Can't believe you actually think
		that we should go to this thing.
		정말 이 파티에
		갈거라고 생각하다니
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	It's not like I'm asking you to run
		outside midday without your ring.
		대낮에 반지 빼고 밖에
		돌아다니라 부탁한것도 아닌데
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	I mean, seriously, it's a party.
		진짜, 그냥 파티일 뿐이라고
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	A party that Damon wants us to go to,
		you know. So my question is,
		데이먼이 가길 원하는 파티지
		내가 궁금한 건
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	- "why?" I think he's up to something.
		- Who cares?
		- 뭔가 꿍꿍이가 있을거란 거지
		- 누가 신경 쓴데?
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:57	I mean, what can he possibly do in front
		of all those people in a public place?
		공공 장소와 많은 사람들
		앞에서 뭘 할수 있겠어?
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	He knows how to keep
		a low profile, believe me.
		묻어가는 방법을 잘 알거든
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	So he'll behave.
		Come on. One day a year, I get you,
		그럼 조심스럽게 행동하겠네
		일년에 하루 뿐이라고
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	One day that you're not brooding
		하루만 근심 걱정 말고
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	and existing in your own head.
		즐겁게 노는 거야
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:12	- It's my birthday, yeah?
		- It's my day, and that guy
		- 내 생일이지?
		- 내 날이야, 그리고
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	That jumped naked
		in the Trevi Fountain and
		트레비 호수에
		옷을 벗고 점프한 남자
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	got drunk on the Torch
		of the Statue of Liberty, That guy
		자유의 여신상 햇불 위에
		술취해 서있던 남자
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	can take a break from all
		of his worrying for one night
		그 남자는 하루만
		근심 걱정은 잊고
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	and go to a stupid party.
		So quit your whining...
		바보같은 파티에 가야 한다구
		그러니까 그만 징징대셔
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:28	and go get ready.
		갈 준비하고
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:32	Fine.
		알겠어
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:48	@@/It's open. Come on in.@@\
		열렸어요, 들어와요
00:16:50	 
		 
00:17:01	How...
		어떻게..
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:06	- Who...
		- I'm Elena.
		- 누구...
		- 엘레나에요
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:09	- Who are you?
		- Lexi.
		- 그쪽은?
		- 렉시에요
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:12	A friend of Stefan's.
		스테판 친구죠
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:15	- Is he here?
		- He's in the shower.
		- 스테판 있나요?
		- 샤워중이에요
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:19	Do you wanna wait?
		기다릴래요?
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:22	I'll tell him you stopped by.
		들렀다고 전할게요
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	That's okay.
		괜찮아요
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:32	Are you out of your freaking mind?
		대체 정신을 어따 둔거야?
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:35	What are you talking about?
		무슨 말이야?
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:38	I just met Elena.
		방금 엘레나 만났어
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:42	You have some serious
		explaining to do.
		너 정말 진지하게
		설명 좀 해야겠다
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:49	{\Pub}You have some serious
		emotional damage.
		정말 심각하게 상처 받았구나
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:52	It's not what you think.
		She's not Katherine.
		누나 생각과 달라
		캐더린이 아냐
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	Then they're related
		because they could be twins.
		그럼 혈연 관계인가봐
		쌍둥이 같거든
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	- I don't know.
		- You don't know.
		- 모르겠어
		- 모르겠다
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	- You didn't find out?
		- No. Maybe I don't wanna know.
		- 안 알아냈어?
		- 응. 알고싶지 않나봐
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	I have no desire
		to tie Elena to Katherine.
		엘레나와 캐더린을
		엮고 싶지 않아
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:07	The resemblance is what
		drew me in but that's it.
		닮은 외모 때문에 끌렸지만
		그게 다야
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	Katherine and Elena may look
		the same on the outside,
		캐더린과 엘레나가
		외면적으론 닮았을지 몰라도
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	But on the inside,
		they are completely different.
		내면을 알고 보면
		전혀 달라
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	So Elena's not
		a raging bitch then, huh?
		엘레나는 미친듯 날뛰는
		나쁜년이 아니란 소리네?
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:24	No, Elena is...
		그래, 엘레나는..
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:28	Elena's warm,
		따뜻하고
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:30	And she's...
		엘레나는..
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:32	She's kind and she's caring
		and she's selfless,
		착하고 상냥하고
		이기심 없어
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:37	and it's real.
		정말이야
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:39	And...
		그리고..
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:41	honestly, when I'm around her...
		사실, 그녀 곁에 있으면
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	I completely forget what I am.
		내 존재를 잊게 돼
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:49	You're in love with her.
		사랑에 빠졌구나
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:56	Yeah, I am.
		응, 그래
00:18:57	 
		 
00:19:23	Amazing party, right?
		파티 참 멋지지?
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	Glad you thought of it.
		파티 열어줘서 고마워
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:28	- Well, are you having a good time?
		- Do you have my crystal?
		- 즐거운 시간 보내고 있어?
		- 내 수정구슬 가져왔어?
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:34	Then I'm not having a good time.
		즐거운 마음 싹 가시네
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:47	- Where's my brother?
		- He said he'd meet me here.
		- 스테판은 어디있어?
		- 여기서 보쟀는데
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	Buy you a...
		내가 한 잔..
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:59	What are you doing rere?
		여긴 왠 일이야?
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:01	Lexi said that you came by
		and you seemed upset.
		렉시가 그러길 네가
		당황한 표정으로 들렀다던데
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:05	Right.
		맞다
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:07	The girl in the towel.
		타올두른 여자분
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	The towel?
		타올이라고?
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:16	Not like that. No.
		She's not exactly a girl. Lexi's...
		그런 게 아냐
		여자라고 볼 수 없지,렉시는..
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:20	She's 350 years old.
		350살이야
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:23	You mean she's a...
		그러니까
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	And she's my oldest friend.
		제일 나이 많은 친구지
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	Nothing romantic.
		로맨틱과는 거리가 멀어
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:29	Ever.
		전혀
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:33	Okay, well...
		그럼..
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	she kept staring at me.
		It was weird.
		날 자꾸 쳐다보더라
		이상했어
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:39	Well, you know,
		I've talked about you
		있지, 너에 대해
		얘길 해줬어
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:41	a lot, so...
		정말 많이. 그러니까..
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:43	guess she felt like she knew you.
		널 알고 지내는 것처럼
		느껴졌나봐
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:48	So why'd you come by?
		근데 왜 들른거야?
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:53	It was a mistake.
		실수였어
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:59	- Elena, talk to me.
		- I can't.
		- 엘레나, 말해봐
		- 말 못하겠어
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:03	Stefan, I can't
		and that's the problem.
		스테판, 말을 못하는게 내 문제야
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:06	I'm keeping all these secrets
		from everyone.
		모든 사람들한테
		비밀을 숨기고 있어
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	I can't even tell my best friend.
		단짝 친구한테도 말을 못하지
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	Do you know how hard that is?
		그게 얼마나 힘든줄 알아?
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:13	It's like I need to talk to someone
		but the only person I can talk to is
		누구한테 얘기하고 싶은데
		얘기할 수 있는 유일한 사람은
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	you... and...
		너 밖에 없는 것 같아
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:23	I want you to know
		알아주길 바래
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:25	that I will always be here for you.
		무슨 일이든 도와줄게
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:29	You can come to me
		about anything, okay?
		어떤 일이든
		날 찾아와도 되
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:36	Well, thank you for coming by.
		들러줘서 고마워
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:49	Do you need a ride
		to the Grill tonight?
		레스토랑까지
		타고 갈 차 필요하지?
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:51	- Are you going to Caroline's party?
		- Lexi's dragging me.
		- 캐롤라인이 여는 파티 가게?
		- 렉시가 끌고 가는 거라서
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:56	And...
		게다가..
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:58	it's my birthday.
		내 생일이거든
00:21:59	 
		 
00:22:01	Really?
		정말?
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:04	- Happy birthday then.
		- Thank you.
		- 생일 축하해
		- 고마워
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:08	Actually, I...
		사실 난..
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:11	I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.
		오늘밤 집에 있을래
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:22	Well, have... have a good night.
		그럼 저녁 즐겁게 보내
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:45	I've been looking for you.
		널 찾아 다녔잖아
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:47	I'm totally sorry to do this.
		I know it's so indian giver,
		정말 미안해
		줬다 뺐은 격이지
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	and we're not even supposed
		to say that anymore, but
		그런 말 쓰면 안되지만
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:53	- I need my crystal back.
		- Why? You said you hated it.
		- 목걸이 돌려줘
		- 왜? 실증났다면서
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:57	Then I saw it on you
		and I realized how great it is.
		근데 네가 걸은 걸 보니
		정말 예쁜 걸 깨달았어
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:00	And I've got, like, three outfits
		I can coordinate it with, so...
		그러니까 난 그 목걸이와
		코디할 의상이 3개나 되고...
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	I can't give it back to you.
		돌려줄 수 없어
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:08	Well, I didn't want
		to have to tell you this,
		이런 말 하고 싶지 않았는데
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:10	but I'm your friend.
		네 친구니까 말해줄게
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:13	When you wear it,
		it makes you look fat.
		네가 걸고 있으면
		뚱뚱해 보여
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	There. I said it, but
		it's because I'm your friend, so...
		말해버렸네, 하지만
		난 네 친구니까...
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	I'm sorry. Caroline, I can't.
		미안해, 캐롤라인
		돌려줄 수 없어
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	What do you mean
		that you can't, Bonnie? It's mine.
		돌려줄 수 없다니?
		내꺼잖아, 보니
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:24	- I thought you said it was Damon's.
		- It is.
		- 데이먼 꺼라고 했었잖아
		- 그래
00:23:26	 
		 
00:23:26	So he's the one
		who really wants it back?
		그럼 사실은 데이먼이
		돌려달라 했던거야?
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:31	Maybe. Just...
		아니, 그게...
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:35	Are you wearing polyester?
		폴리에스테르 옷 입었니?
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	You were really gonna pull it
		from my neck?
		정말 내 목에서
		떼어내 가려고?
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:40	What the hell is wrong with you?
		대체 왜 이래?
00:23:42	 
		 
00:24:00	Just hear me out?
		Please?
		내 얘기 좀 들어줘
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	I was just trying to help Vicki.
		비키를 도와주려고 했었어
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	I went through
		something similar once.
		나도 비슷한 일을 겪었거든
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:10	I'm really sorry.
		정말 미안해
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:12	Don't be.
		It's not the first time she's run off.
		미안해하지 마
		가출한건 이번이 처음은 아니니까
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:16	Turns out
		Vicki's just like her mother.
		알고 보니
		비키도 엄마랑 똑같더라
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:19	I can't count on either of them.
		둘 다 믿을 수가 없지
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:23	Thanks for trying.
		시도는 고마워
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:32	Where is it?
		어디 있어?
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	Bonnie won't give it to me.
		보니가 주질 않아
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	So rip it off her neck.
		그냥 떼어내지 그랬어
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	I tried. It shocked me.
		그러려고 했는데
		전기가 일어났어
00:24:38	 
		 
00:24:39	Damn it.
		Why does it do that?
		젠장. 왜 그런거야?
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:42	- I need that crystal.
		- Why are you being like this?
		- 그 수정이 필요해
		- 왜 이런식으로 나오는 거야?
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	I'm so good to you
		and I'd do anying.
		너한테 잘해주고
		다 들어주려 하는데
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:49	It's just some stupid necklace.
		바보같은 목걸이 가지고
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:53	You are the only stupid thing here.
		너야말로 바보 같아
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:56	And shallow.
		가볍기도 하지
00:24:57	 
		 
00:24:58	And useless.
		쓸모 없고
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:05	Okay, I'm gonna need
		a little more foot movement.
		발을 좀 더 움직여야 겠는데
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	Yeah, I'm not really interested
		in making a fool out of myself.
		난 별로 바보짓 하고 싶지 않다
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	Come on. You're not that bad.
		왜 그러셔
		그리 못추진 않아
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:13	Do me a favor. Tell me if you see
		Damon with his camera phone.
		부탁 좀 들어줘, 데이먼이
		디카 들고 있으면 말해줘
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:16	Right.
		그러셔
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:24	@@/- Where are we going?
		- No one's gonna see us...@@\
		- 어디 가게?
		- 아무도 못 볼거야
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:50	- Did you hear something?
		- No. It's cool.
		- 무슨 소리 못들었어?
		- 아니, 괜찮아
00:25:52	 
		 
00:25:53	There's no one coming down here.
		아무도 여기까진 안내려와
00:25:55	 
		 
00:26:08	{\PUB}Nice!
		나이스!
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:33	Stefan smiles.
		스테판이 웃다니
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:35	Alert the media.
		경보를 울려야 겠네
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	You haven't given him
		a lot of reasons to be happy lately.
		요즘에 당신 때문에
		웃을 일이 없었잖아요
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:40	You're right. Poor Stefan.
		맞다. 불쌍한 스테판
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:43	Persecuted throughout eternity
		by his depraved brother.
		사악한 형 때문에
		영원히 박해 받다
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:50	Does it get tiring
		being so righteous?
		정의롭게만 사는 거
		질리지 않나요?
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:53	It flares up
		in the presence of psychopaths.
		사이코패스가 존재할때는
		빛을 발하는 걸요
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	Well, consider
		this psychopath's feelings hurt.
		사이코패스 마음을
		아프게 하는군요
00:26:59	 
		 
00:27:01	What did you do to my brother?
		내 동생한테 무슨 짓을 한거죠?
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	I'm gonna need
		a less vague question.
		질문을 분명하게 해줘요
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	When you did what you did
		to Jeremy's memory of Vicki,
		제레미의 비키에 대한
		기억을 지우고 나서
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	- What else did you do to him?
		- You asked me
		- 또 무슨 짓을 한거죠?
		- 나한테 부탁했죠
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	to take away
		his memory of fangs and...
		뱀파이어에 연관된
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	and all the bad stuff.
		나쁜 기억을 없애달라고
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:17	You wanted me
		to take away his suffering.
		고통을 앗아가주길
		바란 거였잖아요
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	But he's acting different.
		근데 요즘 행동이 달라졌어요
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:21	He seems okay with everything
		and a little too okay.
		이젠 괜찮아 보이는데
		지나치게 괜찮아 보이죠
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:23	I mean, he's studying. He's not
		doing drugs. He's not drinking.
		공부를 해요. 마약도
		술도 안하고 말이죠
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:27	Are you sure
		you didn't do something else?
		다른 주문을 걸지는
		않은거 확실해요?
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	I took away his suffering.
		고통을 지웠을 뿐예요
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:35	- Don't talk to me.
		- Don't do that. Let me explain.
		- 말하지 마
		- 그러지 마, 설명할게
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:38	What is there to explain?
		You got what you wanted...
		설명할게 뭐 있어?
		내가 원하는게 너한테 있는데
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	And something that doesn't even
		belong to you, by the way.
		네 것도 아닌데 말야
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	And I get called a shallow,
		useless waste of space.
		가볍고 쓸모짝도
		없다는 소리나 듣고
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	- Who said that to you?
		- Who do you think?
		- 누가 그랬어?
		- 누구 같아?
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	You know that's not true.
		Don't let him treat you like that.
		그건 사실이 아닌거 알잖아
		그런 식으로 대하지 못하게 해
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	As opposed to how
		my best friend treats me.
		내 친한 친구들은
		극진한 대접을 해주셔서?
00:27:55	 
		 
00:28:28	Two shots of tequila.
		테킬라 두 잔 주세요
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:35	Make that three.
		세 잔으로 줘요
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:38	I need to see some ID.
		신분증 좀 보여주시죠
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	No, you don't.
		그럴 필요 없어요
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:46	- That'll be...
		- Free.
		- 세 잔 합쳐서...
		- 공짜죠
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	- On the house.
		- Thanks.
		- 제가 쏩니다
		- 고마워요
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:58	The famous Elena.
		유명한 엘레나 양이군요
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:01	Towel girl.
		타올 둘렀던 여자분이네요
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:04	I've been called worse.
		Here.
		더 심한 말도 들었으니
		여기요
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:07	I didn't know
		that you guys could drink.
		술도 마실 수 있는지 몰랐어요
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:10	Yeah. It helps curb the cravings,
		식욕 억제에 도움이 되죠
00:29:12	 
		 
00:29:12	But makes for a lot of lushy vamps.
		술취하면 큰일날때도 있지만
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:16	I've never seen Stefan drunk.
		스테판이 술취한 건
		못 봤어요
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:19	- He always seems so...
		- Uptight?
		- 스테판은 참...
		- 늘 긴장 한다구요?
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:24	But not with you.
		그쪽하고 있을땐 달라요
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:26	That's the benefit of knowing
		someone for over 100 years.
		그거야 100년 넘게
		알고 지내서 좋은점이죠
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	You can just be yourself.
		본모습을 보여줄 수 있으니
00:29:30	 
		 
00:29:32	- He can't be himself with me.
		- Well, not yet.
		- 나하고 있을땐 그렇지 않아요
		- 아직까지는 아니죠
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:34	The first step was him telling you.
		처음엔 스테판이
		얘기를 털어놓았죠
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	The rest comes with time.
		나머지는 시간이 흐르면서
		알게 될거에요
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:40	You seem so sure.
		확신하는 눈치네요
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:44	The love of my life was human.
		제가 평생 사랑한 사람은
		인간이었어요
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:47	He went through what
		I imagine you're going through...
		그쪽이 지금 겪고 있을 일들을
		겪어 낸 사람이죠
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:51	Denial, anger, et cetera.
		부인, 분노 같은 감정을요
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:54	But at the end of the day,
		하지만 결국에
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:57	love really did conquer all.
		사랑은 정말
		모든걸 정복하더군요
00:29:59	 
		 
00:30:04	Are you gonna drink that?
		그거 마실거에요?
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:07	Go for it.
		드세요
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:12	I'm scared.
		두려워요
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:15	But you're here...
		하지만 여기까지 왔잖아요
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:17	cause you're crazy about him.
		정말 스테판을
		사랑해서 그러는 거에요
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	I get it, okay? I mean,
		이해해요
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:22	what's not to love?
		스테판을 사랑하지
		않을 이유가 뭐가 있어요?
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	Listen.
		들어봐요
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	Take it from someone
		who's been around a long time.
		정말 오랜 인생을 산 사람의
		경험에서 나오는 말인데
00:30:28	 
		 
00:30:29	When it's real, you can't walk away.
		감정이 진실하다면
		그냥 물러날 수 없는거에요
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:41	It was really nice meeting you.
		만나서 반가웠어요
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:53	Yep, I drank yours.
		그래, 네 것도 마셨다
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:55	Sorry.
		미안
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:58	Thank you.
		고마워
00:30:59	 
		 
00:31:01	You weren't supposed
		to be listening.
		넌 들어선 안되는 거였는데
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:06	I was feeling epic.
		장중한 기분이 들었거든
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:07	Whatever.
		아무렴 상관없어
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:21	Keep this contained.
		증거 보관해놓게
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:23	That's not all.
		그 뿐이 아녜요
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:37	Did you see what did this?
		무엇이 이렇게 만들었는지 봤니?
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:43	Tell me everything you saw.
		네가 본 모든 걸 얘기해주렴
00:31:45	 
		 
00:32:01	{\PUB}You came.
		왔구나
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:03	{\pos(150,268)}I couldn't miss your hundredth and...
		whatever birthday.
		네 백 몇십살 생일을
		놓칠 수야 없으니까
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:20	I slim... I'm slipped.
		내가 미끄러졌네
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:24	I slipped.
		넘어졌지
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	Hammered, huh?
		강조하는구나?
00:32:26	 
		 
00:32:28	Well...
		그게...
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	a very nice but not handsome
		친절하지만 별로 잘생기지 않은
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	bartender
		was very kind to me tonight.
		바텐더가 나한테
		잘해주더라고
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:37	Unlike the rest
		of the global humanverse.
		다른 인간 종족들과
		다르게 말이지
00:32:40	 
		 
00:32:42	Are those curly fries?
		저거 감자 후라이야?
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:45	Coffee for the drunk girl.
		술취했으니 커피 주세요
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:50	Bad night, huh?
		힘든 하루였니?
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:53	Baddest.
		가장 최악의 날이었어
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:56	Am I shallow?
		내가 가볍니?
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:58	- Is that a trick question?
		- I don't mean to be.
		- 농담하는거지?
		- 아니 진심이야
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:02	I wanna be deep.
		난 속깊은 사람이 되고싶어
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:04	I wanna be, like...
		그러니까..
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	the abyss deep.
		끝없이 깊은 사람
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:10	No offense, Care, but
		deep's really not your scene.
		나쁜 뜻은 아니고, 속깊은
		모습은 너한테 어울리지 않아
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:15	That's true.
		사실이야
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:18	I'm shallow.
		난 천박해
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:20	I am worse than shallow.
		천박보다 심하지
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:23	I'm a kiddie pool.
		정말 심하게 얕지
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:25	You're not a kiddie pool.
		넌 가볍지 않아
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:28	You're not a kiddie pool.
		천박하지 않다고
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:31	Can I just go home?
		그냥 집에 가도 될까?
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:35	I'll take you. Come on.
		내가 데려다줄게
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:44	You're okay. She's all right.
		Hold still. Hold still.
		괜찮아. 괜찮아요
		가만히 있어
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:57	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:33:59	 
		 
00:33:59	- Is she okay?
		- Like you care.
		- 괜찮아?
		- 신경쓰시는 척 하지마요
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	- She's drunk?
		- As a skunk.
		- 술 취했니?
		- 심하게 취했죠
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	Are they serving you in there?
		안에서 미성년자한테
		술을 제공한거야?
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:06	I'll take her home. It's on my way.
		I haven't been drinking.
		제가 데려갈게요. 저희 집 쪽이라
		전 술 안 마셨거든요
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:10	I would appreciate that, Matt.
		Thank you.
		그럼 고맙지, 맷
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:13	You and I will discuss this later.
		넌 나랑 집에서 얘기하자
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:15	Can't wait.
		기대되네요
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:21	Don't let anybody else leave.
		나머지 사람들은
		못 나가게 하게
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:28	All right, the shots are a bribe.
		I need you to answer a question.
		뇌물로 주는 거야
		질문에 대답 좀 해줘
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:33	What are you really doing
		in Mystic Falls?
		미스틱 폴즈는 정말
		무슨 일로 온 거야?
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	Have you tried the Brittle?
		It wins awards.
		브리틀엔 못 가봤어?
		상도 탔다던데
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	Cut the crap.
		헛소리는 집어쳐
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:44	I have a diabolical master plan.
		극악무도한 계획이 있거든
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:48	What is it?
		그게 뭔데?
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:49	Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be
		very diabolical, would it?
		말을 해주면 그건 극악무도한
		계획이 되지 못할거야, 그치?
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:54	Look around.
		Let me know if you see him.
		주변을 둘러보고
		범인을 보면 말해주게
00:34:56	 
		 
00:35:31	What are you doing?
		뭐 하시는 거에요?
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	Thank you for the vervain.
		Now if you'll excuse me.
		마편초는 고마웠어
		실례 좀 해주게
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:42	What is it?
		저게 뭐야?
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:46	Excuse me. Sorry.
		실례해요
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:52	Can't go out this way.
		이쪽으론 나갈수 없네
00:35:53	 
		 
00:36:30	Why?
		왜 이러는 거야?
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:32	It's part of the plan.
		내 계획의 일부거든
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:49	You okay?
		괜찮으세요?
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:52	Thank you.
		고맙네
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:56	Get it in the car quickly.
		빨리 차에 타게
00:36:58	 
		 
00:37:02	{\PUB}Lady, I checked everyone's ID.
		보안관님, 신분증 다 확인했다구요
00:37:04	 
		 
00:37:04	Apparently you didn't.
		빼먹은 사람이 있었잖나
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:12	Pretty handy with that stake.
		재빠르게 찌르던데
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:14	{\pos(150,268)}It just... reflex. I guess the
		반사 작용이었나봐요
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:17	{\pos(150,268)}adrenaline kicked in.
		나도 모르게 자극이 되서
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:19	This nightmare is finally over.
		이곳의 악몽은 마침내 끝났어
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:22	Caught a lucky break with that witness.
		Without her, you wouldn't have been
		목격자를 잡는 행운까지 생겨서
		안 그랬다면
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	- able to ID the vampire.
		- Very lucky.
		- 뱀파이어를 못찾았을거에요
		- 아주 운이 좋았지
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:30	Well, thank you again.
		정말 고맙네
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:34	You're welcome.
		별 말씀을
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:59	You gonna be okay?
		괜찮겠어?
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:11	Do you ever feel like there's not
		너 이세상 사람들 중
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:14	a person in the world
		that loves you?
		널 사랑하는 사람은 한명도
		없는 듯한 기분 아니?
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:18	Life can be a little rough.
		인생은 힘들 때가 있어
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:21	I just wish...
		난 그저...
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:24	What?
		뭐?
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:26	Wish that life was...
		내 인생이..
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:31	different.
		달랐으면 해
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:33	Yeah. Me, too.
		나도 그래
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:44	Please...
		제발..
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:48	don't leave me alone.
		날 혼자두고 가지 마
00:38:49	 
		 
00:39:14	He killed her.
		데이먼이 렉시를 죽였어
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	He killed Zach.
		잭도 죽였고
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	He killed Tanner. He turned Vicki.
		태너 선생님도 죽였어
		비키를 뱀파이어로 만들었고
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:19	I have to kill him.
		이젠 내가 그를 죽여야 해
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	No. You can't do that.
		안 돼, 그럴 순 없어
00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:23	Why are you trying to save him?
		왜 구해주려 하는 거야?
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:25	He's never gonna change.
		Don't you see that?
		절대 변하지 않아
		모르겠어?
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	- He's never gonna change.
		- I'm not trying to save him.
		- 절대 바뀌지 않을거야
		- 구해주려는 게 아냐
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	I'm trying to save you. You have no
		idea what this will do to you. Please.
		널 구하려고 하는거지. 그럼 상황이
		어떻게 될지 넌 몰라서 그래
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:33	Everywhere that I go,
		pain and death follow.
		내가 어딜 가든지
		고통과 죽음이 따라와
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:36	Damon follows me.
		데이먼이 날 쫓아오지
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	No more.
		더 이상 안되겠어
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:39	Please. Please, just talk to me.
		Let me be here for you. Talk to me.
		제발 나한테 털어놔
		내가 도와줄게. 말해봐
00:39:43	 
		 
00:39:47	You were right to stay away from me.
		널 멀리해야 된다는
		네 말이 옳았어
00:39:50	 
		 
00:40:08	Told you I'd take care of it.
		내가 처리하겠다고 했지
00:40:10	 
		 
00:40:28	Come on. I did this for you
		to get them off our trail.
		왜 이래, 우리 흔적을
		추적하지 못하게 만든거야
00:40:31	 
		 
00:40:31	You never do anything
		for anyone but yourself.
		형은 늘 자기 자신을
		위한 짓만 해왔잖아
00:40:33	 
		 
00:40:41	You missed.
		빗맞쳤어
00:40:42	 
		 
00:40:44	You saved my life.
		날 살려줬으니
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:45	I'm sparing yours.
		나도 살려준거야
00:40:47	 
		 
00:40:48	We're even.
		이제 공평해졌네
00:40:49	 
		 
00:40:50	And now we're done.
		끝났어
00:40:51	 
		 
00:41:28	It's coming.
		그자들이 오고 있어
