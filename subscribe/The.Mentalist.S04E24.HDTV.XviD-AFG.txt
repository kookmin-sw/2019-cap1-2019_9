		레드존의 의도를 알잖아? 
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:05	He asked me
		if I'm ready to quit.
		그만두지 않겠냐던데
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	- How does Jane seem to you?
		- I think he's in trouble.
		- 제인 어때 보여? 
		- 문제가 있는 것 같습니다 
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	You tortured the guy,
		for Christ sakes.
		당신은 그 자를 고문한 거란 말이요
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	I gave an evil psychopath
		justice.
		난 사악한 사이코패스에게 정의를 집행한 겁니다 
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	I'm not gonna apologize.
		사과할 생각은 없어요 
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	You're fired.
		Get outta here right now.
		당신 해고야, 당장 여기서 꺼져 
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Don't do anything rash.
		We can work this out.
		성급한 짓 하지마, 우린 이거 해결할 수 있어 
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	We'll fix it.
		이겨낼 수 있어

00:01:17	Magic, huh?
		마술사?
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	"Magic"?
		마술?
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:21	Tough business.
		그거 힘든 일이던데 
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	Yeah. No, uh, I'm--I'm--
		I'm not a magician, no.
		그래, 음...아니, 전 마술사 아녜요 
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:26	No?
		그래요?
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	No.
		네 
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	You do coin tricks
		and you have the look.
		동전마술도 할 줄 알고 왠지 그런 느낌인데 
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	What is the look?
		무슨 느낌이요? 
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:33	Like you're hiding stuff.
		속에 뭔가 감추고 있는 느낌 
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	I've seen you around,
		근처에서 당신 자주 봤어요 
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	served you drinks
		a couple times.
		당신한테 서빙도 몇번 했는데 
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:39	Yeah, I remember.
		Uh, Lorelei, right?
		기억나네요, 이름이 로렐라이 맞죠? 
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	How you doing?
		I'm--I'm Patrick.
		반갑네요, 전 패트릭이에요 
00:01:44	 
		 
00:01:44	Hey, Patrick.
		So you're not a magician?
		안녕, 패트릭. 그래서 마술사는 아니시다? 
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:47	No. No, I'm a con man.
		I steal from people.
		전 사기꾼이에요. 사람들을 등쳐 돈을 뺏죠 
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:52	Wow.
		와 
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	You just come right out
		and say it--
		인사하자마자 한다는 말이
00:01:56	 
		 
00:01:56	"I steal from people"--
		like, "I sell shoes,"
		꼭 '전 구두를 팔아요' 처럼 '전 사람을 등쳐요'라니
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:00	like it's not a big deal.
		그런 말 굉장히 아무렇지 않게 하네요 
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:01	Well, it's not a big deal.
		아무렇지 않은 일이니까요 
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:02	If you know what you're doing,
		it's very easy.
		자기가 뭘 하는지만 똑똑히 알고 있으면
		어렵지 않아요 
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:04	It's a big deal because
		it's wrong to steal from people.
		아무렇지 않은 일이 아니죠.
		사람을 등치는건 잘못된 일이니까 
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:08	No such thing as wrong.
		잘못된일 아닌일이 세상에 어딨어요 
00:02:11	 
		 
00:02:11	Really? When did that happen?
		정말? 그럼요? 
00:02:13	 
		 
00:02:13	Well,
		there's legal or illegal,
		합법 불법은 있죠 
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	there's, uh...
		또는... 
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:18	happy or sad, rich or poor,
		alive or dead,
		기쁘다 슬프다, 부자다 가난하다, 
		죽었다 살았다는 가능하지만 
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:23	but there's
		no wrong or right.
		세상에 옳고 그른건 없어요 
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:25	Stuff just happens, that's all.
		One damn thing after another.
		그건 그냥 세상이 그럴 뿐인 거예요. 
		운이 나빴다가 좋았다가 하듯이 
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:29	Of course there's wrong
		or right. You know that.
		옳고 그른건 마음에서 알죠 
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:35	I killed a man last year.
		작년에 사람을 죽였어요 
00:02:38	 
		 
00:02:38	Turns out he wasn't a man
		I wanted to kill. Wrong guy.
		내가 죽이려던 남자가 아니라
		엉뚱한 사람으로 밝혀지긴 했지만 
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:41	Anyway...
		어쨌든... 
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:43	now when I recall
		shooting him dead...
		쏘아 죽이던 순간을 떠올리면 
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:47	still feels good.
		아직도 기분이 좋아요 
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:50	It's a happy little memory
		to cherish,
		소중한 기분이 드는 좋은 추억이에요 
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:53	like Christmas.
		마치 크리스마스의 추억처럼 
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:55	Now you're just trying
		to shock me, aren't you?
		지금 날 쇼크주려는 거죠
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	Yes.
		맞아요 
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:00	You seem like a happy soul,
		Lorelei. You happy?
		상당히 즐거운 캐릭터인것 같은데, 
		로렐라이 당신은 행복해요? 
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	Yes. I am.
		그래요 
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	Well, that's nice.
		잘됐네요 
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	What's your secret?
		비결이 뭐죠?
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	Faith.
		믿음
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	Oh, yes.
		그러시구나 
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	Yes, I've heard that.
		그런 분 많더라구요 
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:16	Patrick.
		패트릭
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:19	This is nice.
		이거 잘됐군
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	Been looking for you.
		How you doing? Everything okay?
		계속 찾아다녔어, 어떻게 지냈나?
		일은 잘 되고? 
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:24	Well, how you doing, Oscar?
		오스카 당신이야말로?
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	I'm good.
		How you doing?
		나야 잘 지냈지 
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	Good. This is, um, Lorelei.
		이쪽은 로렐라이
00:03:28	 
		 
00:03:28	Lorelei.
		What are you guys drinking?
		안녕하세요, 지금 마시는게 뭐야? 
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	Uh, same again for my friends
		here. Cognac for me.
		내 친구들한테 같은 걸로 한 잔씩.
		나는 꼬냑으로 줘 
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:36	This is an amazing man
		right here.
		정말 신기한 친구야 
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	Mm.
		 
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	This man can reach
		beyond the veil of death.
		사후세계를 내다볼 줄 알거든 
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	Did you know that?
		들었어?
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	Uh, no. No, we--
		we just met, really.
		실은 방금 만난 사이라서요 
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	You ever lose someone?
		누군가를 잃어본 적 있나?
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	I lost my mother when I was 5.
		난 5살에 어머니를 여의었어 
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	But this man...
		he let me talk to her,
		하지만 이 친구가 어머니와 날 연결시켜줬지 
00:03:55	 
		 
00:03:55	and I truly felt
		her presence.
		그곳에 계신 어머니를 느낄 수 있었어 
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	She said she loves me.
		She's always watching over me.
		날 사랑하신다고, 영원히 지켜보신다고 했어 
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:02	Wow.
		와 
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	Well, it's both
		a gift and a curse.
		축복이자 저주죠 
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	Yeah, well...
		그런데 
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:08	I told my father
		all about you...
		아버지한테 네 얘길 했거든 
00:04:11	 
		 
00:04:11	about, uh, what an awesome
		spiritual experience it was...
		내가 얼마나 놀라운 경험을 했는지 말야 
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:16	Best 10 grand
		I ever spent.
		정말 후회없이 치른 만 달러였단 얘기도 
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	My father--he's a tight bastard.
		He says, "10 grand?!
		그런데 우리 아버지가 좀 노랭이야
		'만달러?' 이러더니 
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	Screw that bitch.
		Go get your money back""
		'그년 입을 찢어버리고 그 돈 찾아와' 하더라고 
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:25	Turns out
		my mother's not dead.
		알고보니 우리 어머니가 안 죽었대 
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	She ran off with
		her aerobics instructor.
		에어로빅 강사랑 눈이 맞아 튀었다는군
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	She lives in San Juan,
		Puerto Rico. Owns a nail salon.
		푸에르토리코의 산 주앙에 살면서
		네일 살롱을 차리고 있대 
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:35	That explains why she was
		so easy to contact, I guess.
		미인이 달라붙는게 이상하더라니
		오늘 일진이 안 좋았네요 
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:41	That's good
		you can smile about this.
		이 상황에서도 웃을 수 있다니 대단해 
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	Here's the thing--
		그게 말이죠 
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:44	I'm gonna be forgiving.
		용서해줄게 
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	Give me my money back,
		and, uh,
		내 돈이나 토해놔 
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	Mervin here is gonna tune you up
		a little, that's all.
		그리고 여기 멀빈이 널 아주 조금
		아주 살짝 손봐줄거야 
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	You, uh...
		you mind if I, um...
		좀 실례 
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	Give me my money back.
		내 돈 토해내라고 
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	Yeah, um, can I--pass a light.
		Um, I don't have it.
		미안하지만 불 좀 
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	I spent it all.
		없어요, 다 썼어요 
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	Okay.
		그래 
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	Well, Mervin's gonna break
		your arms and the legs...
		그럼 멀빈이 네놈 팔다리를 분질러 놀거야 
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	And then when you're walking
		again, you'll owe me 50 grand.
		네가 다시 걸을 수 있게 될 즈음이면
		나한테 5만달러를 빚지게 되겠지 
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:20	I got it, I got it,
		I got it. Go get him.
		내 이럴 줄 알았어, 가서 잡아와! 
00:05:22	 
		 
00:06:25	Break it up, you two!
		거기 떨어져!
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	Hands up!
		고개 들어! 
00:06:31

		Hi.
		안녕하세요 
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	Oh, God.
		What did that?
		오 이런, 어떻게 된거야? 
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:12	Shotgun from about
		6 inches away.
		6인치 거리에서 샷건을 쏜거야 
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	John Doe all the way.
		완전히 신원 불명이지 
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	No wallet, no tattoos,
		no jewelry, no face.
		지갑 없어, 문신도 없어, 
		장신구도 없어, 얼굴도 없어 
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	There's a lot of blood.
		피 좀 봐 
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	He must've been killed
		right here.
		여기서 즉사했을겁니다 
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	Robbery?
		강도일까? 
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	Well, there's
		no foot traffic.
		발자국도 없는데 
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	Nothing but offices around here.
		It's dead at night.
		근처엔 사무실 뿐인데 죽기는 밤에 죽었고 
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	Well, he must've arrived here
		in some kind of vehicle.
		여기까지 실려왔을수도 
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	There's an interstate ramp
		a block away from here.
		주(州)간 고속도로 진입로가 한 블럭 밖에 있어 
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	Our friend could've come
		from Oregon.
		오레곤에서 넘어왔을 수도 있어 
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	Give us 20 minutes with him,
		and you can bag him.
		20분만 살펴보고 줄게 
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	No hurry. Hey.
		천천히 봐도 돼, 근데 
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	Sorry about Jane, by the way.
		That's too bad.
		제인 일은 정말 안됐어 
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	Too bad about what?
		뭐가 안돼? 
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	That he got arrested.
		체포당했다며 
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	I heard it from some guys
		in vice.
		강력반에 지인이 있거든 
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	He got busted for assault,
		fraud, narcotics,
		베가스에서 폭행, 사기, 마약소지죄로 잡혔대 
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	and resisting arrest
		in Vegas.
		체포불응까지 했나봐 
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	That's terrible.
		이런 
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	We should do something.
		우리가 이러고 있으면 안돼요 
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	- Like what?
		- I don't know.
		- 그럼?
		- 저도 모르죠 
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Try and talk to him, I guess,
		see if he needs help.
		대화라도 해보거나, 뭐 필요한 건 없는지
		물어라도 보고 
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	It's been six months
		since he left.
		떠난지 반년이나 됐잖아요 
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	Maybe he's changed.
		- No.
		- 그 사이 마음이 바뀌었을지도 모르고
		- 아니 
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	But--
		하지만 
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	I offered him
		all the help in the world,
		세상에 존재하는 모든 방식으로
		도와준다 해 봤어 
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:06	and he turned me down
		many times.
		하지만 매번 거절했어 
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	He has to want to change.
		지가 변해야 돼 
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	He has to hit bottom
		and know it.

00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	That's recovery 101, right?
		그게 재활치료 첫단계 아니야? 
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	I guess.
		그럴지도 
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	Well, maybe this is bottom.
		지금 친게 바닥일수도 있죠 
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	It's pretty low, boss.
		그것도 꽤 깊은 바닥인데요 반장님
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	When he wants help,
		he'll ask us.
		도움이 필요하거든 지가 먼저 말할거야 
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	He knows where we are.
		우리한테 연락하려면 할수도 있잖아 
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	Hey, Pat. Good seeing ya.
		팻, 만나서 반가웠어 
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	Get our John Doe here
		on ice quick.
		여기 신원미상자는 얼른 얼음 푸대에 넣어라 
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	I think he's gonna be
		around for a while.
		머잖아 가겠다 
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:44	Sign that.
		서명하세요 
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:48	Uh, wh-why am I being released?
		I didn't raise bail.
		제가 왜 풀려난거죠? 보석금도 안 치렀는데 
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	Somebody raised it for you.
		누가 와서 대신 치렀습니다 
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	Who was that?
		누군데요? 
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	I don't have
		that information.
		그 정보는 없습니다 
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	Teresa Lisbon is my guess.
		Huh? Lisbon?
		내 생각엔 테레사 리스본인데.
		리스본 맞죠? 
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	I don't have
		that information.
		그 정보는 없습니다 
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	Okay. You don't have
		that information.
		없으시다, 알겠어요 
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	You can keep that.
		Thank you.
		그건 그냥 여기 둬요 
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:15	Oy.

00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	Bad news--
		our John Doe's prints
		나쁜 소식은 신원미상자의 지문이 
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	didn't get a match,
		so we still have no I.D.
		저희 데이터에 없어서 여전히 신원미상이라는 거 
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	Of course.
		그렇겠지 
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	Good news--
		SAC P.D. caught a homicide
		좋은 소식은 새크라멘토 경찰이 
		어제 살인 혐의로 
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	on Pacoima and Third
		last night.
		파코이마 3번가에서 갱을 잡았어요 
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	Suspect got away,
		but they have an eyewitness,
		용의자는 달아났지만 목격자를 확보했어요 
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	and they recovered
		the murder weapon--
		그리고 총신을 잘라 개조한 
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	a sawed-off shotgun.
		샷건을 현장에서 발견했어요 
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Ejected cartridge was
		the same make as ours,
		카트리지 모델이 저희 사건이랑 동일해요 
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	and Pacoima and Third is
		only ten blocks
		갱단의 활동 범위가 
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:33	from our murder scene.
		저희 사건 현장에서 10블럭 안팎이구요 
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	That's news.
		그건 그냥 소식이지 
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	Good news would be better
		than that.
		좋은 소식까진 아니야 
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	It's a lead.
		그래도 단서잖아요 
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	You're right.
		SAC P.D., you said?
		그래 맞다, 새크라멘토 경찰이라고? 
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	Uh, who's the detective
		on that?
		담당자가 누구야? 
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	Not sure. Somebody on
		Captain Rupert's night shift.
		잘 모르는데 루퍼트 경감 야간조 소속이래요 
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	You're right.
		It's a good lead,
		그래, 좋은 단서다 
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	and I need to get
		out of here.
		나도 여기서 못살겠다, 나가야지 
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Let's go down in person
		and see what they have.
		직접 그쪽 서에 들러서 눈으로 봐야겠어 
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:54	 
		 
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:03	Uh...

00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	Surprise.
		짜잔 
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	Yeah.
		 
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	Lorrie, right?
		이름이 로리? 
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	Lorelei.
		로렐라이 
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	Sorry. This was a mistake.
		올때가 아닌걸 모르고 실수했네요 
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	No, no, no, no, no.
		Lorelei.
		아니에요, 그렇지 않아요 로렐라이 
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	I'm very happy to see you.
		이렇게 와줘서 기뻐요 
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	Just, uh, been
		a little slow today.
		늦잠을 좀 잔 것 뿐이에요 
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:27	It's--it's been
		a rough week.
		좀 힘든 한 주였거든요 
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	Yeah, I can imagine.
		그래 보이네요 
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	I brought you
		some chicken soup.
		닭고기 수프를 좀 가져왔는데 
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	For me?
		날 위해? 
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	Yeah.
		네 
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	Come in.
		들어와요 
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:42	Excuse the mess.
		정리가 안돼 미안합니다 
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:46	How did you know
		my address?
		내가 사는 데는 어떻게 알았어요? 
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	The bail bondsman gave it
		to me.
		보석보증인이 가르쳐줬어요 
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:51	How did you know
		who the bail bondsman was?
		보석보증인은 어쩌다 만났죠? 
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Oh.
		 
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	What are you, Columbo here
		with the third degree?
		당신 뭐예요, 삼류 콜롬보 형사? 
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	I'm sorry.
		Just a little curious.
		미안해요, 그냥 궁금해서 그랬어요 
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:01	I knew who he was
		because I was the one
		내가 당신 보석금을 치렀으니까 
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	that put up the money
		for your bail.
		그때 만났죠 
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	That's a lot of money.
		돈이 꽤 컸을텐데 
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	I'll--I'll pay you back
		as soon as I can.
		내가 최대한 빠른 시일내 갚도록 할게요 
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	Figured you were good
		for it.
		형편 보니 잘도 그러겠네요 
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	Why'd you do that for me?
		왜 그랬어요? 
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:18	You seemed like a good man
		who lost his way.
		길을 잘못 들었다 뿐이지
		당신은 좋은 사람 같거든요 
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	I could help, so I did...
		마침 도와줄 수 있었다, 그래서 도와줬다 
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:24	and at this point,
		그러니까 지금은 
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	a straight up "thank you"
		would be okay.
		솔직한 얼굴로 '고마워요'라고
		말하면 돼요 
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:29	Thank you.
		고마워요 
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:32	There's, uh, a lot
		of good men out there...
		좋은 사람이라면 널린게 좋은 사람인데 
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:36	who have lost their way.
		길 잘못 든 사람도 천지고 
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:39	Wow. You're gonna make me
		say it out loud?
		굳이 내가 이 말 큰소리로 하는 걸
		봐야겠어요? 
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:42	I felt like we got along
		pretty good.
		우리가 꽤 잘 어울릴것 같았어요 
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	I felt like there was
		some kind of...
		우리 사이에 뭔가 기묘한 끈이 있다 
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	weird connection there
		between us.
		그런 생각이 들었어요 
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	I trusted my feelings.
		난 내 느낌을 믿어요 
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:56	Damn it. Was I wrong?
		아니면 잘못 짚었나?
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	No.
		아뇨 
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	You weren't wrong.

00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	Okay then.
		좋아요 그럼 
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	I have to warn you,
		Lorelei, um,
		미리 경고는 하겠어요 
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	I'm not the great catch
		you might think I am from...
		첫인상하곤 달리 
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	first impressions.
		당신이 봉잡은게 아닐지도 몰라요 
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:18	That's okay. Neither am I.
		괜찮아요, 나도 아니니깐 
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:25	Bean, tell these people
		what you saw.
		빈, 이분들한테 본대로 말해요 
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	I'm collecting cans on Third,
		3번가에서 캔을 줍고 있었어 
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	right next to the park
		where they sell their drugs.
		갱단이 약을 파는 공원 바로 옆이지 
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	There's a gunshot. Boom!
		총소리가 빵! 하고 들렸어 
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	Then a tall, young,
		Latin gentleman
		키가 큰 라틴계 젊은이가 
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	come running out of the park
		holding a sawed-off shotgun.
		짧은 샷건을 든채 공원에서 뛰쳐나왔어 
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	He trips and falls over.
		발이 꼬이더니 넘어졌지 
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	Drops the gun.
		Then he gets up and runs away,
		총을 떨어뜨렸지만 일어나 그냥 달아났어 
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	leaves the gun,
		and that's what I saw.
		그게 내가 본 다야 
00:13:48

		young, Latin gentleman--
		키가 큰 라틴 젊은이 말예요

		at him?
		얼굴을 제대로 봤나요? 
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	Come right by me.
		바로 내 옆을 지나쳤어 
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	Got a scar on his face
		right here,
		얼굴 바로 여기 상처가 있고 
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	little chin beard...
		Mm-hmm.
		수염이 조금 있고 
00:13:57

		like a pirate,
		해적처럼 커다란 금귀고리를 달고 
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	- black T-shirt, jeans...
		- White shoes.
		검은 티에 청바지, 하얀 운동화를 신었어 
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Anything on the T-shirt?
		Logo? Numbers?
		티셔츠에 로고나 번호 같은건 없었나요?
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	Don't think so.
		글쎄 
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	Thanks, Bean.
		고마워요 빈

00:16:41	Yeah, I think I was tired.
		피곤했나봐요 
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	I gotta go to work.
		I made some eggs.
		이제 일 나가야 해요. 달걀 좀 부쳐놨어요 
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	How did you know
		I love eggs?
		내가 달걀 좋아하는지 어떻게 알고? 
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:56	This is delicious.
		Thank you.
		맛있었어요, 고마워요 
00:16:58	 
		 
00:17:00	We had fun, huh?
		즐거웠죠? 
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Yeah.
		그럼요 
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:05	Perhaps we can see
		each other again.
		나중에 또 만나면 좋겠네요 
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	That's not up to me.
		나한테 달린게 아니죠 
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	Oh, you have no say in it?
		완곡한 거절이네요? 
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	None at all.
		전혀요 
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	It's very restful.
		있는대로 얘기하는 거예요 
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	I don't follow you.
		안 쫓아다닐게요 
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	I do what Red John
		tells me to do.
		난 레드존이 시킨대로 했을 뿐이에요 
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:23	What?
		네? 
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:26	Your freedom,
		our night together--
		당신 보석, 우리 어젯밤 관계 
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:28	that was a gift from him.
		모두 그분의 선물이에요 
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:33	You can hurt me,
		if you'd like.
		원한다면 날 해쳐도 좋아요 
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:37	No, I don't want
		to hurt you.
		당신을 해칠 생각 없어요 
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	I've given up.
		He knows that.
		난 다 포기했어요, 그 자도 알텐데 
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	What does he want from me?
		나한테서 원하는게 뭡니까? 
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	He doesn't want anything
		from you.
		아무것도 
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	After all these years,
		he's come to see you
		그 몇년간 줄곧 그분은 
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	as an old comrade
		rather than an enemy.
		당신에게 적으로서가 아닌
		동지로 다가가고 싶어했어요 
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	He hopes you'll come to feel
		the same way.
		당신과 느낌을 공유하길 바랐어요 
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	A comrade.
		동지라 
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Patrick...
		패트릭 
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	look at yourself.
		지금 당신을 봐요 
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	You need a new life.
		당신은 새 인생이 필요해요 
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	He can give that to you.
		그분이 베풀어 주실 거예요 
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	You have to leave.
		떠나요 
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	He's offering the hand
		of friendship.
		그분은 우정의 손길을 내밀고 계세요 
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	If you refuse him,
		he'll be upset.
		거절한다면 화를 내실 거예요 
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	Anyone would be.
		누구라도 그렇듯
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	Get out.
		나가요 
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:24	You know where to find me.
		날 어디서 찾으면 되는지 알죠 
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:51	Hey, Grace, you seen Lisbon?
		그레이스, 반장님 봤어? 
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	She had to take
		some personal time.
		잠시 사무실 비우신대
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	- Where'd she go?
		- Didn't say.
		- 어디 가셨는데? 
		- 말씀 없으셨어요 
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	We have a lead.
		단서가 있어 
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	I just got this
		from the gang unit.
		갱전담반에서 자료가 왔어 
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	Kevin Cintron,
		A.K.A. Purple,
		케빈 싱트론, 속칭 '퍼플'
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	affiliated with
		the Grape Street Lobos.
		Grape Street Lobos 소속이고 
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	Matches the witness description
		exactly.
		목격자 증언과 인상착의가 일치해 
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	Did you show the witness
		the photo?
		목격자에게 사진은 보여줬어? 
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	I do that, and we have to go
		through SAC P.D. homicide,
		그랬고, 새크라멘토 강력반이랑
		함께 진행해야 하게 됐는데 
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	and they'll want to take
		the bust, and we need the bust.
		거기도 건수를 올리고 싶어하고
		저희도 건수가 필요하죠 
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	Must be a thousand bad guys
		금귀고리에 수염 달고 얼굴에 
		상처 있는 녀석들은 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	with gold earrings, beards,
		and scars.
		길거리에 수천은 돼 
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	I got an address
		from his P.O.
		가석방 관리인한테서 주소를 받았어 
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	Well, after killing
		two people,
		두사람이나 죽여놓고 
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	that's probably not
		where he's at.
		거기 얌전히 있을것 같진 않은데 
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	It's a good place to start,
		though, and I'm going.
		거기서부터 시작하면 되죠, 
		아무튼 난 가볼거예요 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	You want me to get you
		some doughnuts while I'm out?
		돌아올때 도넛이라도 사다줘요? 
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:20:02	This is God.
		내가 바로 주님이니라 
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	What is it now?
		고하라!
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	You scared the life out
		of me.
		심장 떨어지는 줄 알았네 
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	I crawled all
		the way on my hands and knees
		저 문에서부터 네발로 기어왔다 
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	from that door,
		but it was worth it.
		완전 효과 짱이네 
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐해? 
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	It's good to see you.
		How have you been?
		이렇게 보니까 좋다, 어떻게 지냈어? 
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	Worried sick is how I've been,
		사람을 염려하다 반 죽게 만들어놓고 
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	and then you pop in here
		like some sort of a lunatic,
		여기서 미친놈처럼 나타나서 
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	playing games,
		asking me how I've been.
		다 속임수였다고 하고 나더러
		어떻게 지냈냐고 묻고 
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	- Just...
		- Shame on you.
		- 그러니까...
		- 창피한 줄을 알아 
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	stay calm, okay?
		진정하고, 응? 
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	It's important that
		no one sees us together.
		우리 둘이 만나는걸 아무도 
		모르게 해야 해 
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:30	Why not?
		왜? 
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:33	I'm faking my breakdown.
		가짜로 폐인 행세를 하고 있어 
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	It's a ruse to trap
		Red John.
		레드존을 위한 함정을 파려고 
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	You son of a bitch.
		이런 개새끼 
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	You son of a bitch.
		넌 개잡종 새끼야 
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	Okay, we are in a church.
		교회에서 말 좀 가려써라 
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	Uh, wait, so how does
		faking a breakdown--
		정말 네가 폐인인 '척'만 한 거라면
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	if that's what you're
		 really doing,
		내 눈엔 네 꼬라지가 정말 폐인 같긴 하지만 
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	because it looks
		pretty real to me,
		네가 절망한 척을 하는게 
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	how does that trap
		Red John?
		어떻게 레드존을 위한 함정이 
		된다는 거야? 
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	What does Red John want
		from me?
		레드존이 나한테 원하는게 뭘까? 
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	What did he send
		that little girl to ask me?
		여자아이편에 보낸 메시지가 뭐였지? 
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	Do you give up?
		포기할 것인가? 
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	Exactly, and I do give up.
		그래, 그래서 난 포기했어 
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	I quit.
		I burn the Red John files.
		다 접었고, 레드존 파일도 불태웠어 
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	I freak out at the boss.
		I admit defeat,
		상사를 질겁하게 했고 
		패배를 선언했어 
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:04	and I sink
		into a terrible depression.
		그리고 끔찍한 절망속에 빠져들었지 
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	Brilliant. You did
		that part great. Now what?
		잘했어, 그 점은 아주 완벽하게 해줬지.
		그 다음은? 
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	And why doesn't he just
		kill me?
		그럼 왜 와서 날 죽이지 않는거야? 
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:13	Because it's too easy.
		He wants to turn me.
		그건 너무 쉽기 때문이야.
		그는 날 바꾸고 싶어해 
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:15	He wants to make me
		his disciple.
		그의 제자로 들이고 싶어하는거야 
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	So I admit defeat,
		and then he reaches out
		그래서 내가 패배를 선언하길 기다려 
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	to start a conversation.
		슬그머니 다가와 말을 건네는 거야 
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	Well,
		that's all supposition.
		그건 다 네 추정이야 
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	- He's not gonna--
		- He already has reached out.
		- 레드존은 결코... 
		- 이미 내게 접근했어 
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	He sent me a message.
		내게 메시지를 전했어 
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	I need to start a new life,
		and he can help me.
		내가 새 삶을 시작해야 한다며,
		나를 도울 수 있대 
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	Help you?
		He wants to help you?
		도와줘? 널 도와주고 싶어한다고? 
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	- Yeah.
		- What are you gonna do?
		- 그래 
		- 넌 어떡할거야? 
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	Well, I'm gonna take him up
		on the offer.
		제안을 받아들일거야 
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	I'm in a lot
		of real trouble.
		아닌게 아니라 내가 요새 좀 큰일이거든
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	I do need a new life.
		난 새로운 삶이 필요해 
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:48	Yes, you do.
		그건 그래 
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	That's what makes
		the gag work.
		웃기는 얘기지 
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:52	Then what?
		그래서? 
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	Well, I don't know.
		I let him lead.
		나도 몰라, 하자는대로 해볼거야 
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:55	That's the beauty of it.
		그게 요지야 
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	He thinks I'm the fish
		and he's the fisherman.
		나는 고기, 자신은 어부라고 생각하겠지 
00:21:59	 
		 
00:21:59	Unless he sees the truth.
		진실을 알아채기 전까지는 
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	I am giving him
		his heart's desire.
		난 놈이 갈망하는 걸 줄거야 
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	He will see
		what he wants to see.
		보고 싶어하는 걸 보여줄거야 
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	Or not.
		보고 싶었던게 아닐수도 있지 
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	Fooled you. I can fool him.
		넌 속았잖아, 놈도 속일 수 있어 
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	Yeah, you fooled me
		all right. Well done.
		날 감쪽같이 속이긴 했지, 참 잘했다 
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	Yeah. Well...
		그래, 그건.... 
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	I'm sorry.
		내가 미안해 
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:19	I tried calling.
		전화했어 
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:20	I tried calling you
		hundreds of times,
		수백번도 넘게 전화했어 
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:23	begging you to talk to me,
		begging you to get help.
		나랑 제발 얘기 좀 하자고,
		도와주겠다고 빌다시피 했어 
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	Not a reply.
		Not a word. Not a text.
		한번도, 한마디도 대꾸하지 않았지.
		문자 한번도 없었어 
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	Sorry.
		미안해 
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	You know what?
		그거 알아? 
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	I have not been sleeping.
		I've been--
		그동안 잠도 잘 못 잤어, 그동안... 
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	forget it. Never mind.
		Y-you know, you're a jerk.
		너 같은 병신한테 얘기해서 뭐하냐, 잊어버려.
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:44	And your plan? It's stupid.
		It's not even a plan.
		그리고 너 계획? 완전 멍청해.
		그건 계획도 아니야 
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:50	But you will help me?
		하지만 도와줄거지? 
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	What am I supposed to say, no?
		God, you're despicable.
		그럼 내가 뭐라고 해, 싫어?
		넌 진짜 비열하고 못된 놈이야 
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:58	Take this. It's clean.
		이거 받아, 추적으로부터 안전해 
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:00	I'll call you on it
		when the time comes.
		때가 되면 이걸로 전화할게 
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	In the meantime,
		do not contact me.
		그때까지는 내게 연락하지 마 
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	Do not let anyone
		from CBI contact me,
		CBI의 아무도 연락하지 못하게 해 
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	and don't tell anyone
		the truth.
		그리고 이 사실을 아무에게도 말하지 마 
00:23:09	 
		 
00:23:09	Not a soul.
		단 한 사람에게도 
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:11	I cannot believe
		정말 난 믿을 수가 없다 
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	you didn't tell me
		you were doing this,
		이런 일을 꾸미면서 일언반구도 없고 
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	that you couldn't trust me
		with a secret like that.
		나를 못 믿어 혼자 끙끙거려? 
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	We're supposed to be
		partners.
		우린 파트너야 
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	God knows,
		I am happy you're back.
		네가 무사히 돌아와 기쁘긴 해 
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	It is a huge relief,
		정말 마음이 놓여 
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	but what you did,
		frankly, was a betrayal.
		하지만 네가 저지른건, 배신이야 
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:26	God, I hate you, Jane.
		니가 정말 밉다, 제인 
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	I hate you!
		미워 죽겠다고! 
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:36	We have your prints
		on the shotgun, Kevin.
		케빈, 샷건에서 당신 지문이 나왔습니다 
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	We have an eyewitness
		who saw you
		당신이 윌리스를 쏘는 걸
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:39	shoot Dashawn Willits
		with that shotgun.
		목격한 사람도 있습니다 
00:23:42	 
		 
00:23:42	I'm showing them the gun
		because I'm trying
		총을 팔려고 
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	to sell it to 'em.
		보여주고 있었을 뿐이오 
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	Fool tried to take the gun
		from me.
		바보가 총을 뺏으려 들었지 
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:46	I had no other choice.
		내겐 다른 선택지가 없었어 
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	But the first shooting,
		though,
		하지만 첫번째 총격 말요 
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	the white John Doe
		on Lincoln Avenue,
		링컨 애비뉴의 백인 남자 
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:49	did that guy try to steal
		your gun, too?
		그 자도 당신 총을 뺏으려다
		그렇게 된 겁니까? 
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	I didn't touch that man,
		all right? He killed himself.
		난 그자 솜털 하나 건들지 않았어,
		그 잔 자살한거야 
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:55	I swear to God.
		Me and my boy Manfredo,
		신에게 맹세컨대 나랑 똘마니 만프레도는 
00:23:58	 
		 
00:23:58	we cruisin' down
		the alleyway.
		골목길을 쭉 훑어보고만 있었어 
00:23:59	 
		 
00:23:59	We lookin' for open windows,
		to be honest with you,
		솔직히 말해 빈집털이를 물색하고 있었지 
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:01	see this guy sittin' up
		against the wall,
		남자가 벽에 기대어 앉아 있었어 
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	got a bicycle next to him
		and a sawed-off shotgun.
		옆에 자전거가 세워져 있고
		샷건을 가지고 있었지 
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:07	Just as we start
		to get close...
		우리가 가까이 가려 하는데 
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:09	Damn if he don't blow off
		his head.
		지 머릴 쐈으니 망정이지 
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	Hara-kiri.
		No messing around.
		깨끗하게 혼자 죽었어 
00:24:13	 
		 
00:24:13	How do we know
		you're telling the truth?
		당신 말을 어떻게 믿습니까? 
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	You don't.
		You just know what is.
		못 믿겠지 
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:17	Come on, man,
		you guys ask Manfredo,
		이봐, 만프레도를 불러 물어봐 
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	he gonna tell you
		the same thing.
		나랑 정확히 같은 얘길 할거야 
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:23	Yeah.
		Man just shot himself.
		놈이 스스로 쐈다니까 
00:24:25	 
		 
00:24:25	Boom! Freaked me out.
		빵! 놀라 자지러질 뻔 했어 
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:28	I wanted the gun,
		but Kevin took it.
		내가 총을 갖고 싶었지만
		케빈이 가졌어요 
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	I got the bike.
		Sweet fixie.
		난 자전거를 가졌죠, 
		꽤 괜찮은 고정식 자전거였어요 
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	Where's the bike, Manfredo?
		자전거는 어딨습니까?
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	Got stolen.
		도둑 맞았어요 
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:36	I know. Ironic, right?
		나도 알아요, 아이러니하죠? 
00:24:38	 
		 
00:24:38	Did you take anything else
		from him?
		다른 가져간 건 없습니까? 
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	 We looked. 
		 He had nothing on him. 
		 뒤져봤지만 가진게 없었어요 
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	I think he's telling
		the truth.
		거짓말같지 않아 
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	Cintron admitted
		to the second killing,
		싱트론은 두번째 살인에 대해선 시인했어 
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	no problem.
		그건 문제가 안돼
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:48	Why would he lie about
		this one?
		그럼 이건 뭣하러 부인하겠어?
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	Looks like we'll never know
		who he was. Poor soul.
		그 남자 정체는 영원히 오리무중이겠어요,
		가엾게도 
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	Mm.
		 
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:53	Lisbon, a word?
		리스본, 얘기 좀 할까? 
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:54	Yeah.
		네 
00:24:56	 
		 
00:24:56	Uh, is that the John Doe case
		you're working on?
		그 신원미상 사건인가? 
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	Yes, sir. It looks to be
		a suicide.
		자살한 것으로 보입니다 
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	Oh, good. Excellent.
		Get that off the books, eh?
		그거 잘됐군, 그럼 수사도 여기서 끝이군 그래? 
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	Um...
		 
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	I wanted to talk
		to you about Jane.
		제인에 관해 얘기하고 싶네 
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	It's been six months
		since he's gone.
		떠난지 반년이 됐어 
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	I think it's time
		for a little outreach.
		조금 도와줄 때가 아닌가 싶어 
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	Mm?
		Well, it's the humane thing to do.
		인도주의적으로 그 정돈 해야지 
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	He was a big part
		of the CBI family, after all.
		어쨌든 넓은 의미에서 CBI 가족이 아닌가 
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	I suppose, but I--
		그냥 제 생각엔 
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	I just--I-I just want
		to give him a call, see if,
		전화라도 해서 
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	you know, I can't
		persuade him into rehab
		재활원이나 정신과 치료를 
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	or a psychiatry program
		or some such.
		받아보라고 설득하긴 어렵겠지만 
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	You know, it could make
		a big difference
		그래도 재판 과정에서 
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	in his sentencing.
		그게 큰 도움이 될거야 
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:23	He could get
		community service.
		봉사활동 선에서 그칠 수도 있고 
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:25	He could come back
		and work for us eventually.
		어떻게 어떻게 우리랑 다시 같이
		일할수도 있지 
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	God knows, we need him,
		closure rates being
		누가 알겠나, 우린 제인이 필요해 
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	what they are right now--
		low.
		지금 우리 기소 성공률이 굉장히 낮아
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	Yes, sir, and we will do
		our best to fix that,
		그 점은 제가 최선을 다해 시정하겠습니다 
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	but I don't think
		we can help Jane.
		하지만 우리가 제인을 도울 수는 
		없을 것 같습니다 
00:25:37	 
		 
00:25:37	Besides, y--
		he's made his bed.
		게다가, 본인이 자초한 일입니다 
00:25:40	 
		 
00:25:40	I don't think I could work
		with him again.
		돌아와도 같이 일은 못할 것 같습니다 
00:25:42	 
		 
00:25:42	I need someone
		I can rely on.
		저는 신뢰할 수 있는 사람과
		일하고 싶습니다 
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:45	I'm surprised.
		이거 의외군 
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	I thought you would want
		to help him.
		자넨 제인을 돕고 싶어할 줄 알았어 
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	Well, I do.
		그렇습니다...만
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	It's not how it looks.
		나름대로 돕는 겁니다 
00:25:52	 
		 
00:25:52	I just have a feeling
		Jane's better off
		지금 당장은 제인이 혼자 있는게 
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:55	left alone right now.
		본인을 위해 더 좋을거라 생각합니다 
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	Okay.
		It was just a thought.
		알겠네, 나도 그냥 해본 말이야 
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:01	Mm.
		 
00:26:04	 
		 
00:26:06	I've been, um,
		I've been thinking about
		당신 친구가 한 말에 대해 
00:26:08	 
		 
00:26:08	what you said
		about your friend.
		생각을 좀 해 봤는데 
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	Yes.
		그래요 
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	You said that he could
		help me start a new life.
		새 인생을 시작하게 도와줄 수 있다고 
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:15	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:26:17	 
		 
00:26:19	What does that mean
		exactly?
		정확히 그게 무슨 뜻입니까? 
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	A new identity. Money.
		새로운 신분, 돈 
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	A place to live.
		A job, if you want one.
		살 집, 원한다면 직장도 
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:27	And I-I do what
		in exchange?
		나는 대신 뭘 내놔야 합니까? 
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	Accept his friendship.
		우정을 받아들여요 
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:32	It's that easy?
		그게 답니까? 
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	Sure.
		물론 
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	Uh, he'll want to speak
		to you first,
		당신이 일정 수준에 이르렀다 판단되면 
00:26:38	 
		 
00:26:38	make sure you're on the level,
		if that's all right.
		그분이 먼저 말을 거실 거예요 
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	Yeah.
		아 
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	And you'll need
		to bring him a gift
		그리고 그분을 존중한다는 표시로 
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	to show your respect
		for him.
		선물을 준비해야 해요 
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	What kind of gift?
		어떤 선물 말이죠? 
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:50	Well, Teresa Lisbon's dead body
		would be the perfect thing.
		테레사 리스본의 시체라면
		완벽하겠군요 
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:59	That's absurd.
		그건 좀 
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:08	What did you tell me?
		나한테 뭐랬죠? 
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	There is no right or wrong.
		세상에 옳고 그른건 없다 
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:13	There's just stuff
		that happens.
		그저 세상이 되어지는 방식이다 
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	No, no. There--there--
		there has to be something else.
		그게 전부라곤 할 수 없죠 
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:20	I can't think of anything else
		that would please him.
		다른 걸로는 그 분을 기쁘게 
		해 드리지 못할 것 같은데요 
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:23	I can't do that.
		그럴 수는 없습니다 
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	I understand
		you're not there yet,
		아직 당신이 거기까지 닿기엔
		모자라다는 건 알아요 
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	but look at it
		from his point of view.
		하지만 그분의 시각에서 보세요 
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:34	How else will he know
		you've truly had
		당신 마음이 정말 변했다는 걸 
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	a change of heart?
		다른 뭘로 증명할 수 있을까요? 
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:46	 
		 
00:27:47	Jane.
		제인
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	Not now.
		지금은 바빠요 
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	Uh, I'm glad to see that...
		다시 봐서 반갑다고... 
00:27:54	 
		 
00:28:04	Jane.
		제인씨 
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:08	Jane.
		제인씨 
00:28:10	 
		 
00:28:10	Well, it's good to see you all.
		모두 여기 있네 
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:14	How are you?
		어떻게들 지냈어? 
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	Uh, we're good.
		How are you?
		괜찮았습니다, 당신은요?
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:18	Never better. Never better.
		이보다 더 좋을 수 없지, 더 좋을 수 없어 
00:28:21	 
		 
00:28:21	Jane?
		제인? 
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	There you are.
		거기 있었구나 
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:35	Good luck, Teresa.
		행운을 빌어, 테레사 
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:41	Love you.
		사랑한다 
00:28:43	 
		 
00:28:43	 
		 
00:29:09	What happened?
		무슨 일이야? 
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:16	Patrick Jane.
		패트릭 제인 그 자가 
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:18	He took Lisbon.
		반장님을 데려갔습니다 
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:20	Is he--ohh.
		 Ohh.
		그건, 오 이런 하느님 얼굴이... 
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:26	Wh-who--
		who is th--who is that?
		누구...이 사람은 누군가? 
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	It's Rigsby.
		릭스비
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:32	It's Wayne Rigsby.
		웨인 릭스비입니다 
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:37	Ohh.
		 
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:40	Turn it up.
		소리 좀 키워주세요 
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:44	 ...in a macabre twist, 
		 after killing Agent Rigsby, 
		 섬뜩한 광기에 차 
		 한 아이의 아버지인 34세 
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	 34-year-old father 
		 of a baby boy, 
		 웨인 릭스비 요원을 죽인 
		 용의자 패트릭 제인은 
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	 the suspect, Patrick Jane, 
		 took Agent Teresa Lisbon, 
		 탈출시 테레사 리스본 요원을 납치했으며 
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:53	 presumed dead, 
		 away with him when he escaped. 
		 당시 요원은 이미 죽었던 것으로 추정됩니다 
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	Authorities will not speculate
		 어째서 용의자가 시신을 필요로 했는지 
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:58	 as to why he wants 
		 her dead body. 
		 관계 기관은 답변하지 못하고 있습니다 
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:06	Ohh. I'm hungry. I'm going
		to the store for nachos.
		배고파요, 나가서 나초라도 사올까봐 
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	You guys want anything?
		They got pizza, hot dogs.
		필요한거 있어요? 그 가게에서
		피자랑 핫도그도 파는데 
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	I'm good.
		난 괜찮아 
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	Me, too. Uh, Rigsby--
		나도. 아 릭스비... 
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	Yeah, I know, I know.
		Don't call Sarah. I know.
		알아요, 사라한테는 전화하지 마라 
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	It's killing me, though.
		She must be freaking out.
		미치고 팔짝 뛰겠지만요.
		사라는 지금 제정신이 아닐 거예요 
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	Well, look
		at the bright side.
		긍정적인 면을 봐 
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:22	Think of how happy
		she's gonna be
		네가 살아서 돌아왔을때 
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	when you come back to life.
		사라가 얼마나 기뻐할까 그런거 
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	Huh.
		 
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:32	So where'd you find
		this place?
		이런덴 언제 찾아놨어? 
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	The owner owes me poker money
		he'll never pay back.
		포커하다 딴 돈 대신 받았지 
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	Oh.
		 
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	So that thing you said
		before you shot me--
		너 날 쏘기 전에 뭔가 말했잖아 
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	uh, what did you mean?
		무슨 뜻이었어? 
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:49	What did I say?
		내가 뭐랬더라? 
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	I was kinda hyped up.
		당시 너무 흥분해서 기억이 안나 
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	Oh, boy. Me, too.
		오, 이런 나도야 
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	I thought at any moment
		we were gonna get found out.
		그때 누가 문이라도 열고 들어올까봐
		얼마나 경황이 없던지 
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	Mm.
		 
00:30:58	 
		 
00:30:59	It's her.
		로렐라이다 
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:02	Hello?
		여보세요? 
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	Spoke to my friend.
		He wants to meet with you.
		만나고 싶대요 
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	2369 Foxglove Parkway,
		southwest Las Vegas.
		라스베가스 남서쪽의 2369 폭스글로브 주차장
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:12	Go there at 3:00 today
		and wait for instructions.
		오늘 세시까지 나와서 지시를 기다려요
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	2369 Foxglove Parkway
		at 3:00.
		세시에 2369 폭스글로브 주차장
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	Don't forget the gift.
		선물 잊지 말아요 
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	I have it right here.
		여기 같이 있어요 
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	Don't bring the whole thing.
		Just the head.
		전부 가져올 필요는 없어요, 머리만 가져와요 
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:28	Okay.
		알겠어요 
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:33	So you want the good news
		or the bad news first?
		좋은 소식이랑 나쁜 소식이 있는데
		어떤 것부터 들을래? 
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	You lost two fine agents.
		I'm sorry.
		두 훌륭한 요원을 잃으셨군요 
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Thank you.
		말씀 감사합니다 
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	I knew Jane was wrong
		somehow,
		제인이 뭔가 이상했다고는 생각했지만 
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	but I certainly never
		expected this.
		이런 식으로 나타날줄은 몰랐어요 
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:44	Well, nobody did.
		누군들 알았겠습니까 
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	We received no evaluation that
		indicated danger of this sort.
		이런 종류의 위험은 전혀
		대비하지 못했습니다 
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	CBI is in no way liable.
		CBI는 더 이상 믿을 수가 없어요 
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	Hmm.
		 
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	Well, the question remains,
		why did Jane do this?
		아직 의문점이 있습니다,
		제인이 왜 그랬을까요? 
00:31:57	 
		 
00:31:57	Orders from Red John?
		레드존으로부터의 지시일까요? 
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	If so, why now? Why Lisbon?
		그렇다면 왜 지금이며 왜 리스본이었을까요? 
00:32:03	 
		 
00:32:03	I was talking with Lisbon.
		리스본 요원과 얘기를 했는데 
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	I suggested we reach out
		to try and help Jane
		처지가 딱하니 먼저 연락해 제인을 돕자고 하자 
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	because he was in trouble,
		and she said "no" very firmly.
		굉장히 단호하게 싫다고 했습니다 
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	She said,
		"it's not how it looks."
		나름대로 돕고 있다고 했죠 
00:32:12	 
		 
00:32:12	Meaning what?
		그게 무슨 뜻이죠? 
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	I don't know.
		I don't know what to think.
		모르겠습니다, 생각 자체가 안돼요 
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	Pretty much
		the whole neighborhood is
		인근의 모든 주택이 
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:19	in foreclosure.
		압류 주택이네요 
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	There's hardly anyone there.
		It's like a ghost town.
		아무도 없겠어요, 유령마을 같아요 
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	Smart move by Red John.
		영리한 위치 선정이군
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:24	Tough to set up any kind
		of surveillance in advance.
		미리 감시 장비를 설치하긴 어렵겠어 
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:27	Any movement's gonna be
		conspicuous.
		어떻게 움직여도 눈에 띌거야 
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:28	He must be suspicious.
		레드존이 의심하고 있다는 뜻이에요 
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	No, he's just cautious.
		그냥 조심하는거야 
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	And he's hooked. He believes.
		나한테 걸려들었어 날 믿고 있어 
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	How can you be sure?
		어떻게 아세요? 
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	Because he wants to believe.
		믿고 싶어하니까 
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:40	We're doing this thing,
		so let's just do it.
		기왕 하는거 제대로 하자 
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	Is everybody clear on the plan?
		We're gonna move soon.
		계획은 다 숙지했지? 곧 움직일거야 
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:44	Yeah.
		네 
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	Hey, you guys, listen,
		I want to apologize
		여러분, 
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	for deceiving you...
		여러분을 속인거 사과하고 싶어
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	Whatever.
		그러세요 
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:52	And thank you
		for helping me now.
		그리고 지금 날 도와줘서 고마워 
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	We're helping the boss.
		반장님을 돕는 겁니다 
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	Yeah. She's helping you.
		We're helping her.
		반장님이 제인씨를 돕는거고
		저흰 반장님을 돕는거죠 
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	Guys, cut him some slack.
		좀 봐 줘라 
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	Oh. Yay, team.
		언제나 멋진 팀이야 
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:15	A 12. Rigsby, W.
		A12, 웨인 릭스비
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:26	No face.
		얼굴이 훼손됐네요 
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:27	Right.
		네 
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	Could be anybody.
		실은 누구라도 될 수 있군요 
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:30	Well, it says "Rigsby" here.
		No mistake.
		하지만 명찰이 제대로 붙었으니
		착오는 없을 겁니다 
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:36	Do you have a tape measure?
		신장 좀 재어볼까요?
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:38	Sure.
		물론이죠 
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:41	Bill, I need you to find out
		A.S.A.P.
		빌, 지금 당장 킴벌 조와 그레이스 반펠트의 
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	where Kimball Cho
		and Grace Van Pelt are located.
		위치를 파악해 보고해요 
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:48	Yeah, right now.
		Hold on one second.
		네, 지금 당장. 잠깐만요 
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:50	Put that at the top
		of his head.
		머리 쪽에 붙들고 계세요 
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:56	5'11".
		5피트 11
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:58	This isn't Wayne Rigsby.
		웨인 릭스비가 아니야 
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	Yeah. Find out where they are.
		네, 지금 그 둘이 어딨는지 찾아내세요 
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:04	Thanks. And, Bill?
		고마워요. 그리고 빌? 
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:05	I want arrest warrants prepped
		for every single member
		리스본 팀의 전원에게 
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	of that CBI team,
		dead or alive.
		수배령을 내리세요 
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:33	 
		 
00:34:45	Mm.
		 
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	The game begins.
		게임 시작이군 
00:34:50	 
		 
00:35:01	Hey, Lisbon.
		야아, 리스본 
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	Must have been a while since
		you rode on the handlebars
		남자 자전거 핸들에 올라타 
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	of a man's bike.
		달려보긴 참 오랫만이겠어 
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	Ha ha.
		 하.하. 
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:07	It's kind of romantic.
		로맨틱하잖아 
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	Wind in your hair.
		바람결에 머리칼을 날리며 
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	You're a sick man.
		너 진짜 짜증나
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:14	5-0-5-9.
		5-0-5-9.
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:18	5-0-6-5. 5-0-6-5...
		5-0-6-5. 5-0-6-5...
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:23	Uh, there is no 5-0-7-1.
		5071번지는 없는데 
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:30	There's nothing.
		It's just desert.
		아무것도 없어, 그냥 공터야 
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	There's no one here.
		아무도 없어 
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:36	Hang on.
		잠깐 
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:40	Long black limousine.
		검은색 리무진이 온다 
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	We're moving in. We'll be
		on the scene in three minutes.
		우리 움직일게, 3분내로 도착할거야 
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	Stay healthy till then.
		그때까지 몸 성히 있어 
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	Wait.
		잠깐 
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	Let's just be sure.
		확실하게 하고 가자 
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:57	Large man with a gun...
		총을 가진 거구의 남자 
00:35:59	 
		 
00:36:01	Red John's girl. This is it.
		레드존의 여자, 맞다 
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:05	All right, we're moving in.
		좋아, 우리도 들어간다 
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:12	FBI. Turn off the car
		and show me your hands.
		FBI다, 시동을 끄고 내려 
		손을 머리 위로 올려라!
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:15	- FBI! Nobody move!
		- CBI! Don't shoot! We're CBI agents!
		- FBI다! 움직이지 마라! 
		- CBI다! 쏘지마라! 우린 CBI 요원들이다!
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	You're making a terrible mistake.
		Get out.
		- 지금 엄청난 실수 하시는 겁니다
		- 내려! 
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	We're in the middle
		of an operation.
		우린 작전 중이란 말입니다 
00:36:23	 
		 
00:36:23	 
		 
00:36:25	FBI!
		 FBI다! 
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:26	Turn off the car
		and show me your hands!
		 내려서 손을 머리 위로 올려 
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	- Hi.
		- Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	That the gift?
		그게 선물?
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:32	Red John in there?
		그가 안에 있는 겁니까? 
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:35	He's looking forward
		to speaking with you.
		어서 얘기 나누고 싶으시대요 
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:39	You know, Patrick,
		there's a childish hopefulness
		당신 지금 그 어린애 같은 희망 있잖아요 
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:43	about you that is
		really quite adorable.
		굉장히 사랑스러운 편이네요 
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:48	Put it on the hood.
		본네트 위에 올려놔요 
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:54	So what is it, a football?
		A cabbage?
		뭐죠? 축구공? 양배추?
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:57	Melon. Honeydew.
		멜론이요 
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:02	Organic.
		유기농이에요 
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:06	Adorable.
		사랑스러워라 
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:09	Frisk him, then beat him...
		a little.
		몸수색하고, 손 좀 봐줘. 살짝만 
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:21	Uhh!
		 
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	Well, well, well.
		이런, 이런 
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	Agent, this is a mistake.
		Agent Darcy, you don't understand.
		- 요원, 지금 실수한 겁니다 
		- 다아시 요원, 요원이 모르는게 있습니다 
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	Please, listen to me.
		No, I don't understand.
		- 제 말 좀 들어보세요 
		- 이해가 안 가네요 
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:29	You're supposed to be dead,
		as are you.
		죽었어야 하잖아요, 당신도 
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:32	This is very strange.
		참 이상들 합니다 
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:33	Susan, I am begging you.
		수잔, 내가 이렇게 빌게요 
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:35	Please listen to what
		I'm saying.
		제발 내 말 좀 들어주세요 
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	Our fake deaths were a ruse
		to trap Red John, and it worked.
		죽음을 위장한건 레드존을 잡으려는
		함정이었어요, 또 통했구요 
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:41	Jane is with him right now,
		and his life is in grave danger.
		제인은 지금 레드존과 같이 있어요,
		제인의 목숨이 위험하다구요 
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	He's at 5071 Keston Avenue.
		지금 크레스톤 가 5071번지에 있어요 
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	Uh-huh.
		 
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	That's enough.
		We haven't got much time.
		그만하면 됐어, 우리도 시간이 없어 
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	Put him
		in the passenger seat.
		조수석에 앉혀 
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:58	 
		 
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:06	Hello, Patrick.
		안녕 패트릭 
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:17	Hey.
		여 
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:19	How you doing?
		어떻게 지냈나? 
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:20	Debonair at all costs, huh?
		그 지경이 되어서도 여유작작이군
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	When did you know?
		언제부터 알았나? 
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:25	Oh, you strung me along
		for a good long while.
		꽤 오랫동안 날 갖고 놀았지 
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:28	Well done.
		참 잘했어 
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	Luckily, I have a good friend
		in the FBI,
		운좋게도 FBI에 친구가 있어서 말야 
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	so I found out
		when the FBI found out.
		FBI가 아는 거라면 나도 알게 되지 
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	Cat got your tongue?
		고양이가 혓바닥을 뽑아갔나? 
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	I have nothing to say.
		할 말이 없어 
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	Really? Nothing?
		정말? 아무것도? 
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	"Go to hell"
		goes without saying,
		"지옥에나 가라" 빼고는
00:38:46	 
		 
00:38:46	so, yes, nothing.
		뭐, 아무것도 없어 
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	As you well know, Patrick,
		there is no hell.
		자네도 잘 알겠지만 지옥이란 없어 
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:52	When I die, I won't be punished.
		내가 죽어도 벌받진 않아 
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:57	What if you really did have
		a change of heart?
		자네가 정말 마음을 바꿨다면 어땠을까? 
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	What if you and I were friends?
		나와 네가 정말 친구가 된다면? 
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	Imagine the life we could lead.
		우리가 함께 하는 삶을 생각해 봐 
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:06	It's a higher path, Patrick.
		저 높은 곳에 있는 길이지 
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:11	A nobler existence.
		더욱 고귀한 존재가 되어 
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:13	Like I said, go to hell.
		아까 말했듯, 지옥에나 가라고 
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	Oh, well, as you wish.
		원한다면 
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	Lorelei, cut off
		two of his fingers.
		로렐라이, 그의 손가락을 두개 잘라 
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	You choose which.
		Then we should go.
		손가락은 네가 골라, 그리고 떠나자 
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:34	Aah!
		 
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	I'm sorry.
		미안
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:36	Aah! Aah!
		 
00:39:39	 
		 
00:39:39	Aah!
		 
00:39:41	 
		 
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:55	 
		 
00:40:22	FBI! Turn off the vehicle!
		FBI다! 시동을 꺼라!
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:26	Let me see your hands!
		손을 이쪽으로 보여라! 
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:28	Get your hands up!
		손을 머리 위로 들어!
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:40	 
		 
00:40:42	 This 
		 call has been disconnected. 
		 통화가 끊어졌습니다 
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:45	 Please hang up 
		 and try your call again. 
		 전화기를 내려놓으신 뒤 다시 시도해 주세요 
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:48	 
		 
00:41:01	 
		 
00:41:10	You all right?
		괜찮아?
00:41:11	 
		 
00:41:11	Yeah, I'm fine.
		난 괜찮아
00:41:13	 
		 
00:41:13	Never better.
		최고야 
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:34	I'm very happy
		to meet you, Lorelei.
		만나서 반가워요 로렐라이 
00:41:37	 
		 
00:41:37	We rarely get
		the chance to talk
		레드존을 잘 아는 사람과 
00:41:39	 
		 
00:41:39	to someone who knows
		Red John so well.
		얘기하기는 참 드문 일이거든요 
00:41:42	 
		 
00:41:42	Good to meet you, too.
		나도 만나 반가워요 
00:41:44	 
		 
00:41:44	Heard so much about you.
