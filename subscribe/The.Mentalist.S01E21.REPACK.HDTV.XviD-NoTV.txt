00:00:33	but they didn't check the boat until this morning.
		보트는 오늘 아침에야 확인했대요
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	They found blood on the deck,

		마리나항구는 소살리토시에서
		개인에게 임대해 주는 항구에요
00:00:43	It was local p.d.'s decision
		whether or not to take the case.
		그래서 지역경찰이 사건을
		맡을지 여부를 결정할 수 있어요
00:00:46	Mm, a high-profile
		missing persons case.
		고위층인사 실종사건이라 말이지
00:00:49	I wonder why they wouldn't take that.
		왜 안 맡는다고 했는지 궁금해 죽겠네
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:58	You coming?
		안와?
00:00:59	He's not feeling well. Stomach.
		속이 안 좋대요
00:01:00	I'm fine.
		전 괜찮아요
00:01:01	You get me sick, i'm gonna put
		you on stakeout for a month.
		나한테 옮기면 한 달동안
		잠복근무만 시킬거야
00:01:05	Yes, boss.

00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:19	This is it?
		이게 다야?
00:01:20	Yeah.
		네
00:01:21	No sign of struggle, no weapon?
		몸싸움한 흔적도 없고 무기도?
00:01:22	Nothing.
		네 아무것도 없어요
00:01:24	What else do we know about the victim?
		피해자에 대해 그 외에 알고 있는건?
00:01:26	Jim gulbrand is 33 years old.

		1억달러 정도의 자산이 있는걸로 추정되구요
00:01:31	He's rich.
		부자네
00:01:32	Very rich.
		엄청 부자죠
00:01:33	He's also recently divorced
		from one kathryn stubbs-gulbrand.
		최근에 캐서린 스텁스-골브렌과 이혼했어요
00:01:37	Does the victim have a criminal record?
		범죄 경력은 있나?
00:01:39	No.The company he founded, gaia matrix,
		아뇨 그가 설립한 회사인 가이아 매트릭스가
00:01:43	was under investigation by the
		s.e.c.for securities violations.

		아니
00:02:03	Never mind.
		신경쓰지마
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:46	Maybe it's all just an elaborate hoax.
		어쩌면 핏자국은 조작된 것일 수도 있어요
00:02:48	That would explain why there's no body.
		시체가 없는게 설명되잖아요
00:02:50	You take a boat out, you go missing,
		보트를 끌고 나가서 실종되버리면
00:02:52	everybody assumes
		you're at the bottom of the ocean.
		사람들은 그가 바다에 빠졌다고 생각할거에요
00:02:54	Your body and yr killer
		are never to be found.
		시체랑 범인은 절대 못찾는 거죠
00:02:56	That'd make perfect sense.

		전 일종의 보안담당자이지만
		그건 너무 딱딱하게 들리죠?
00:08:13	What i am really is the firewalls and
		encryptions and off-the-wall ideas guy.

		창조적인 두뇌역할을 했어요
00:09:40	Without him, this company

		혹시 생각나는 사람은..
00:10:11	Excuse me--

00:10:13	I've thought about that
		a lot this morning, and...
		저도 오전내내 그 생각을 했죠
00:10:16	I can't think of anyone.

		of doing something so awful to him.
		누가 그에게 그런 끔찍한 짓을
		할 수 있었는지 상상이 안되요
00:10:26	Really?
		정말인가요?
00:10:27	You're a psychiatrist,
		and you can't imagine that?
		정신과 의사시니까 
		상상해 볼수 있을텐데요
00:10:30	To be more precise,
		더 정확히 말씀드리자면
00:10:31	i can't imagine a
		rational reason for wishing him dead.
		그가 죽기를 바라는 합리적인
		이유를 상상할 수가 없네요
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:35	It's, uh, standard procedure to ask--
		이건 일반적인 절차로 드리는 질문인데요
00:10:38	where where you on the night of the murder?
		살인이 일어난 날 밤에 어디 계셨나요?
00:10:40	I was here, finishing up some work.
		남은 일 마무리 하느라 여기있었어요
00:10:43	If you'd like, i could have the admin nurse send over the paperwork documenting my hours.
		바라신다면 제 근무시간을 기록한
		담당 간호사를 불러드릴 수 있어요
00:10:47	Yeah, that would be helpful.
		예 그거 도움되겠네요
00:10:48	Thank you.
		감사합니다
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	Do you have any... Leads
		on the investigation so far?
		사건에 대해 무슨 
		단서라도 있으신가요?
00:10:54	Oh, i'm sorry. We don't
		discuss our process, ma'am.
		죄송합니다 진행중인 사건에
		대해 말할수 없어서요
00:10:57	Uh, when exactly did you learn
		of your boyfriend's murder?
		정확이 언제 남자친구의 사건에 대해 아셨나요?
00:11:00	If you want to know why i'm at work the same day that my boyfriend is found dead,
		남자친구가 시체로 발견되었는데도 
		왜 계속 일하고 있었는지를 물어보시는 거면
00:11:05	Why don't you just ask me?
		그냥 물어보세요
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:07	Okay. Uh, why are you at work the same day your boyfriend is found dead?
		남자친구가 죽은채 발견됬는데도 
		왜 그 시간에 계속 일하고 있었나요?
00:11:11	I have patients who need me.
		저를 필요로 하는 환자가 있었어요
00:11:13	I have patients who need me.
		만약 제가 집에 앉아서
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	And if i had to sit at home and
		actually think about jim being... Gone...
		 
00:11:15	And if i had to sit at home and
		actually think about jim being... Gone...
		그가 죽었다는걸 되새기고 있었다면
00:11:19	I'd lose it.
		전 무너졌을거에요
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	Being here, whether it...
		여기있으면 그게 그쪽에
00:11:24	Looks good to you or not,is
		the only way i know how to cope.
		좋아보이건 나빠보이건간에
00:11:27	Looks good to you or not,is
		the only way i know how to cope.
		제가 유일하게 추스릴수 있는 방법이죠
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:31	Are you all right?
		괜찮은건가요?
00:11:32	Yeah, i'm okay.
		예
00:11:33	Uh, no. He's--he's been quite sick.
		아뇨 상당히 안좋아요
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:36	Well, let me have a look at you.
		제가 한번 볼게요
00:11:38	I'm fine.
		아 괜찮아요
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:40	Fever.
		열이나고
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:42	Nausea? Coughing?
		어지럽고 기침도 하구요?
00:11:44	Flu.
		독감이네요
00:11:46	Look, i'm not really supposed
		to do this,
		원래 이런 일을 하지는 않지만
00:11:47	but if you want, I can write a prescription for an antiviral.
		원하시면 항생제 처방전은 써드릴수 있어요
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:52	Uh, sure.
		아 물론이죠
00:11:57	Have this filled and...
		이 약을 드시면
00:11:59	You will feel better in no time.
		지내기엔 좀 수월할 거에요
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	Uh, sure. Thanks.
		감사합니다
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:10	Any word from gulbrand's partner?
		피해자의 파트너에게선 뭐 건질만한 거 없었어?
00:12:12	Not muchpin the way of motive, but he doesn't have an alibi for the night of the murder.
		그닥요 하지만 살인이 일어난 날 
		밤의 알리바이는 대지 못했어요
00:12:15	Gulbrand's brother,pon the
		other hand, checked out.
		피해자의 동생 알리바이는 확인됬어요
00:12:17	A gretchen moore says he was
		with her the night of the murder.
		그레첸 무어셋이 그날 밤 같이 있었대요
00:12:20	Roommate backs up the story.
		룸메이트가 확인해 줬구요
00:12:23	Are you still sick?
		너 아직도 아프냐?
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	Man, go see a doctor.
		의사한테 좀 가봐라
00:12:27	I did. 
		진찰받았어
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	The dead guy's girlfriend
		wrote me a prescription.
		피해자의 여자친구가 처방전을 써줬어
00:12:30	So go fill it.
		그럼 약을 드세요
00:12:31	Nah. By the time i take it,
		i'll be better.
		정 안좋으면 먹으려고
		곧 괜찮아지겠지
00:12:34	What'd she give you anyway?
		무슨 약을 처방해 줬는대요?
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:42	Oseltamivir phosphate
		Oseltamivir phosphate
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:47	May i see that?
		좀 볼 수 있을까?
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:54	Anything abouthis strike you as odd?
		이 처방전에서 이상한 거 없어?
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:59	What's odd about it?
		Oseltamivir phosphate
		뭐가 잘못됐는데요
		Oseltamivir phosphate
00:13:02	Exactly. You can read it.
		바로 정확하게 읽을 수 있다는거지
00:13:03	When was the last time you saw a doctor's handwriting that you could read?
		의사가 휘갈긴 처방전을 
		정확하게 읽어본 적 있어?
00:13:07	So she's precise.
		그래서 그 의사가 꼼꼼하다고?
00:13:08	Is that what you're implying?
		그걸 추측하라는 거야?
00:13:09	Yes, and the possibility that
		dr. Brooke harper is not a doctor.
		그렇지 그리고 닥터 하퍼가 
		닥터가 아닐 가능성도 말이지
00:13:14	Because she has penmanship skills?
		그녀가 글씨를 끝내주게 잘써서?
00:13:16	And she doesn't have that cold,
		creepy, doctor-y vibe they all have.
		그리고 의사들이 풍기는 차갑고 
		오싹한 기운같은게 없기 때문이지
00:13:19	Well, be fair. Not all
		doctors are cold and creepy.
		에..아니죠 의사들이 죄다 
		차갑고 오싹하진 않아요
00:13:22	First day of medical school, they get a stack of books and a dead human being--
		두꺼운 책들과 시체들 틈에서 
		의대생활을 하다보면
00:13:25	that, I'm afraid, will change you,
		장담하건데, 누구라도 그렇게 되
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	brooke harper was warm and emotional.
		하지만 브룩 하퍼는 따뜻하고 감성적이야
00:13:31	You like her, so she can't be a doctor.
		니 맘에 들어서 그녀가 의사일리가 없다는 거야?
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:34	Pretty much.
		바로 그거지
00:13:36	The a.m.a.and boston general both have records of a doctor named brooke harper.
		보스톤 의사협회에 브룩 하퍼라는
		이름이 등록되 있어요
00:13:40	See?
		들었지?
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:42	But it says here that
		she's 64 years old.
		근데 여기엔 나이가 64세라고 되있네요
00:13:44	She looks pretty good.
		와우 그 나이치곤 꽤 좋아보이네
00:13:47	Is there a word for
		uncanny and irritating?
		기분나쁘다랑 짜증난다를
		합친 동의어는 없니?
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:56	Jeff, i'm going to be
		leaving the clinic shortly,
		제프 제가 여기를 곧 떠나기때문에
00:13:59	So this is going to be
		our last session together.
		이번이 마지막 상담이 될겁니다
00:14:03	Oh, no, no, no.
		오..안되요
00:14:06	I-i-i need you, dr. Harper.
		전 선생님이 필요해요
00:14:07	How will i manage without you?
		선생님 없이 어떻게 지내요?
00:14:08	I'm sorry, jeff.
		정말 미안해요
00:14:09	I have enjoyed our sessions together,
		상담은 즐거웠지만
00:14:11	but i'm sure the clinic will provide you with the best care possible.
		하지만 센터에서 가능한 한 최고의 
		진료를 제공해 줄거에요
00:14:13	should you ever need to
		speak with me personally...
		하지만...
00:14:16	should you ever need to
		speak with me personally...
		필요하면 언제라도
		제게 얘기하세요
00:14:18	should you ever need to
		speak with me personally...
		개인적으로요
00:14:19	
		여기 제 전화번호에요
00:14:23	I'm very sorry to interrupt, dr. Harper,
		방해해서 죄송하지만 선생님
00:14:25	but the cbi are here again,
		and they need to speak with you.
		CBI가 다시 와서요
		선생님과 얘기하고 싶답니다
00:14:28	All right. Well, tell them i'll
		be with them in ten minutes.
		10분만 기다리라고 하세요
00:14:30	They said they need to speak 
		with you right now, 
		지금 당장 얘기해야 한다는데요
00:14:33	this moment, and they are most insistent.
		이번엔 굉장히 강압적이에요
00:14:36	Tell them i'll be right
		out, maggie. Thank you.
		바로 나간다고 전해주세요 매기
00:14:42	I feel like i'm on the verge
		of a real breakthrough. I...
		요새는 뭔가 일이 잘 풀리는 거 같아요
00:14:46	I'm starting to open myself up
		again to people in a real way.
		사람들을 대할 때 개방적으로 대하구요
00:14:48	I'm starting to open myself up
		again to people in a real way.
		상상이 아닌 실제루요
00:14:50	My inner child is finally emerging.
		제 안의 아이같은 부분이 이제야 나온 듯..
00:14:54	D-- dr. Harper?
		하퍼 선생님?
00:14:55	Dr. Harper?
		하퍼 선생님? 이봐요?
00:14:58	
		멈춰요 들어가면 안되요
00:15:04	Damn. Let's go.
		젠장
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:13	All i was able to find at
		dr. Brooke harper's apartment.
		찾을 수 있었던건 하퍼의 아파트뿐이에요
00:15:15	Bank account emptied,
		credit cards maxed out.
		은행계좌는 비었고
00:15:17	Bank account emptied,
		credit cards maxed out.
		신용카드는 정지에
00:15:18	She must have been packed
		and ready to leave days ago.
		그 여자는 아마도 하루 전에 짐 싸서 
		도망갈 준비를 해논거에요
00:15:21	Her social security number and
		medical license are fakes, too.
		사회보장번호랑 의료허가증도 가짜고
00:15:24	We have no idea who this woman is.
		이 여자가 누군지 감도 안 잡혀요
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:27	Well, we know that she's smart.
		똑똑하다는건 알지
00:15:29	She posed as a doctor for seven months, 
		managed to elude you and rigsby.
		7달 동안 의사행세도 했고
00:15:31	She posed as a doctor for seven months, 
		managed to elude you and rigsby.
		너랑 릭스비를 속이고 도망 갔잖아
00:15:32	No, she had a head start.
		She didn't elude us.
		우리가 온걸 알고 있었잖아요
		우릴 속이고 빠져나간게 아니에요
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:36	All right, she eluded us.
		알았어요 속았어요
00:15:38	Well, she's a professional conwoman.
		그녀는 전문적인 사기꾼이야
00:15:41	I mean, she probably specializes in the seduction of rich and successful, socially awkward men.
		아마도 특기는 사교성은 없지만 
		성공한 부자 유혹하기일거고
00:15:45	You think she's done this before?
		그녀가 예전에도 사기를 쳤었다고?
00:15:46	Oh, yes, many times.
		응 여러번했겠지
00:15:48	Why kill jim gulbrand?
		What's her motive?
		그럼 왜 골브렌을 죽였겠어?
00:15:50	Why kill jim gulbrand?
		What's her motive?
		동기가 뭔데?
00:15:50	Maybe he found outvthe truth about her.
		아마도 그녀에 대해 알아냈겠지요
00:15:52	Then why not just vanish?
		그럼 그냥 사라지면 되잖아
00:15:53	Good morning.
		좋은아침
00:15:55	I've been going through gulbrand's financial records and found something interesting.
		골브렌의 재정내역에 대해 알아봤는데요
00:15:57	I've been going through gulbrand's financial records and found something interesting.
		흥미로운 걸 발견했어요
00:15:59	Last year, gulbrand made a series of cash withdrawals from various accounts,
		작년에 골브렌은 꽤 많은 액수의 현금을 인출했는데요
00:16:03	totaling $10 million.
		총 천만달러 정도에요
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	What'd he spend the money on?
		어디에 썼는데?
00:16:07	That's just it. He didn't deposit it,
		아직 안 썼어요 저금도 안했고요
00:16:08	and it doesn't look like he spent it.
		어디 쓴거 같지도 않아요
00:16:10	So either he paid somebody
		off or he hid the money--
		그럼 누군가에게 지불했거나 숨긴거네
00:16:14	A cash nest egg--either from
		his ex-wife or the s.e.c.
		비상금을 만든거야
00:16:16	A cash nest egg--either from
		his ex-wife or the s.e.c.
		전처나 증권거래위원회를 피해서
00:16:18	Maybe that's what
		brooke harper was after.
		어쩌면 브룩하퍼가 그걸
		찾고 있는 걸지도 몰라요
00:16:20	If only we knew who she
		was or where she was.
		우리가 아는건 그여자가 누군지 
		어딨는지도 모른다는거지
00:16:22	Well, we know that she's ol,
		she's fearless, she's systematic.
		우리가 아는건 그녀가 쿨하고 
		겁이없고 계획적이라는거지
00:16:27	I mean, she went back to the clinic for an extra day to try and hook another sucker.
		짬을 내서 다음에 사기칠 만한
		상대을 탐색하고 있었으니까
00:16:31	She's a planner.
		그녀는 계획을 짜서 해
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:34	Could we get a copy of her
		last credit card statement?
		마지막 신용카드 명세서를 볼 수 있을까?
00:16:37	I can get it.
		뽑아올게요
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:41	And they had the nerve to send me a
		gold mercedes instead of a black one,
		그리고 감히 금색 메르세데스를
		보내온거야 검은색 대신에
00:16:44	And so i sent it back.
		그래서 바로 돌려보냈지
00:16:46	Kathryn gulbrand?
		캐서린 골브렌?
00:16:48	Kathryn stubbs-gulbrand,
		and you're interrupting.
		캐서린 스텁스-골브렌이에요
00:16:50	Kathryn stubbs-gulbrand,
		and you're interrupting.
		그리고 방해하고 있잖아요
00:16:51	'Am, we have a few questions
		regarding your ex-husband's death.
		부인 전 남편에 관해서 몇가지 질문할게 있습니다
00:16:54	Really? You wantrto talk to me now?
		정말요? 저와 얘기하겠다구요?
00:16:56	Or we can talk to you at
		the station, if you prefer.
		원하신다면 서에 가셔서 얘기하셔도 됩니다
00:16:59	Fine.
		좋아요
00:17:00	Thank you. Thank you, ladies.
		감사합니다
00:17:01	Thank you. Thank you, ladies.
		협조 감사합니다 여러분
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:09	How long had you and jim
		gulbrand been divorced?
		이혼한지 얼마나 되셨죠?
00:17:12	14 months-- that's when i moved out.
		14개월이요 그때 집을 나왔죠
00:17:15	The divorce was final a year ago.
		1년전에야 이혼이 마무리됐죠
00:17:17	Were you angrypabout the divorce?
		이혼때문에 화가 나셨나요?
00:17:18	Of course i was angry. 
		당연히 화가 났죠
00:17:19	That's usually why people get divorced.
		대부분 사람들이 이혼하는게 그 때문이잖아요
00:17:21	Court documents indicate that you sued your ex-husband on multiple occasions.
		법원 서류를 보니 남편을 여러 혐의로 고소하셨던데요
00:17:24	You bet your ass i did.
		그 인간 손 좀 봐줬죠
00:17:26	Jim tried to claim that the money that he had in gaia matrix stock wasn't actually his, But part of the company's capital.
		짐은 그가 가진 회사의 지분이 
		실제로 회사의 자금이라고 주장했어요
00:17:31	I disagreed, and i won.
		저는 동의하지 않았고
		재판에서 이겼죠
00:17:34	I got everything i wanted and more.
		요구했던 위자료보다 더 많이 받아냈어요
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:37	We have reason to believe that your ex-husband may have hidden money from you during the divorce proceedings.
		우리는 전 남편분이 이혼재판 과정중에
		돈을 숨겼을거라고 추측하고 있어요
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:42	What?
		뭐라구요?
00:17:43	He made $10 million in
		cash withdrawals last year.
		작년에 천만달러를 현금으로 인출했어요
00:17:46	You weren't aware of that?
		모르셨나요?
00:17:48	That son of a bitch.
		개자식
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:49	I knew it. I knew he was holding out.
		그럴 줄 알았어
00:17:50	I knew it. I knew he was holding out.
		그가 뭘 쥐고 있을거라고 알고 있었는데
00:17:52	That wasn't a damn
		gym locker key, was it?
		그 빌어먹을 체육관 보관함 열쇠였죠?
00:17:54	What key?
		무슨 열쇠요?
00:17:55	Last year he started wearing this key around his neck, under his shirt.
		작년에 목에 무슨 열쇠를 걸고 다니기 시작하길래
00:17:57	I asked him what it was, and he said that it was his gym locker key.
		뭐냐고 물었더니
00:17:58	I asked him what it was, and he said that it was his gym locker key.
		체육관 열쇠라더군요
00:18:01	But i knew it wasn't. I knew it.
		하지만 그게 아닌줄 알고 있었어요
00:18:02	But i knew it wasn't. I knew it.
		알고 있었다구요
00:18:03	But i knew it wasn't. I knew it.
		 
00:18:03	How perceptive.
		잘나셨네
00:18:03	 
		잘나셨네
00:18:05	What was that?
		뭐라고 했죠?
00:18:06	Oh, nothing, ma'am.
		아무것도 아닙니다 부인
00:18:07	So you didn't know
		anything about the money?
		그럼 돈에 관해 아무것도 모르시나요?
00:18:09	If i did, it wouldvbe mine right now.
		알고 있었다면 벌써 가졌겠죠
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:13	- Where is it?
		- We don't know.
		어디있나요?
00:18:14	- Where is it?
		- We don't know.
		우리도 모릅니다
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	Well, half that money's legally mine.
		그 돈의 반은 합법적으로 제꺼에요
00:18:18	I don't want jim's loser brother
		getting his loser hands on it.
		짐의 멍청한 형이 그 돈을 갖는건 말도 안되요
00:18:21	I'm sure your probate
		judge will take care of it.
		판사가 알아서 처리해 줄겁니다
00:18:23	Last friday, the, uh, night of your ex-husband's murder, where were you from 7:00 through 10:00 p.m.?
		전남편이 살해당한 금요일저녁에 
		어디에 계셨나요?
00:18:27	I was at a wine tasting in napa.
		네파의 와인시음회에 있었어요
00:18:30	Could anyone confirm that for us?
		그걸 확인해 줄 사람이 있나요?
00:18:32	Can you people charge mevwith any crime?
		지금 절 무슨 범죄혐의로 고소하는건가요?
00:18:34	- Uh, no, but-- 
		- uh, no, you can't.
		-어 아니요
		-아니 못하는 거죠
00:18:37	When you can, maybe then i'll tell
		you the details of my personal life.
		저를 고소하게 된다면
		제 사생활에 대해 자세히 말씀드리죠
00:18:40	Until then, mind your own business.
		그렇지 않다면 신경끄세요
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:47	I just got off the phone with our liaison at the s.e.c.turns out
		증권거래위원회의에서 방금 연락받았는데
00:18:50	jim gulbrand was cooperating with
		their investigation.
		짐 골브렌이 감사에 협조하고 있었대
00:18:54	Rick bregman never mentioned it.
		릭 브래드맨은 그런 얘기 안했어요
00:18:56	Make sure you mention it to him.
		그에게 그 얘기를 꺼내봐
00:18:58	What's this?
		이건 뭐야?
00:19:00	Brooke harper only used a credit card twice in the last two week this is what she bought
		브룩하퍼는 지난 2주동안
		신용카드를 딱 두번썼는데
00:19:04	In one day of shopping nine days ago,
		이쪽은 9일전 하루동안 쇼핑한 거고
00:19:07	and this is what she bought yesterday.
		이쪽은 어제 산 거야
00:19:11	Now what do these things tell us?
		자 이것들이 뭘 의미하는걸까?
00:19:13	That's a wig, by the way.
		이건 가발이야
00:19:15	What's that on the, uh, bottom right?
		저 밑에 있는건요?
00:19:16	Bandage.
		붕대
00:19:17	It doesn't look like a bandage.
		붕대 같이 생기지 않았는데요
00:19:19	It's a bandage.
		붕대 맞다고
00:19:22	What do these things tell you?
		이 물건들이 의미하는게 뭘까?
00:19:23	Brooke harper wanted to pose as a man?
		브룩 하퍼가 남장하려 한다고?
00:19:25	- Right.
		- But why?
		맞아
00:19:26	- Right.
		- But why?
		하지만 왜?
00:19:27	And what's that other stuff?
		다른 물건들은 뭔데?
00:19:29	Well, that's--that's the puzzle.
		이것들은 퍼즐이야
00:19:31	Is that kathryn stubbs?
		그 캐서린 말인데요
00:19:33	She's... 
		그녀는..
00:19:34	She's an unhappy person.
		참 우울한 여자에요
00:19:36	Where's rigsby?
		릭스비는 어딨어?
00:19:37	He went to get his prescription filled.
		처방전 약 받으러 갔어요
00:19:38	I think that kathryn woman
		actually made him worse.
		제 생각엔 그 캐서린 때문에
		릭스비선배가 더 안좋아진거 같아요
00:19:41	She's hiding something, too.
		뭔가 숨기는게 있구요
00:19:43	She wouldn't say who she was
		with the night of the murder.
		살인이 났던 밤에 뭘 했는지 
		말을 안하더라구요
00:19:45	- Keep an eye on her.
		- Interesting.
		계속 감시해봐
00:19:46	- Keep an eye on her.
		- Interesting.
		흥미롭네
00:19:47	
		네
00:19:49	She did tell us that gulbrand wore a key around his neck, that he said it was for his gym locker.
		짐이 목에 열쇠를 걸고 다녔는데
		헬스장 라커열쇠라고 했대요
00:19:53	Only there wasn't a key found on the body,as there?
		근데 시체에는 열쇠가 없었잖아요
00:19:57	
		아하!
00:19:58	She took his key.
		그녀가 열쇠를 가져갔어
00:20:00	That's why she dressed as a man, 
		그래서 남장을 하려는거야
00:20:01	so that she could get into his locker in the men's changing room of the gym.
		그래서 헬스장의 남자탈의실에가서 
		라커를 열려는거야
00:20:05	But if she had foundpjim's millions, then she would have simply vanished right then and there.
		그녀가 짐의 돈을 찾았다면
		그냥 사라지면 될텐데
00:20:09	Why stick around?
		왜 돌아다니는 거죠?
00:20:10	Because the money wasn't in the locker.
		왜냐면 돈은 보관함에 없었으니까
00:20:12	Exactly.
		맞았어
00:20:13	She's now trying to get
		inside somewhere else.
		이제 그녀는 다른 장소에 들어가려고 할거야
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:33	Thank you.

		우리가 당신을 찾은 방법을 말해주면
00:25:14	I'll tell you how we found

00:25:32	How long have you been
		a professional conwoman?
		얼마동안이나 전문사기꾼을 한거죠?
00:25:34	All my life, i suppose.
		제 평생이겠네요 아마도
00:25:36	And i confess, my
		name's not really angela.
		또 고백하는데 제 이름은 안젤라가 아니에요
00:25:40	And i didn't plant a
		g.p.s.tracking device on you.
		그리고 전 당신에게 GPS장치를 달지 안았구요
00:25:43	How then?
		그럼 어떻게한거죠?
00:25:45	Well, maybe you're not as enigmatic
		and elusive as you think you are.
		아마도 당신은 그리 교묘하지도 않고
		정체를 잘 숨기지도 못한 거겠죠
00:25:48	- I wouldn't be so sure of that.
		- No?
		확신하지 못할걸요
00:25:50	- I wouldn't be so sure of that.
		- No?
		그런가요?
00:25:52	You manipulate people because
		you take pleasure in it.
		당신을 사람들을 조종함으로써 쾌감을 느끼죠
00:25:55	You enjoy being the

00:25:58	but only so far as it allows
		you to continue conning people.
		다른 이들보다 똑똑한
		사람이라는 사실을 즐기구요
00:25:58	but only so far as it allows

00:25:58	You're interested in money, of course,
		당연히 돈에 욕심이 많지만
00:26:01	You're interested in money, of course,
		오직 사람들을 속이고
		얻는 것에만 흥미를 느끼죠
00:26:04	You allow yourself one indulgence-- 
		당신은 딱 한가지 자신에게
		허용한 사치가 있는데
00:26:06	not men, obviously.
		남자는 당연히 아니고
00:26:09	Not drinking or drugs, 
		술도 아니고 담배도 아닌데 왜냐면
00:26:11	because you fear
		that they will impair your abilities.
		당신의 능력을 저하시킨다고 두려워하기 때문이죠
00:26:14	You move around too much to have a pet.

		그래서 추측해보면
00:26:19	Chocolate.

00:26:22	You're good.
		실력 좋으시네요
00:26:24	So why do you do this, brooke?
		그래서 왜 이런 짓을 하는거죠?
00:26:26	Neglected as a child?
		어린시절의 무관심때문에?
00:26:27	Is this your way of getting attention?
		이런식으로 관심을 끄나요?
00:26:31	Or is it something a little darker?
		아니면 좀더 어두운 기억이 있나요?
00:26:33	Just a genuine mystery, i suppose.
		정말 수수께끼같네요 그렇죠?
		(just a genuine mistery I suppose)
00:26:35	Well, we have your prints now, so
		we'll know who you are soon enough.
		지문을 검색해보면 당신이 누군지 알수 있겠죠
00:26:38	Do you think one can ever
		truly know another person?
		다른사람을 진실로 알 수 있다고 생각하나요?
00:26:42	I doubt it.
		전 그렇게 생각 안해요
00:26:44	How do you come to have jim
		gulbrand's key in your possession?
		짐의 열쇠는 어떻게 가지게 된건가요?
00:26:46	He gave it to me.
		그가 줬어요
00:26:47	Didn't tell you what it would unlock?
		어디 열쇠인지는 말 안하던가요?
00:26:48	It wasn't given as a real
		key. It was a symbol...
		진짜 열쇠로서 준건 아니에요 상징적인거죠
00:26:51	Of our love.
		우리 사랑에 관한
00:26:52	It's the key to his heart.
		마음의 열쇠에요
00:26:54	You said "our love" with conviction.
		'우리의 사랑'이라고 말했는데
00:26:56	You said "our love" with conviction.
		그건 고백인가요?
00:26:59	Are you trying to tell us
		that you loved him, too?
		진실로 그를 사랑했다고 말하고 있는 건가요?
00:27:01	Yes, to my great surprise.
		네 저도 놀랐지만
00:27:04	I did come to love him, in a way.
		그를 진실로 사랑하게 됐어요
00:27:07	- He was a good, kind man.
		- So sweet.
		그는 친절하고 좋은 사람이었어요
00:27:09	- He was a good, kind man.
		- So sweet.
		정말 감동적이네요
00:27:10	Yes, it is.
		그러게요
00:27:11	Yes, this is also the key to a
		locker that holds $10 million.
		이건 마음의 열쇠이면서 천만달러가
		있는 보관함의 열쇠이기도 하죠
00:27:15	Really? I thought it was for cigars.
		정말요? 전 시가보관함인줄 알았는데요
00:27:17	- I love a good cigar.
		- Nope. $10 million.
		전 좋은 시가를 좋아하거든요
00:27:18	- I love a good cigar.
		- Nope. $10 million.
		아뇨 천만달러에요
00:27:21	But that's just silly.

		million in a locker?
		왜 짐이 천만달러나 되는 돈을 보관함에 두겠어요?
00:27:27	- She's good.
		- Yeah, she is.
		실력 좋네
00:27:28	- She's good.
		- Yeah, she is.
		네 그러네요
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:32	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐하세요?
00:27:33	Duh, looking for the money.
		보면 몰라요? 돈 찾고 있잖아요
00:27:35	Rick figured maybe there were secret compartments on the boat or something.
		릭은 아마도 시가 보관함이나 배에 있을거라고 하던데
00:27:39	How long have you been seeing
		rick bregman romantically?
		릭과 얼마나 오랫동안 로맨틱한 관계셨나요?
00:27:42	About a year.
		한 일년 정도요
00:27:43	You were divorced from jim
		gulbrand about a year ago.
		일년 전에야 이혼하셨는데
00:27:46	Were you and rick involved while
		you were still married to jim?
		이혼전부터 깊은 사이셨나요?
00:27:49	Involved?
		깊은 사이요?
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:51	Were you having sexual
		intercourse with him?
		그와 성관계를 맺으셨나요?
00:27:54	No. Rick would never do that to jim.
		아뇨 릭은 짐한테 그런 짓 못해요
00:27:56	But you would.
		하지만 당신은 할 수 있죠
00:27:57	I ha needs just like anybody else.
		다른 사람들처럼 저도 욕구가 있을 뿐이죠
00:27:59	I refuse to be ashamed of my needs.
		그런 욕구를 가진게 부끄럽지도 않구요
00:28:01	Then why did you lie to
		us about your relationship?
		왜 두분의 관계에 대해 거짓말을 하셨죠?
00:28:04	Because i knew how it would look.
		왜냐면 어떻게 보일지 아니까요
00:28:06	You knew it'd make you
		look guilty of jim's murder?
		두 분의 관계때문에 짐을
		살해했다는 것처럼 보인다는 말인가요?
00:28:08	No. Yes. It's just...
		아뇨. 이건 단지...
00:28:13	It wasn't just that. Gaia matrix's stock has been falling for months.
		그런게 아니에요 회사 주식이
		몇달간 계속 떨어지고 있어요
00:28:16	This market has hurt even
		the best of companies.
		시장이 안좋아서 우량회사들
		주가도 떨어지는 상황이에요
00:28:19	This market has hurt even
		the best of companies.
		제가 가장 원치 않았던 건 상황을 
		더 나쁘게 만드는 섹스 스캔들이었어요
00:28:20	The last thing i need issome "page six" sex scandal to make things worse.
		제가 가장 원치 않았던 건 상황을 
		더 나쁘게 만드는 섹스 스캔들이었어요
00:28:22	So you misled us in order
		to protect your money.
		그래서 당신 돈을 보호하기
		위해 우리에게 거짓말을 한거구요
00:28:25	I misled you to protect the company that jim and i built from the ground up.
		당신들에게 거짓말을 한건 짐과 내가
		바닥에서부터 세운 회사를 보호하기 위해서였어요
00:28:29	Were you aware that jim gulbrand was
		cooperating with s.e.c.investigators?
		짐이 sec감사에 협조하는걸 알고 계셨나요?
00:28:33	Jim would never go
		behind my back like that.
		짐은 내 뒤에서 그런짓 안해요
00:28:35	Well, he would, and he did.
		아뇨 했어요 문제는
00:28:37	The question is, if you found
		out, what would you do to stop him?
		당신이 그 사실을 알게됬을때
		그에게 무슨 짓을 했냐는 거죠
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:42	This conversation is over.
		더 이상 할 말 없습니다
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:45	When did you find out about
		the $10 million he was hiding?
		숨겨진 천만달러에 대해 어떻게 알게 되셨나요?
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:48	Over.
		할 말 없어요
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:55	$10 million? 
		천만 달러요?
00:28:57	That's a lot of money.
		굉장히 많은 돈이네요
00:28:59	Jim trusted you with the
		security of his company.
		짐은 보안담당자로 당신을 믿었어요
00:29:01	He valued your, uh,
		outside-the-box thinking.
		당신의 고정관념을 벗어난 사고를 높이 샀죠
00:29:05	You advised him on what to
		do with the money, didn't you?
		당신이 그에게 돈을 어디에
		숨겨야 할지 알려줬죠?
00:29:09	Didn't you?
		그렇죠?
00:29:10	We don't care if hiding the
		money was legal or unethical.
		자금 은닉이 불법인지 아닌지에 관해선 신경안써요
00:29:13	Our focus is the homicide investigation.
		우리는 살인사건에만 관심이 있어요
00:29:16	I-it's not that. It's just...
		그런게 아니에요
00:29:20	I absolutely promised jim
		i wouldn't say anything.
		짐한테 절대 말 안겠다고 맹세했어요
00:29:25	We found out jim's girlfriend,
		brooke harper, is a conwoman.
		우리는 짐의 여자친구 브룩 하퍼가
		사기꾼이라는걸 알아냈어요
00:29:28	We think she was after the money and
		might have murdered jim to get it.
		그녀가 돈을 쫓다가 짐을 살해했다고 생각해요
00:29:32	We found her, along with this key, trying to open gulbrand's cabinet at the backgammon club.
		그녀가 짐의 회원제 클럽
		보관함을 열려고 하는걸 붙잡았어요
00:29:38	The key didn't work.
		열쇠는 맞지 않았어요
00:29:39	Evidently, she took it from jim, but
		she doesn't know where the money is.
		명백한건 그녀가 짐에게서 열쇠를 훔치긴 했지만
00:29:41	Evidently, she took it from jim, but
		she doesn't know where the money is.
		어디 열쇠인지는 몰랐다는 거죠
00:29:44	That's some lady.
		굉장한 여자네요
00:29:46	If you help us find the money, we can prove that brooke was looking for it,
		우리가 돈 찾는걸 도와주시면
00:29:48	If you help us find the money, we can prove that brooke was looking for it,
		브룩이 돈을 찾고 있었다는걸 증명할 수 있고
00:29:50	And establish a motive for murder.
		살인죄도 성립되죠
00:29:52	So, stuart, 
		그러니까 스튜어트
00:29:53	do you know where the money is?
		돈이 어딨는지 알아요?
00:29:55	No.
		아뇨
00:29:58	Well, n-not exactly, anyway.
		정확하게는 몰라요
00:30:00	Jim did come to me for some
		out-of-the-box security advice.
		짐이 보안문제에 관해
		조언을 구하러 왔었어요
00:30:05	Like you said, he wanted to
		hide the money from his ex-wife.
		전처에게서 돈을 숨기고 싶다구요
00:30:07	I told him that safety deposit boxes and offshore accounts could be traced rather easily, So they wouldn't be of any use.
		그래서 전 은행금고나 해외계좌는 
		추적당하기 쉬워서 쓸모없다고 말해줬어요
00:30:13	So where'd you tell him to hide it?
		그래서 어디에 숨기라고 말해줬나요?
00:30:14	Off the grid.
		상식에서 벗어난 곳에 숨기라구요
00:30:16	Out of the financial institutions, any place a trail couldn't be established.
		금융회사는 피하라구요
		흔적을 남길 수 있으니까요
00:30:20	Like a home safe?
		집안이 금고같은?
00:30:21	No. Anything on his property
		is subject to search.
		아뇨 사적 소유물은 추적가능해요
00:30:23	No, it had to be secure--
		그런건 보안장치를 해야하잖아요
00:30:26	obviously, hence the key--
		열쇠만 있으면 되요
00:30:27	But more importantly, it had to be a place that no one would think to look.
		제일 중요한건 아무도
		생각지 못한 장소여야 해요
00:30:30	- Hidden in plain sight.
		- Yes.
		평범한 장소에 숨겨라?
00:30:31	- Hidden in plain sight.
		- Yes.
		네
00:30:33	But that's the extent of my involvement.
		그게 제가 말해준 전부에요
00:30:34	I have no idea where he
		actually hid the money.
		그가 실제로 어디에 숨겼는지는 몰라요
00:30:36	Oh, yeah. I see.
		아 알겠네요
00:30:44	Don't want to go losing that, now do we?
		이걸 잃어버리면 안되겠죠?
00:30:48	What do you make of it?
		무슨 일을 꾸미는거야?
00:30:50	You think he knows
		where jim hid the money?
		그가 돈이 숨겨진 곳을 알고 있다고 생각해?
00:30:51	I think he knows the general whereabouts of the money,
		그가 돈이 숨겨진 대략적인 장소는 안다고 생각해
00:30:54	but he doesn't know exactly.
		하지만 정확한 장소는 모르지
00:30:56	And the devil is in
		the details, isn't he?
		절대 자세히 말하지는 않네, 그렇지?
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:12	- Here's what happened.
		- I'm all ears.
		사건이 일어난 경위는 이래요
00:31:13	- Here's what happened.
		- I'm all ears.
		말해보세요
00:31:15	Two weeks ago, you took the locker key from around jim's neck when he was sleeping
		2주전에 당신은 짐이 자고 있을때
		그의 목에서 열쇠를 빼냈어요
00:31:20	And replaced it with an identical one 
		그리고는 가짜 열쇠로 바꿔치기 해놨죠
00:31:22	so jim was none the wiser.
		그래서 짐은 더이상 당신보다
		우월한 사람이 아니게 된거죠
00:31:24	Then when you tried to open the
		locker at the gym, the key didn't fit.
		그리고 체육관의 라커를
		 열려고 했지만 맞지 않았죠
00:31:28	So the money was hidden
		somewhere else, 
		돈은 다른 곳에 숨겨져 있던거에요
00:31:29	but where?
		하지만 어디냐는게 문제죠
00:31:31	Last friday, you got impatient, 
		지난 금요일에 당신은 참을성이 바닥나서
00:31:33	and you pushed jim to tell you where he'd hidden the money.
		짐에게 돈이 숨겨진 곳을 추궁했어요
00:31:36	Jim wouldn't tell you. 
		You got mad, and you killed him.
		짐이 말하지 않자 화가 나서
		그를 죽인거에요
00:31:40	No.
		아니에요
00:31:41	You probably didn't do it on purpose,
		아마 그러려고 했던건 아닐거에요
00:31:43	did you? It was an accident.
		그렇죠? 그건 사고였어요
00:31:45	It wasn't. I didn't do it.
		아니에요. 전 안했어요
00:31:49	Sad thing is,
		안타까운건 말이죠
00:31:51	with all your skills,
		그 모든 노력에도 불구하고
00:31:53	the answer was right
		there in front of you.
		진실은 바로 당신 앞에 있었어요
00:31:57	You just didn't see it.
		당신은 그걸 못 본거죠
00:32:01	You didn't do enough research.
		충분한 조사를 안했던 거에요
00:32:03	You're playing me.
		절 가지고 노시는 군요
00:32:05	You don't know either.
		당신도 모르잖아요
00:32:07	Jim's security systems are all
		designed by the same man at gaia matrix.
		짐의 보안시스템은 모두 한 사람이 설계했죠
00:32:10	Stuart hanson.
		스튜어트 핸슨요?
00:32:11	Him.
		네 그사람이요
00:32:12	He suggested where to put the money.
		그가 돈을 어디에 숨길지 제안해줬어요
00:32:14	You could have squeezed the truth
		out of him very swiftly, i imagine--
		당신은 그에게서 순식간에
		알아낼 수도 있었어요
00:32:18	Putty to a woman like you-- 
		당신같은 여자라면..
00:32:19	but instead,
		하지만 대신에
00:32:21	you had to kill a man.
		사람을 죽여야 했죠
00:32:23	I wouldn't do that.
		저라면 그렇게 안해요
00:32:25	You don't know me.
		절 모르시네요
