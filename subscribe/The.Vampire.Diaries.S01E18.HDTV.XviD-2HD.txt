00:00:00	Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
		지난 이야기.
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	For over a century, I have lived in secret...
		여태껏 비밀을
		간직한채 살았다
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	Until now. I know the risk, and I have to know her.
		위험한 건 알지만
		그녀를 알아야 한다
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
		엘레나
		캐더린과 똑닮았더군
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	- Where is he? - They have him. I can't get in.
		- 어디있죠?
		- 들어갈 수가 없어
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	Who says we're not here for revenge, right?
		복수 때문에
		부활한게 아니랬어
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	That's exactly what we're here for.
		하지만 바로
		복수를 위한거야
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	Can you make it?
		갈 수 있겠어?
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:18	Take my wrist. You need more blood.
		내 손목을 물어
		피가 필요하니
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:22	Stefan, he's dead.
		스테판
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:26	You were like this other person.
		다른 사람 같았어
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Everything's gonna be ok.
		괜찮아질거야
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:31	They found Vicki Donovan. A storm unearthed the grave off county road.
		비키 도노반의 시신이
		산길에서 발견되었네
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	She's dead? 
		세상을 떠났다구요?
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:51	Could you turn it up a little bit? It's not annoying yet.
		볼륨 좀 안 낮출래?
		짜증나려고 한다
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Sorry.
		미안
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:59	- When you goin' back to school?
		- Soon.
		- 학교는 언제가려고?
		- 곧
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:02	Oh, come on. Just drink already.
		그냥 마셔
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:06	Come on.
		어서
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:08	This self-detox is unnatural.
		디톡스 다이어트는
		도에 어긋나는 짓이야
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:10	Could you get that away from me, please?
		제발 좀 비켜줄래?
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:12	How long did it take you to wean yourself off of it after you last indulged?
		사람 피를 맛본 후
		끊는데 얼마나 걸렸지?
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:17	That's not good.
		걱정인데
00:01:18	 
		 
00:01:18	Be fine. It just takes a little bit of time.
		괜찮을거야
		시간이 좀 필요해
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:20	I don't get it. You know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for.
		이해가 안돼
00:01:21	I don't get it. You know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for.
		생존을 위해
		살인을 할 필요는 없어
00:01:22	I don't get it. You know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for.
		 
00:01:22	I don't get it. You know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for.
		그래서 혈액은행이 있잖니
00:01:24	I don't get it. You know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for.
		 
00:01:24	 
		 
00:01:24	I haven't hunted a human in...gahh... way too long.
		난 인간을 사냥한지
		정말 꽤.. 됐군
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	Oh, I'm impressd.
		놀라운데
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:29	It was completely self-serving.
		내 계획 때문이었지
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:32	Trying tgetthe town off the trail
		of vampires,which is not very easy,
		뱀파이어의 흔적을 지우는건
		별로 쉽지 않았어
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	considering there'san entire
		tomb of them running around.
		무덤 전체가 마을을
		활보하는걸 감안하면
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	What are we planningon doing about that?
		그건 어쩔거야?
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	We're not gonna be doingmuch of
		anything if you don't haveyour strength.
		너에게 힘이 없는 한은
		우린 아무것도 못할거야
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:43	There's nothing wrongwith partaking in a
		healthy dietof human blood from a blood bank.
		혈액은행에서 인간 피라는
		건강한 식단을 하는건 나쁜게 아냐
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:48	You're not actuallylling anyone.
		사람을 실제로
		죽이는 건 아니잖아
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:49	I have my reasons.
		나한텐 다른 이유가 있어
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:51	Well,what arethose
		holier-than-thou reasons?
		당신의 신성한 이유가 무엇이시길래?
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:52	You know,we've
		neveractually discussed that.
		여태껏 얘기 안해줬잖아
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	You know,i-i'd loveto hear this story.
		정말 듣고 싶은데
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:58	You're reallyenjoying this,aren't
		you,just watching mein a struggle?
		즐기는구나? 내가
		고통스러워하는걸 지켜보는거
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:02	Very much so.
		많이 그렇지
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	I hate to break itto you,damon,but--ahem--i
		actually have itunder complete control.
		솔직히 말하고 싶지 않았는데
		난 완벽히 자제 중이야
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	You do?
		그러셔?
00:02:11	 
		 
00:02:11	well,then youshould just carry on
		making the restof us vampires look bad.
		그럼 계속해서 우리 나머지
		뱀파이어들을 악당처럼 보이게 하셔
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:20	Have a great day,stef.
		즐거운 하루 보내, 스테판
00:02:22

00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	She finallywent to her
		dad's,which is a good thing,
		결국 아버님 댁으로 갔어
		그래서 다행이지
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	because my mom was gonna strangle
		her if she dropped offmore lasagna.

		어떻게 숲속에
		매장되어 있던걸까?
00:05:06

		거기다 내버려두지
		묻을 시간은 없을거라고
00:05:12

		뭔가 보고..
00:05:14

00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	I wish it were underbetter

		설립자 가족의 회원으로서
		상황이 더 나았다면 좋았으련만
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	I find it's my dutyto report
		some very distressing news.
		끔찍한 소식을 보고 드리는게
		제 임무라 느꼈습니다
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	He's a gilbert?
		길버트가 사람인가요?
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	Elena's uncle.His name's
		john,buti call him jackass.
		엘레나 삼촌이야
		싸가지가 없지
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	A hospital blood bankin the
		neighboring county of amherst
		동네 근처에 위치한
		병원의 혈액고에
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	has reportedseveral break-ins
		over the past 2 weeks.
		지난 2주간 도난 사고가
		여러번 있었습니다

		have been reportedmissing as well,
		또한 7명의 사냥꾼과,4명의 캠프객
		2명의 시공무원이 실종되었죠
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	all of this within a 75-mile
		radius of mystic falls.
		모두 미스틱 폴즈에서 반경
		75마일 근처에서 일어났습니다
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	Okay...no need to get
		alarmed right at this mont.
		좋아요.. 당장은
		걱정할 필요 없소
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	Meaning he doesn't wanna cancel
		the founder's day kick-off party.
		설립자 기념일 축하 파티를
		취소하고 싶지 않으시단 뜻이야
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	You think all of your problems are over,
		여러분 모두 문제가
		다 해결됐다 생각하시겠지만
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	but I'm here to tell you
		nothing's been solved.
		아무것도 해결되지 않았단걸
		말씀드리려 여기 온겁니다
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:30	I made a copy of a paper
		that jeremy wrote for me.
		제레미가 냈던
		리포트를 가져왔어
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:34	I think you should take a look it.
		너도 읽어봐야 할 것 같더구나
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:38	@@/****@@\
		'미스틱 폴즈의
		뱀파이어에 대한 진실'
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	Jeremy wrote this?
		제레미가 썼다구요?
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:43	He's very clear that he
		didn't think it was real.
		뱀파이어란 존재하지 않는단걸
		분명하게 밝혔지
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	I really hope you're right,because I've
		done so much to protect him from all this.
		선생님이 맞길 바래요
		감추려고 노력을 많이 했으니까요
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:55	So how do you deal with it?
		어떻게 감당하나?
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:58	Wh do you mean?
		무슨 말씀이죠?
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	I don't know.with all
		the lies and the secre.
		글쎄다. 거짓말과 비밀들말야
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	You have to lie to everye
		who's important to you.
		소중한 모두에게
		거짓말을 해야하잖니
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	It's not safe for
		them to know the truth,
		사실을 알면
		위험해져요
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:09	so,yes,I keep it from them,but
		it's only because I love them.
		그러니까 비밀로 하죠
		사랑해서 그러는 거에요
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:16	I think stefan's a good guy,.
		스테판은 괜찮은 남자 같아
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	But...At the end of the
		day,he's still a vampire.
		하지만 결국엔
		스테판도 뱀파이어야
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	I know it's hard to
		understand,but stefan's different.
		이해하기 힘들겠지만
		스테판은 달라요
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:29	He would never do anything to hurt me.
		나한테 상처줄 일은
		절대 안할거에요
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:33	I have no interest in the
		founder's day kick-off party.
		난 설립기념일
		축하파티엔 관심 없어요
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	Sure,you do.it's tradition.
		관심을 가져야지
		전통인데
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	Far be it for us to
		break from tradition.
		우리 가족은
		전통과는 거리가 머니까
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	The gilberts have been a part of this town
		for 150 years,one of the founding families,
		설립자 가문에서 시작해서 우리
		길버트가는 150년간 이 마을의 일부였지
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	and with that distinction comes certain
		obligations,including going to the party.
		그러한 이유 때문에 파티에
		참석하는 등의 특정한 의무가 있어
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:52	One da when you can appreciate the
		significance,I'll tell you all about your heritage.
		언젠가 이러한 의의를 헤아리게 되면
		우리 가문의 모든걸 알려주마
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:57	the gilbert family legacy.
		길버트가의 유산이라
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	I forgot how sacred it was.
		정말 신성하지
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	I'm not a gilbt,so I was
		never cool enough to hear it.
		난 길버트가가 아니라서
		그걸 들을 자격이 못됐고
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:05	Why does she hate you?
		이모는 왜 아저씨를 미워하죠?
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	We used to sleep together.
		같이 자던 사이었거든
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:10	I'm standing right here.
		나 바로 여기 있다구
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:13	Why would he write a report on vampires?
		왜 뱀파이어에 대해서
		리포트를 썼을까?
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:17	Do you think he's starting to remember?
		기억이 들기 시작한거 같아?
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	Damon took away those memories for
		good.You don't have to worry about that.
		데이먼은 완벽히 기억을 지웠어
		그건 걱정 안해도 돼
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:23	Tell you what.why
		don't you just ask him?
		있잖아. 그냥
		직접 물어보는게 어때?
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:27	- I...i can't.
		- Why not?
		- 못.. 하겠어
		- 왜?
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	I mean,if he doesn't know anything,then
		it's just a-an innocent question.
		아무것도 모른다면
		그냥 순수한 질문이 되잖아
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:35	I don't even know how
		to talk to him anymore.
		어떻게 얘기를 꺼낼지 모르겠어
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	I mean,we used to be a lot
		more open with each other,
		한때는 서로 많은걸 털어놨었는데
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:42	but now,with all these
		secrets just piling.
		이제는 비밀이 쌓여만 가니까
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:46	You know,I haven't even told
		him that I'm adopted yet.
		내가 입양됐단 것도
		아직 말 못했어
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:51	Maybe it's time you start
		opening up to him again.
		다시 마음을 열 때야
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:54	I'm not saying you should
		tell him everything,
		모든걸 말하라는 뜻은 아니고
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	but at least try to find out what
		he does know and be prepared for it.
		최소한 뭘 아는지 알아내고
		준비하는 게 좋잖아
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:03	What about you?how are you doing?
		너는? 좀 어때?
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	I'm much,much better.
		난 훨씬.. 나아졌어
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	Yeah,I'm--i'm still,you know,a
		little,uh-- a little jitte,
		아직.. 약간은..
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:13	I'm--i'm
		gonna be ok.
		곧 좋아질거야
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	I've been really worried
		about you,and I missed you.
		요즘 정말 걱정했어
		보고싶었고
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	I just needed to lay low for a little
		while,and,uh,let my body readjust.
		잠시동안 조용히 있어야겠어
		내 몸도 다시 적응하게끔
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	It's only been a few days.
		며칠밖에 안지났잖아
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:27	It feels like a lifetime.
		평생같이 느껴졌어
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:33	I've missed you,too.
		나도 보고 싶었어
00:09:35	 
		 
00:10:12	Stefan,what's wrong?
		스테판, 왜 그래?
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:16	Stefan.
		스테판
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:35	Oh,good.you're here.
		여기 있어서 다행이네요
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	You ask,I come.I'm easy like that.
		부르면 온다
		난 그렇게 간단하지
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:42	Go to your bedroom with you.
		아니, 난 네 침실엔 안갈거야
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:51	Just like I remembered.
		내 기억과 똑같군
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	Stop messing around.
		이제 장난은 그만쳐요
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:59	You know,did you know that your uncle's
		been kickin' it with the founder's uncil?
		네 삼촌이 설립자 의회에도
		참견하는 거 알고 있니?
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	What?
		뭐라구요?
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:05	we'll just add it to the growing list
		of how everything's falling apart.
		우리 가문의 타락 명단에
		추가시켜야겠네
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:10	What happened right there?
		저건 어떻게 된거야?
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	Uh,nothing.
		아무것도 아녜요
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:17	Look,damon,i-i'm worried about stefan.
		데이먼, 난 스테판이 걱정돼요
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	He says that everything's
		ok,but he's clearly struggling.
		모두 괜찮을거랬는데
		정말 힘들어해요
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	How long iit gonna take
		before he's back to normal?
		정상으로 돌아오는데
		얼마나 걸릴까요?
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	- Few days,give or take.
		- It's beea few days.
		- 며칠 걸릴거야
		- 꽤 지났는데요
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	Give then.I don't know.
		그럼 모르겠다
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	What's the big deal?
		뭐 그리 대수라고?
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	He's not himself,damon.
		스테판답지 않다구요
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	Well,maybe his problem is is he's
		spent too long not being himself.
		자신답지 않게 오랫동안
		살아왔던게 문제였을거야
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:42	please don't make me
		sorry for asking you.
		당신한테 물은걸
		유감으로 생각하고 싶지 않은데
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	It is what it is,elena.
		어쩔수 없는 일인걸
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:46	The stefan you know was "good
		behavior" stefan,"reign it in" stefan,"
		네가 아는 스테판은
		'행실바르고 자제력있고'
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	fight against his nature to an
		annoyingly obsessive level" stefan,
		'강박관념 정도로 짜증나게
		자신의 천성에 맞서는' 스테판이었어
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	but if you think there's
		not another part to this,
		하지만 다른 면이 있단걸
		기대 못했다면
00:11:56	 
		 
00:11:56	then you have not been paying attention.
		확실히 주의깊게
		관찰하지 못했구나
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:00	He's not you,not even close.
		스테판은 당신이 아녜요
		전혀 다르죠
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	Well,he doesn't wanna be me.
		나처럼 되고 싶어하지 않지
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:05	But that doesn't mean
		deep down that he's t.
		하지만 그렇다고 마음속 깊이
		나같은 면이 없으리란 법 없잖아
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:51	What's up?
		무슨 일이야?
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:53	Do you have some time to talk?
		얘기 좀 할래?
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	Uh,yeah,sure.
		물론
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	Not here.
		네 방에서 말고
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Come on.let's get out of the house.
		나가서 얘기 좀 하자
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:05	I just can't believe mom and dad
		never told you that you were adopted.
		엄마 아빠가 누나 입양된걸
		얘기 안해줬었다니
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	I'm sure they would have eventually.
		차차 말씀하시려고 했을거야
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Why were y worried about what I thought?
		왜 내 생각을 걱정해?
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	c
		왜냐면.. 이상하잖아
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	Going your whole life thinking
		you're related blood to someone.
		평생을 누군과와
		같은 핏줄이라 생각했는데
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:22	Does it bug you that we're not?
		우리가 다른 핏줄이라
		신경쓰여?
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:24	No,You're my brother.that's
		all that matters.
		아니, 넌 내 동생이야
		그게 제일 중요하지
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:30	saltzman said you've been
		doing great in history now.
		선생님이 그러던데
		역사 성적이 좋다며
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	yeah,he's really been helpin' me out.
		많이 도와주고 계셔
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	He gave me some extra creditnd stuff.
		추가 학점도 주셨어
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	He loved your vampire paper.
		네 뱀파이어 리포트가
		맘에 드신다던데
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:42	Yeah,he thought I had a clever angle.
		내 시각이 훌륭했대
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	What drew you to that subject matter?
		어떤 이유로
		그런 주제에 끌린거야?
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Uh,I don't know.um,boredom.
		모르겠어
		지루해서
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	Or maybe I'm just as nuts as
		the long line of gilbert crazies.
		아니면 나는 길버트가의
		미치광이들만큼 미쳤나봐
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	The gilberts aren't crazy.
		길버트 가문은 미친게 아냐
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	Ah,easy for you to say.you're not one.
		말하기 쉽겠지
		길버트가가 아니니까
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:58	Ouch.
		아야
00:13:59	 
		 
00:14:14	oh,god.
		이런
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	I shouldn't be here.
		와서는 안되는건데
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	Come on.don't be a downer.
		어서 가자
		우울하게 만들지마
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	It's a party for the founding families.
		설립기념일 파티
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	it would be rude to skip it.
		그냥 넘어가는게 무례한거지
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:24	You know,i--i really liked you a whole
		lot better when you hated everybody.
		모두를 미워할때가
		더 맘에 들었는데
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	Oh,I still do.****
		아직도 증오해
		하지만 다들 날 사랑하는걸
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:34	- how you feelin'?
		- I'm good.I'm fine.
		- 기분이 어때'?
		- 괜찮아
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	No cravings?no urges?
		갈망이나 충동은 없는거야?
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:39	Has that whiskey you been
		drinkin' all day doin' its job?
		하루종일 위스키 마시니
		도움이 좀 되던?
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:43	We are who we are,stan.
		우린 어쩔수 없는 존재인걸
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	Pretending doesn't change that.
		가장한다고 바뀌지 않아
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	Ah,nothing would make you happier
		than to just see me give in,huh,damon?
		내가 굴복하는 거 보는것만큼
		즐거운 것도 없지, 형?
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	Whatev.it's inevitable.
		아무렴
		피할 수 없는걸
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:53	M gonna go find elena.
		엘레나 찾을거 갈게
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	Don't embarrass me,young man.
		쪽팔리는 짓 하지 마렴
00:14:56	 
		 
00:15:08	I'm so glad u could join us tonight.
		와줘서 고맙소
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	It was nice of you to reach out to us.
		저희한테 연락주셔서 감사해요
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	This town is e big family,and
		when we lose a member,
		이 마을은 대가족과 같죠
		가족의 일원을 잃으면
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	we all have to come together.
		모두 함께 위로하는게 도리죠
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	Matt.kel.
		그럼 가보겠소
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:27	Well,I guess dead kid rates a
		special greeting from the mayor,huh?
		아이가 죽은게 시장님의
		특별 방문할만큼의 가치가 있나보네
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	Go mom.
		왜 그래요, 엄마
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	I need a dnk.
		한 잔 좀 해야겠다
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:36	hey,check it out.
		이것 좀 봐
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:39	Dude,your dad's gonna beat
		you down if he catches you.
		이러다가 너희 아버지한테
		걸리면 죽도록 맞을걸
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	Yeah,let him try.
		어디 잡아보라지
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	All right,screw it.
		알았어, 마시자
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:55	how are you?
		엘레나
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:58	Are you drunk?
		너 취했니?
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:03	Ok,I know it's a little
		weird,but it's really helping me.
		좀 이상하지
		하지만 도움이 되고 있어
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:07	Takes the edge off.
		무디게 만들어주지
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	You're totally that drunk high school
		guy at the party sneaking booze.
		넌 파티에 몰래 술을 가져온
		술취한 고등학교 남학생같잖아
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	I tolly am.
		정확히 맞는데
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	How worried do I need to be?
		걱정 해야하나?
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	Oh,no.you don't need to be worried.
		걱정할 필요 없어
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	It's just until,um,the cravings go away.
		그냥 내 식욕이 사라질때까지만
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	Listen.
		있지
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	how about we enjoy it while it lasts?
		끝날때까지
		즐기는 게 어때?
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Would you like to dance with me?
		나랑 같이 춤 출래?
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	you hate dancing.I
		usually have to beg you.
		춤 싫어하잖아
		내가 빌어서 같이 춰줬고
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	No,no,no.you have to beg the sober me.The
		drunk me,there's no begging necessary.
		아니, 술 안취했을땐 그렇지만
		술취했을때는 간청할 필요 없어
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:38	There's really no one dancing.
		춤추는 사람도 없는데
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	That's because they need
		something better to dance to.
		맞춰서 춤출 만한
		음악이 필요하니까
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	Be right back.
		곧 돌아올게
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:47	Yeah,that's not gonna work.
		안통할걸
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	I already tried to bribe the
		guy with 20 bucks and a date.
		이미 DJ한테 20달러랑
		맞선놔준다고 꼬셔봤어
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	He said carol lockwood has complete
		control over the music choices.
		음악 선택권은 락우드
		여사님한테 있다더구나
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:57	You'd be surprised what stefan can
		accomplish when he puts his mind to it.
		스테판이 마음만 먹으면
		어떻게 되는지 놀라실걸요
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:05	thank god.
		다행이군
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:13	Have I entered an alternate
		universe where stefan is fun?
		스테판이 즐긴다니
		내가 다른 세상에 온건가?
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:18	Is he gonna be ok?
		괜찮을까요?
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:21	Eventually.
		언젠가는
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	One way or another.
		어떻게든 말이지
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:37	histy teacher,3 o'clock.
		3시 방향에
		역사 선생님 오신다
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:40	How do I look?
		나 어떠니?
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	beautiful.
		예뻐
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	Ah,I been lookin' for you.
		찾아다녔어요
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	Here I am.
		바로 여기 있답니다
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:47	I haven't seen you in a while.
		오랫만이네요
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	well,uh,things have been a little crazy.
		요즘 좀 정신이 없어서
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	But I'm here now.
		하지만 여기까지 왔으니
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	Do you wanna get a drink?
		한 잔 드릴까요?
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	- Sure.
		- Ok.
		- 물론요
		- 좋아요
00:17:58	 
		 
00:18:01	When did this happen?

		제복입은 여성을 좋아하지만
		이 모습이 더 맘에 드네요
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	You look-- you
		look smashing.

00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	Um,I was curious if there's been any more

		다른 정보가 없나 해서요
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	It was an overdose,jeremy.
		마약 과복용으로 인한 사망이네
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	Yeah,but her body was

		하지만 시체가 매장되어 있었죠
		누군가 그렇게 해놨을 거라구요
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:11	We're aware of that.
		우리도 잘 알고 있네
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	The investigation is ongoing,but there's
		nothing more I can tell you at this time.

		about vicki donovan's death.
		제레미가 비키 도노반의

00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	He knows that her death
		was ruled an overdose.
		마약 과용으로 인한
		죽음이라고 알고 있아요
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	Really?
		정말?

		주문을 걸수도 있지만
		마편초를 떼어내면
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	no.I don't want you to compel him.

00:22:06	Oh,I think it's like 1864 all
		over again,vampires running amok.
		다시 1864년이 된것 같군요
		미친듯 날뛰는 뱀파이어들이라
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	Guess we're just gonna

		그들을 뒤쫓아
00:22:13

00:22:15	That is the story,huh?
		옛날에 그렇게 뱀파이어를

00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	Part of the story,yeah.
		몰아내진 못했죠
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:20	Oh,there's,uh--
		there's more?
		그럼 아직.. 남아 있다구요?
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	Oh,there's a lot more.
		훨씬 많은 이야기가 남았죠
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	You see,seems there was a tomb under the
		church where the vampires were hidden away,
		알고 보니 교회 아래에
		뱀파이어들이 숨어있던 무덤이 있는데
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:29	waiting for someone to come

00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:32	But then you alrdy knew that,didn't you?
		하지만 당신은
		이미 알고 있었지?
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:36	Being that you're the one that did it.
		바로 그 봉인을 푼
		사람이 당신이니까
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:41	And you're telling me this why?
		이걸 이야기하는 이유가?
00:22:44

		제레미
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	I,um--i heard about your
		conversation with sheriff forbes.
		보안관님과 얘기 했다며
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:33	No one is trying figure
		out what happened to her.
		아무도 비키에게 무슨 일이
		생겼던건지 알아내려 하지 않아
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	THEY'RE ALL WILLING TO
		BELIEVE THAT SHE ODed.
		마약 과복용이라고
		믿으려고만 하지
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	The coroner's office confirmed it.
		검시관이 확인했다잖아
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	If that's what they
		said happened,then--
		진짜 그랬다면
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:40	is that what you believe?
		그렇게 믿는거야?
00:23:42	 
		 
00:23:42	What do you think happened?
		어떤 일이 생긴거 같은데?
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	I think somebody killed
		her and buried her body,
		누군가 죽여서
		묻어놓은 거 같아
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:46	and I don't think we should write
		it off just 'cause it's easy.
		그게 쉽다고 해서
		그렇게 단정지을 순 없어
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:49	They're just doing what
		they can to move on.
		접고 넘어가려고
		그러는 거야
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	The truth is the only thg
		that's gonna help people move on.
		하지만 진실만이 모두를
		극복하게 도와준다고
00:23:53	 
		 
00:23:53	Jer,just-- just
		let it go.ok?
		제레미, 그냥 잊어
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:55	Whatever it was,she's gone now.
		그게 뭐였든 간에
		이제 이 세상을 떠났잖아
00:23:58	 
		 
00:23:59	Whatever it was?
		그게 뭐였든지간에?
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:01	So you don't think it was an overdose.
		그럼 마약 과복용때문에
		죽은게 아니라 생각하구나
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:04	Yes.i--i
		do.
		아니, 그렇게 생각해
00:24:06	 
		 
00:24:07	Is there somethi you're not telling me?
		나한테 말 안하는거 있어?
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:10	Why aren't you looking at me?
		왜 날 못 쳐다봐?
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	Stop it.that doesn't mean anything.
		그만해
		아무 뜻 없어
00:24:13	 
		 
00:24:15	If there was something
		else,you would tell me,right?
		무슨 일이 있다면
		나한테 말 할거지?
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:19	Of course I would.
		물론이지
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:23	Oh,god.I ca-- I
		can't even walk.
		이런, 걸을 수도 없군
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	I know.me neither.
		나도요
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	Oh,god.matt's gonna kill me.
		맷이 가만 안둘텐데
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	Ah,he won't even notice.
		눈치 못챌걸요
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	I think he's actually letting
		himself have some fun for once.
		이번 한번은 스스로
		즐기는 거 같아요
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	Yeah,well--well,I know I'm supposed to
		be on my best behavior beuse of vicki,
		비키 일 때문에 행실을
		조심해야 했었는데
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	but i don't wanna think about it.
		그 생각은 하기 싫구나
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	e
		그럴 수 없어
		그러면...
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:46	yeah,I was a dick to her.
		전 비키한테 못되게 굴었어요
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	I was really bad.
		난 정말 나쁜 놈이었죠
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:51	That's what I hate is I
		can't make any of it right.
		바로잡을 수 없어서
		정말 안타까워요
00:24:56	 
		 
00:24:57	It's like I don't
		deserve to even miss h.
		그리워할 자격도
		없는 것 같죠
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:08	You're nice to talk to me.
		얘기 정말 즐거웠다
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:11	I don't have anyone to talk to.
		얘기할 사람이 없었거든
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:17	I don't have anyone to talk to either.
		나도 말할 사람이 없었어요
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:24	Who knew I'd be missing all the
		fun at the founder's parties?
		설립기념일 파티가
		즐거울 줄 누가 알았겠어?

00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:29	Is it bad that I'm,uh,enjoying myself?
		내가 즐기고 있다면
		안 좋은건가?

00:36:29

00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:35	oh,my god.you scared me.

00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	Sorry.
		미안
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:40	I'm sorry that i--
		I ran off earlier.
		미안해
		요전날 사라진거
00:37:42

00:37:44	Is everything ok?
		괜찮아?
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:50	No.
		아니
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	Talk to me.

00:37:54	 
		 
00:38:03	Stefan,tell me.
		얘기해보라고
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:06	So hard to keep it together tonight.
		참아보려고 노력했어
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	it was working,uh,but--but
		then matt's mom,she,h,got hurt,
		효과가 있었는데
		맷의 어머니가 다치셨어
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	and she was bleeding,and I
		had her--her blood on my hands.
		피를 흘리셨지 그런데
		내 손에 그분 피가 묻었어
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:22	And then what happened?
		그리고 어떻게 됐어?
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	And then that--that guy in the
		parking lot,I wantedo feed on him,
		그런데 그.. 주차장의 남자
		그 놈을 물어뜯고 싶었어
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:28	and it took everything
		inside of me not to do it.
		하지만 모든 에너지를 쏟아
		스스로를 말렸지
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:31	- But you didn't?
		- No,but I wanted to.
		- 그를 물지 않았잖아?
		- 그래, 하지만 원했어
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	god.
		 
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	Elena,i--my-- my head is pounding,I
		feel like my-- skin is on-- is on fire.
		머리가... 터질 것 같고
		살이.. 타는 느낌이야
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:44	I have this hunger inside of me that I've
		never-- I've never felt before in my entire life,
		평생 느껴보지 못했던 그런
		내면의 배고픔이 남아있어
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	and all I keep thinking about isow I promised
		that I would never keep anything from you,
		너한테 비밀은 없다고
		약속했던 게 계속 생각나서
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:54	and so I'm telling you this.
		지금 말해주는거야
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:55	That's ok.I need you
		to tell me these things.
		괜찮아. 다 얘기해주길 원해
00:38:57	 
		 
00:38:57	But I don't want you
		to see me like this.
		하지만 이런 모습을
		보지 않길 원해
00:38:59	 
		 
00:38:59	I don't want you to know
		that this side of me exists.
		나한테 이런 면이
		존재한다는 걸
00:39:02	 
		 
00:39:02	Stefan,you're gonna get through this.
		스테판, 넌 견뎌낼거야
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:04	I'm gonna help you pull through.
		내가 도와줄게
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:06	It's gonna be ok.you're gonna be ok.
		괜찮을거야
		괜찮을거라구
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	No,no,no,no.
		안되겠어
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:11	No,I'm sorry.-i can't.
		미안하지만
		안돼
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	I-i'm afraid of what I could do to you.
		너한테 어떤 짓을 할지 몰라서
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:21	I'm not.
		난 두렵지 않아
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:25	Stefan.Stefan,I'm not.
		스테판
		그럴 일 없을거라고
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:32	I'm not,ok?
		알았어?
00:39:35
