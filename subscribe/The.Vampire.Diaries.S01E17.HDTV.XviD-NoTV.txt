00:00:00	Previously on "the vampire diaries"...
		지난이야기.
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	For over a century, I have lived in secret
		한 세기를 걸쳐
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:03	 
		 
00:00:03	Until now. I know the risk,
		위험한건 알지만
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	but I have to know her.
		그녀를 알아야 한다
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	There's a tomb underneath the church.
		교회 아래에 무덤이 있어
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
		주문으로 캐더린을 봉인했어
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	I'm gonna bring her back.
		다시 살려낼거야
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	She's not there!
		캐더린은 거기 없었다구!
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	You saved everyone in the church?
		교회에 있던
		모두를 살려낸거야?
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	We've taken up residence in a farmhouse just outside of town.
		교외의 농가 주택에
		머물고 있다네
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	- All 25 vampires? - Some.
		- 25명 모두요?
		- 그 중 일부만
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	I hate this house. I didn't stay locked up for 145 years
		이 집 맘에 안들어
		난 여기 갇혀 있자고
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	to end up locked up here.
		무덤에 145년간
		갇혀있던게 아녔어
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	Aah!
		 
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	Ugh!
		 
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	So, where's Bethanne?
		베타니는 어디있지?
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	She won't be coming back.
		돌아오지 않을겁니다
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:30	My wife Isabelle spent her life
		제 아내 이자벨은 평생을
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	researching paranormal activity in this area.
		이 지역의 비과학적 현상들을
		연구하는데 바쳤죠
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	- What have you done to my wife? - I turned her.
		- 내 아내한테 뭘 한거야?
		- 뱀파이어로 만들어줬어
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	Maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
		뱀파이어란게 진짜
		존재할지 몰라
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	They're just different from the way we always thought they were.
		우리가 늘 생각했던것과
		다를 뿐이고 말야
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:40	Aah!
		 
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	You got a problem with blood, Anna?
		피를 무서워하니?
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	Ahh!
		 
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:43	I knew this girl Vicki.
		비키라는 애를 알았어
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck.
		동물의 공격을 받았어
		목을 물렸지
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	And then I saw your face.
		그리고 네 얼굴을 봤어
00:00:48	 
		 
00:00:48	Why would you confront me about it?
		왜 나한테 그걸 들이댄거야?
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	Because maybe it's true about Vicki.
		비키에 관한게
		사실일지 모르니까
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:51	And also because I want you to turn me.
		날 뱀파이어로 만들어주길 원해

		난 폭풍우가 좋더라
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:34	That a vampire thing?
		뱀파이어는 원래 그래?
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	'Cause I read vampires don't like raining water.
		내가 읽기론 뱀파이어는
		빗물을 좋아하지 않는다는데
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	It's only Dracula.
		드라큘라나 그렇지
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:39	Yeah. He was a complete wuss.
		그래. 완전 겁쟁이였어
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	Never showered. Very smelly.
		샤워도 잘 안하고
		정말 냄새가 심했어

00:01:52	You gotta tell me more. I gotta know.
		더 알려줘
		알아야 겠어
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	No, you don't.
		안돼
00:01:56	 
		 
00:01:56	'Cause you're not gonna be one.
		넌 뱀파이어가 되지 못할 거거든
00:01:58	 
		 
00:01:58	Come on, you can't keep saying "no" to me.
		자꾸 안된다고만 하지 마
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	Look, I'm not gonna turn someone
		난 영화에서 뱀파이어의 모든걸 배운

00:02:01	 
		난 영화에서 뱀파이어의 모든걸 배운

		난 영화에서 뱀파이어의 모든걸 배운
		사람을 뱀파이어로 만들고 싶지 않아
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:04	That's not true, and you know it.
		사실이 아냐
		너도 알잖아
00:02:06	 
		 
00:02:08	Why do you even want this?
		대체 왜 원하는 건데?
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	Give me one good reason.
		좋은 이유를 대봐
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	'Cause I...
		왜냐면
00:02:15	 
		 
00:02:17	Hmm. Let me know when you can finish that sentence.
		그 문장 언제쯤 끝낼지 알려줘
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:24	Hey, you're still up.
		아직도 깨있네
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:27	Hey, what's up?
		무슨 일이야?
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:28	Looks like the there's a big storm rolling in.
		폭풍우가 몰려오는 거 같은데
00:02:30	 
		 
00:02:30	Can you help make sure all the windows are closed?
		창문 다 닫았나
		확인 좀 해줄래?
00:02:32	 
		 
00:02:32	Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
		알았어
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:46	We're running low on blood.
		피가 모자라요
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	You might wanna send Anna to the hospital to get some more.
		애나한테 병원에서
		더 가져오라 시키시죠
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:51	I'll send her out for some tomorrow.
		내일 보낼거네
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:54	Maybe I could go with her.
		같이 가도 되구요
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:55	If the storm keeps it dark enough,
		폭풍우 때문에
		계속 컴컴하면
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	I might be able to go out during the day, no sun and all.
		나도 낮에 나갈 수 있을거에요
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	I'm afraid not.
		글쎄
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	Not after your stunt at the Salvatore's house tonight.
		어젯밤 살바토어 집에서
		벌인 행동을 보면 안되겠네
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	He and his brother deserved it.
		뿌리는 대로
		거두는 법이에요
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	And where did that get you?
		그래서 어떻게 됐지?
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead.
		네 여자친구
		베타니가 죽었지
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	And you have no one to blame but yourself.
		자넨 자네밖에
		탓할 사람이 없어
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	We cannot live our lives about revenge.
		우린 복수 때문에
		인생을 살아갈순 없어
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:14	We have to have better control of our emotions.
		우리 감정을 다스릴줄 아는
		방법을 배워야 하지
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	I understand, Miss Pearl.
		나도 이해해요, 펄 양
00:03:19	 
		 
00:03:19	I just wish I knew what you were up to.
		당신의 본심이 뭔지
		알수 있으면 좋을텐데
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:27	I'm going to make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow
		난 내일 마을 탐색을 나설거네
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	to assess who's under the influence of vervain and who isn't.
		어떤 사람들이 마편초를 먹었는지
		안먹었는지 확인할거야
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:33	Anna tells me that the players haven't changed much.
		애나가 그러길
		그다지 변하지 않았다더군
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	It's still the Lockwoods, the Forbes, the Fell...
		아직 록우드가와
		포브스가, 펠가 가족들이 살지
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	We should kill every last one of them.
		그 놈들을 남김없이
		죽여야 해요
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	We are smarter than that, Frederick.
		우린 그것보단 영리하다구, 프레드릭
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:43	These people are not our enemies.
		그들은 우리 적이 아냐
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:46	We don't hold grudges and resentments.
		그들에겐 원한이나 분노를
		갖고 있지 않다구
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:48	We'll get our town back.
		우린 우리 마을을
		되찾을 거네
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:50	We just have to have patience.
		그저 참고 기다려야 해
00:03:54	 
		 
00:04:05	You heard her.
		들었지
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	No revenge.
		복수는 없다
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	Patience.
		참아라
00:04:11	 
		 
00:04:12	Self-control.
		자제해라
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:17	She seems to have it all figured out, doesn't she?
		다 눈치챈거 같은데?

		Let The Right One In
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:32	I say we go to Pearl's, bust down the door,
		펄 집에 가서
		문을 부수고
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night.
		어젯밤 우리를 공격한
		그 얼간이를 제압하는거야
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:36	Yeah. And then what? We turn to the rest of that house of vampires
		그래? 그리고 그 집의
		나머지 뱀파이어들에게
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	and say, "Oops. Sorry?"
		'저런. 미안해요'라고 하게?
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	I can't believe you made a deal with her.
		그녀와 거래를 했다니
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:42	It was more like a helpful exchange of information.
		그것보단 유용한 정보 교환이었지
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	And it was not exactly like I had a choice. She's...
		달리 방법이 없었다구
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	scary.
		무서운 여자였으니
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back.
		캐더린을 되찾게
		해준다고 했으니까
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:53	Of course she is.
		물론이겠지
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:55	Damon gets what he wants, as usual.
		늘 그렇듯 데이먼은
		원하는 걸 갖는다
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	No matter who he hurts in the process.
		그 과정에서
		누가 다치든 상관없이
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:58	You don't have to be snarky about it.
		짜증낼 필요는 없잖아
00:04:59	 
		 
00:05:00	I woke up this morning
		아침에 일어났는데
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb.
		무덤에 있던 모든 뱀파이어가
		살아 돌아왔단걸 알게 됐어요
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	I've earned snarky.
		짜증날 만도 하죠
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	How long are you going to blame me
		언제까지 날 탓할거야?
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	for turning your birth mother into a vampire?
		네 친모를 뱀파이어로
		만든 거 가지구?
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	I'm not blaming you, Damon.
		당신 탓 안해요, 데이먼
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	I've accepted the fact that you're a self-serving psychopath
		당신이 자기밖에 모르는
		사이코패스에다
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	with no redeeming qualities.
		발전의 기미가 없단걸
		받아들이기로 한거죠
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:16	Ouch.
		이런
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	This isn't being very productive.
		별로 생산적인
		대화는 아니네
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	We're figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah?
		펄과 뱀파이어를 대면할 방법은
		나중에 생각하자고
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	Hmm.
		 
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:26	I'm sorry. He just makes me so cranky.
		미안. 데이먼이
		날 짜증나게 해서
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	I know. He makes everybody cranky.
		데이먼은 모두를
		짜증나게 만드는걸
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	So, what are we going to do?
		어쩔거야?
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:32	Damon and I are gonna handle everything, I promise.
		데이먼하고 내가
		다 해결 할거야
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	Well, what about me?
		난?
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	I can't just sit here and do nothing.
		그냥 앉아서
		아무것도 안할순 없다구
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:38	That's exactly what you're gonna do,
		바로 그렇게 하는거야
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	because that's what going to keep you safe.
		그래야 안전할테니
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	Which means nothing if you're not safe, too.
		너도 안전하지 않으면
		아무 의미 없지
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	What do you mean? I'm perfectly safe.
		무슨 말이야?
		난 완벽히 안전한데
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	I have Damon, the self-serving psychopath on my side.
		내 옆에 자기밖에 모르는
		사이코패스 데이먼이 있는걸
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	Well that's comforting.
		안심이 되네
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:56	Ok. We have some time.
		시간이 좀 있어
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:59	I'm not meeting my mom until later.
		좀 있다 엄마
		만나기로 했거든
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	Wait. Doess your mom know you're a...
		잠깐. 너희 엄마도 네가..
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	The fact that you would even think it's possible
		지금 방금 네가
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	to keep something like that a secret from your own family
		가족한테 이런 비밀을
		숨길거라 생각한건
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	is just further proof that you're not ready.
		준비가 안됐다는 또다른 증거야
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	"Not ready" is a step up from "no".
		준비가 안됐다니
		아예 안된단 것보단 발전했네
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	And a million steps down from "maybe".
		'어쩌면'보다는 훨씬 아래고
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:15	I like your bracelet.
		네 팔찌 맘에 든다
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	Thanks. My sister got it for me.
		고마워
		누나가 줬어
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:19	Can I see it?
		봐도 돼?
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	Yeah. Yeah.
		그래
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:26	Your sister doesn't know you're hanging out with me, does she?
		네 누나는 나랑
		어울리는거 모르지?
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	No. No. But I don't see why it would be a problem.
		응. 하지만
		그게 문제될 이유 없는데
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	It's not like she knows what you are.
		네 정체를 아는것도 아니니까
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	I'd rather keep it our little secret.
		그냥 우리만의
		작은 비밀로 하고 싶어
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:38	You know, why don't you... why don't you keep this?
		그냥.. 네가..
		갖고 있는게 어때?
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	Why would you give this to me?
		왜 나한테 주는거야?
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:45	Because. You like it. And I like you.
		네가 그 팔찌를 좋아하고
		나도 널 좋아하니까
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	You only like me because of what you want from me.
		네가 원하는 거 때문에
		날 좋아하는 거면서
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	No. I... I like you.
		아니야
		널.. 좋아해
00:06:55	 
		 
00:07:00	Um...
		 
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	You know, you should wear it.
		네가 차고 다녀
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	It looks better on you.
		너한테 더 잘 어울리니까
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:10	I yelled at my mom last night.
		어젯밤에 엄마한테
		소리를 질렀어
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:12	You know, I feel like the parent and the screwed-up kid.
		난 부모가 된 느낌이라니까
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	Maybe she needed to hear it.
		그런 소리를
		들으셨어야 했을지도
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	Yeah, but just... I worry that if I push too hard,
		알아, 하지만
		내가 너무 압박하면
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	Then she will take off again.
		다시 떠나실지 몰라
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	'Cause that's her M.O.
		엄마 수법이거든
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	Just like Vicki, who I haven't heard from since she left.
		비키처럼
		떠난후 소식이 없었지
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	Well, you can't control your mom, Matt,
		네 엄마를 네가 통제할 순 없어
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:28	any more than you can control your sister.
		네 동생을
		통제 못했듯이
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	I wish that she would just try a little. You know?
		그냥 조금 노력해주셨음 좋겠어
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	If she would just try to try, that'd be ok.
		그냥 노력하는 모습을
		보여주면 좋을거야
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	Maybe she'll surprise you.
		널 놀래키실지도
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	People have a tendency to do that.
		사람들은 그런
		경향이 있거든
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:42	I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm.
		폭풍우가 더 심해지기 전에
		빨리 떠나야겠다
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	Yeah. Are you sure you should be driving right now?
		그래. 너 근데
		지금 운전해도 되겠어?
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	I have to. It's my dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday.
		가야해. 아빠 남자친구의
		딸 생일이거든
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	We have a non-traditional traditional ritual.
		전통적이지 않은
		전통 의식이 있어
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	Well, buckle up. Don't speed.
		조심히 운전해
		천천히
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Stay off your cell phone.
		휴대폰은 가까이 하지 말고
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	And call me when you get there.
		도착하면 전화줘
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	Got it. Anything else?
		알았어
		또 있어?
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	Yes.
		응
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:10	Bye.
		안녕
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	Bye.
		안녕
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:19	Hunting party?
		사냥 파티하게?
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	That guy did a number on me last night when he stabbed me.
		그 남자가 어젯밤
		날 찔렀을때 꽤 상처를 입었어
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	I gotta get my strength back up.
		힘을 되찾으러 가야해
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	I've got 2 liters of soccer mom in the fridge.
		냉장고에 30대 주부
		피가 2리터 있어
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:27	No?
		싫니?
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:30	We'll talk when I get back?
		돌아오면 얘기하자
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	All right. Give my regards to the squirrels.
		좋아. 다람쥐들한테
		내 안부 전해줘
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:52	Aah!
		 
00:08:53	 
		 
00:09:11	You're ignoring me.
		날 무시하는군
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	The 6 missed calls? Sorry. My phone is dead.
		부재중 전화 6통이라
		죄송. 제 휴대폰이 꺼져있어서
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	- Is Stefan here? - No.
		- 스테판 있니?
		- 없어요
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	Why?
		왜?
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	Something wrong?
		뭐 잘못 됐나요?
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	He went out to the woods and didn't come back.
		숲속에 갔는데
		돌아오질 않아
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	I can't get him on his phone.
		전화도 안받고
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:23	I figure he was here with you.
		너랑 같이 있을줄 알았는데
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	It's going straight to voicemail.
		바로 음성메일로 넘어가네
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	Where could he be?
		어디 있을까요?
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	You're not going to like what I'm thinking.
		내 생각을
		좋아하지 않을거야
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:35	Pearl! Open this door.
		펄! 문 열어요!
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	I swear to god I'll bust through and rip your head off.
		문 부수고
		머리를 뜯는 수가 있으니
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:41	Pearl's not home.
		펄은 집에 없소
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:45	Hmm. Beautiful weather.
		날씨 참 좋네
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:48	Not a ray of sun in the sky.
		하늘에 햇빛 한줄기도
		보이지 않으니
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	Where's my brother?
		내 동생 어딨지?
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:52	Billy.
		빌리
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:58	- You're dead. - Whoa. I'm sorry.
		- 죽은줄 알아
		- 미안
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	You haven't been invited in.
		초대를 안 받았군
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	Miss Gibbons?
		기본스양?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	Yes, Frederick honey?
		네, 프레드릭?
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	Never let this bad man in.
		이 나쁜 남자는
		절대 들이지 마
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	I'll never let him in.
		절대 들이지 않겠습니다
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:14	Ugh!
		 
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	145 years left starving in a tomb,
		145년간 무덤속에
		굶주렸어
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	thanks to Katherine's infatuation with you and your brother.
		너와 네 동생에 빠진
		캐더린 덕분에
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	First few weeks,
		처음 몇 주 동안은
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	every single nerve in your body screams with fire.
		온몸의 모든 신경이
		불과 함께 절규해
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	The kind of pain that can drive a person mad.
		사람을 미치게 만들때의
		고통처럼 말이지
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	Well...
		그래서..
00:10:31	 
		 
00:10:31	I thought your brother might've wanted to get a taste of that
		네 동생도 그 맛을
		한번 보고 싶어할거 같았어
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:33	before I killed him. Billy.
		죽이기 전에 말야
		빌리
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:36	Uhh!
		 
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:39	Aah!
		 
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	You have a nice day.
		즐거운 하루 되게
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:53	What happened? Where is he?
		무슨 일이죠?
		스테판은 어디 있어요?
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	They have him. I can't get in.
		그들한테 잡혀있어
		들어갈 수가 없어
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	Why not?
		왜죠?
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:58	Because the woman that owns the house
		그 집 주인 여자가
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	is compelled to not let me in.
		날 들이지 말라는
		주문에 걸렸거든
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	I can get in.
		난 들어갈 수 있어요
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	You're not going in there.
		들어가면 안돼
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	- I'm going! - You're not going there.
		- 갈거에요!
		- 안에 못 가
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:05	Why are they doing this? What do they want with him?
		왜 그러는 거죠?
		뭘 원한대요?
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	Revenge. They want revenge.
		복수
		복수를 원하는거야
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	We gotta do something.
		우리도 뭔가 해야되요
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	I know.
		알아
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	We can't let them hurt him. We gotta get him out of there.
		스테판을 다치게 둘수 없어요
		구해 와야 한다구요
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	I know. Elena, I know.
		알아, 엘레나
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	But I don't know how to get him out.
		꺼내올 방법을 모를 뿐이야
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:39	Vervain on the ropes.
		마편초를 뿌린 밧줄
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:44	Aah! Unh!
		 
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	That's gotta sting.
		따끔하겠어
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:50	Speaking of...
		그 말이 나와서..
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:58	Aah!
		 
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:00	This isn't right!
		이건 옳지 않습니다!
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:03	He killed Bethanne.
		베타니를 죽였어
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	One of us, Harper.
		우리 가족을 말야, 하퍼
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	And don't think for a second he wouldn't kill you if he had the chance.
		기회가 있으면
		너도 죽일게 뻔해
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right?
		펄이 그러길
		복수가 목표가 아니랬지
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:17	I say that's exactly what we're here for.
		내 생각에 우린
		바로 복수를 위해 있는거야
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:24	Starting with this.
		이것부터 시작하지
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	Aah! Aah!
		 
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:29	And then his brother.
		또 그의 형
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	And anyone else that gets in our way.
		우리를 방해하는
		누구든지
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	This isn't right!
		이건 옳지 않아요!
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	You're gonna wanna let go of me!
		날 놔주고 싶을텐데
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	Miss Pearl will be home soon.
		펄 양이 곧
		집에 올겁니다
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	Miss Pearl is no longer in charge.
		펄 양은 더이상
		책임자가 아냐
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:42	Tie him up! And then stake him.
		묶어두게
		나중에 말뚝으로 찌르고
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:56	Well, don't you look... alive?
		참.. 생생하게
		살아 계시군요
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	You can't hurt me.
		날 해하진 못해
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	Oh, I can hurt you, all right.
		해할수는 있어요
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:05	Mr. Saltzman.
		살츠만 선생님
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:09	We need your help.
		도움이 필요해요
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Stefan's in the house.
		스테판이 그 집에 있어요
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	Damon's a vampire. He can't get in. We need you.
		데이먼은 뱀파이어라
		들어갈수 없구요. 당신이 필요해요
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	I would go, but...
		가고 싶지만...
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:17	Your life is valuable.
		쟤 목숨은 귀하죠
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	Yours, on the other hand...
		하지만 당신은...
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	Stefan told me about your ring.
		스테판이 당신의
		반지에 대해 말해줬어요
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	What about it?
		그게 뭐?
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	Let me recap...
		지난 회를 간추려보죠
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	You tried to kill me. I defended myself.
		날 죽이려고 했는데
		내가 막았고
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	You died.
		당신이 죽였죠
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	And according to my brother,
		내 동생에 의하면
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	your ring brought you back to life.
		당신 반지가
		당신을 되살렸죠
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	Am I leaving anything out?
		뭐 빠뜨린거 있나요?
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:33	Yeah. The part where I try and kill you again.
		그래. 내가 당신을
		또다시 죽이려고 했던거
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	Only this time, I don't miss.
		이번에는
		실수 안할거지
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Mr. Saltzman. Please.
		살츠만 선생님
		제발요
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	It's Stefan.
		스테판 일이에요
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:41	I'm sorry, Elena. But it's not my problem.
		미안하네, 엘레나
		그건 내 문제가 아냐
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	That's a shame.
		참 안타깝네요
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	Because the woman in charge of the crowd
		뱀파이어 무리를
		지휘하는 여성이
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	can help you find your wife.
		당신 아내 찾는걸
		도와줄수 있을텐데
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:49	- You're lying. - Am I?
		- 거짓말
		- 내가요?
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	Why don't you ask her yourself?
		그 여자한테
		직접 물어보지 그래요?
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:55	Coward.
		겁쟁이
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	Come on, Elena.
		가자, 엘레나
00:13:58	 
		 
00:14:03	All right! Wait. I'll go.
		좋아! 잠깐만
		나도 같이 가죠
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:10	So, I have an answer.
		답변해줄게
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	To what?
		뭘?
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:13	Why you should turn me.
		날 왜 뱀파이어로
		만들어줘야 하는지
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	We're back to that?
		그 얘기로 다시 돌아가게?
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	Look, I wake up every day, and I feel ok,
		매일 아침에 일어나면
		기분은 괜찮아
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	but there's something missing.
		하지만 뭔가 허전한 느낌이야
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	Like a... like a hole.
		구멍이 난 것 처럼
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	Some people, they fit... in life, or whatever.
		다들 뭔가
		삶의 의미가 있지만
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	I... I don't.
		난.. 아냐
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	So, you want a pity-turn?
		동정심 때문에
		바꿔달라고?
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	I don't think so.
		글쎄
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:35	You should turn me because I don'have anything else.
		나한텐 아무것도 없으니까
		날 바꿔줘야 해
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:44	Do you even know why we turn other people?
		우리가 왜 다른 사람들을
		바꿔주는지 알아?
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	It's not to give someone a one-way ticket out of loner-hood. Ok?
		외로움을 벗어날 기회를
		제공해주는게 아냐
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	One... we need someone to do our dirty work.
		첫째, 우리의 더러운 일을
		처리해줄 사람이 필요해서
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:53	Two, revenge.
		둘째, 복수로
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	Three, boredom... but, you know, that never turns out well.
		세번째는 지루함 때문이지만
		절대 좋게 끝나질 않지
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	And then there's the obvious one.
		그리고 명백한
		한가지가 남았어
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:03	You love someone so much that you would do anything
		누군가 너무 사랑해서
		어떻게든
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	to spend all of eternity with them.
		평생을 함께 하려고
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:12	Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit any of those categories yet.
		미안해, 하지만 넌
		아무 목록에 속하질 않네
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:20	So, yeah. Just make sure your thesis is clear,
		네 논리가 확실해지면
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	and she'll love it.
		선생님이
		맘에 들어 하실거야
00:15:25	See you later.
		 
		나중에 봐
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:29	
		'엄마야'
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:32	- Mom, hey. - Did you get everything?
		- 엄마
		- 뭐 얻어낸거 있니?
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:34	The blood-bank was understaffed because of the rain.
		혈액은행은 비 때문에
		손이 모자라요
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	I was in and out.
		갔다 나왔어요
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	Who's that you were talking to?
		아까 누구랑 얘기했니?
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	A friend from the library.
		도서관에서 사귄 친구요
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	Let's get home.
		집에 가자꾸나
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:44	Hey, you're not going out in that, are you?
		설마 지금 나가시려고요?
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	The roads are dangerous. Route 5 is completely flooded.
		길이 위험해요
		5번 도로가 물에 잠겼습니다
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:50	We'll make do.
		그럼 다른 길로 가죠
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:52	Mayor lockwood, we have your table ready.
		락우드 시장님
		테이블 준비 됐습니다
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	Great.
		좋아요
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	Mayor... Lockwood, is it?
		락우드.. 시장님인가요?
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:58	I suppose it is treacherous outside.
		밖이 정말
		위험할 거 같네요
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	My name is Pearl.
		전 펄이라고 합니다
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	Hi.
		안녕하세요
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	This is my daughter Anna.
		제 딸 애나구요
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	We've just recently moved to town.
		최근에 이 동네로 이사 왔어요
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	Welcome. Richa lockwood. This is my son Tyler.
		환영합니다. 리차드 락우드입니다
		제 아들 타일러구요
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	Please... please, join us.
		저희와 합석하시죠
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:15	It would be a pleasure.
		그럼 영광이구요
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:20	Be more creepy, Dad.
		소름끼치네요
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	Not like your son is standing right here.
		바로 앞에 아들이 서있는데
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	Grow up. Elections are coming.
		철 좀 들어라
		선거가 다가오는걸
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	She's a constituent. And a rich one, from the looks of it.
		저분은 유권자야
		겉모습을 봐선 부자가 확실하고
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	You can tell all that by looking at her ass?
		엉덩이 보는 걸로
		그걸 다 알아요?
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	Awesome. I'm gonna go shoot some pool.
		대단하네요
		난 수영장을 가봐야겠네
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:39	Teacher by day, vampire hunter by night.
		낮에는 선생님
		밤에는 뱀파이어 헌터
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	I've you to thank for that. What are these?
		- 당신 덕이지
		- 이건 뭐죠?
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	Those are tranquilizer darts filled with vervain.
		마편초가 들어있는
		다트 주사야
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	Just get me in. I'll get Stefan out.
		날 들어가게 만들어주면
		내가 스테판을 꺼내올게요
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	That's your plan? You're just gonna take them all on yourself?
		당신 계획이 그거에요?
		그냥 혼자 처리하겠다?
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	Well, I'll be a little stealthier than that, hopefully.
		살금살금 가야지
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	Whoa. What are you doing?
		뭐 하는 거니?
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	I'm going with you.
		나도 같이 갈래요
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	No. No. No. No. No way.
		말도 안돼
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	You need me. I'll get in.
		내가 필요해요
		들어갈거라구요
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	You could distract them, and then I'll get Stefan out.
		당신이 주의를 돌리면
		제가 스테판을 꺼내올게요
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	You'll get yourself killed. You're not going in there.
		죽을 수도 있어
		들어가면 안돼
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:07	I'm going.
		갈거에요
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	So, when you get me in, get out as quickly as you can.
		날 그 집에 들이면
		최대한 빨리 나와요
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:11	I know how to sneak around where they can't hear me.
		그들이 들을 수 없는 곳에서
		몰래 움직이는 법을 아니까
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	You'll basically just be in the way.
		당신은 말그대로
		방해가 되는거죠
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	Damon, now is not the time to be the lone ranger.
		데이먼, 지금은
		혼자 싸울 때가 아녜요
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	Fine. Elena, you can drive the get away car.
		좋아. 엘레나
		차 운전해도 돼
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	You're not going in the house.
		집에는 못 들어가
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	You can't stop me. It's Stefan we're talking about here.
		난 막을수 없어요
		스테판 일이라구요
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:25	You don't understand.
		이해를 못하는군
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	Oh, I understand. I understand.
		아주 잘 이해해
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:29	He's the reason you live.
		네가 사는 이유지
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	His love lifts you up where you belong. I get it.
		그의 사랑이 널
		드높여주고. 이해해
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	Can you not joke around for 2 seconds?
		2초간만 농담 안할수 없어요?
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	I can't protect you, Elena.
		난 널 지켜줄수 없어
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	I don't know how many vampires there are in there,
		거기 뱀파이어가
		몇이나 있는지 몰라
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	that's how long it takes you to get your head ripped off.
		쉽게 네 목을 뜯길 수도 있다고
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	I have to be able to get in and get out.
		난 들어갔다 나올수
		있기만 하면 돼
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	I can't be distracted with your safety.
		네 안전을 확인하느라
		정신 산란해 질거라구
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	Or this will end up a blood bath that none of us walk away from...
		아니면 아무도 나오지 못하는
		피의 숙청으로 끝날수도 있으니
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	Including Stefan.
		스테판을 포함해서 말야
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:56	I know.
		알아
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	I get it.
		이해해
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	I understand.
		이해한다고
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:05	If we're gonna go, let's go.
		갈거면 어서 갑시다
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:17	Where are you? I can barely hear you.
		어디있어?
		잘 안 들린다
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	I was supposed to go to my dad's, but route 5 closed down.
		아빠네 가야 하는데
		5번 도로가 막혔어
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	Now I'm detoured on some random backwoods path to hell.
		지옥으로 향하는 숲속 길로
		우회해 가는 길이야
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	Well, you shouldn't be talking while you're driving.
		운전할때 전화하면 안돼
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	I know, right?
		알아
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	I need one of those bluetooth thingies.
		블루투스인가
		뭔가가 필요한데
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	Look, you're breaking up.
		전화가 뚝뚝 끊긴다
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	Just turn around and go back the same way you came.
		다시 돌아서
		왔던길로 돌아가
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	And watch the road. Ok?
		길도 잘 보고. 알았지?
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	Ok.
		알았어
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:45	God.
		세상에
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:52	Ohh.
		 
00:18:54	 
		 
00:19:01	Seriously?
		진짜
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:13	Oh, good, someone's home.
		집에 누가 왔나보네
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Uh, could I use your phone?
		전화 좀 쓸 수 있을까요?
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	My... my car broke down a few miles off the road.
		차가 고장이 나서요
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	This was the first house I saw.
		거기서 걸어오다가
		처음으로 발견한 집이라
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	Well, lucky you.
		운도 좋으시네요
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	Yeah. Lucky me.
		그렇죠. 다행이죠
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	It's no trouble, is it?
		그럼 좀 들어가도?
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	Not the slightest.
		들어오세요
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	Great. Whew.
		좋아요
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:31	Hey, man, I really appreciate it.
		정말 감사합니다
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	It's rough out there.
		밖이 정말 험해서
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:35	Billy, show our visitor where the phone is in the kitchen.
		빌리, 이분한테
		전화기 어디있는지 보여드려
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	And get me something to drink.
		마실 것도 가져다 드리고
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:40	Yeah. Sure thing.
		물론 하죠
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:47	Hey, Miss Gibbons, this guy wants to use your phone.
		기븐스씨
		이분이 전화기를 쓰고 싶다는데
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	Oh, sure, honey. It's right there.
		바로 저기 있어요
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	Thanks.
		고마워요
00:19:56	 
		 
00:20:00	Aah!
		 
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:04	What's happening?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	I'm really sorry. But you're gonna need to invite
		정말 미안하지만
		제 친구 좀
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	a friend of mine inside.
		들어오게 해주셔야 겠어요
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	Oh, I'm sorry. He's not allowed in the house.
		미안해요. 저 분은
		집에 들어올수 없어요
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	I know that. But you gotta make an exception.
		알아요. 하지만
		예외는 있잖아요
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	Get her out of the house. Now!
		당장 집 밖으로 내보네요!
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth.
		기븐스양
		사실을 말해줘요
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	- Are you married? - No.
		- 결혼했어요?
		- 아뇨
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:19	Parents, children, anyone else who lives on this property?
		부모,자식이나 이 집에
		달리 사는 사람 있나요?
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	No. It's just me.
		아뇨. 나 혼자 살아요
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	Good.
		잘됐네
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:26	You were supposed to compel her.
		주문을 걸어야지
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	- It doesn't work that... - She was human.
		- 그건 안통해요...
		- 인간이었다구
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	And I'm not! So, I don't care.
		난 인간 아니라
		상관 안해요
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	Now, get out of here. Get rid of the body!
		이젠 여기서 나가요
		시체는 치우고!
00:20:34	 
		 
00:21:04	I'm in the process of obtaining some property.
		소유지를 구입하는
		절차를 진행중이죠
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:07	I understand that your family is the largest property in town.
		시장님 가족은
		부동산 재벌이라던데요
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	Well, yes we are.
		네, 그렇죠
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	Dating all the way back to the town's original charter.
		마을의 최초 설립 때로
		거슬러 올라가죠
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	Your family came into a lot of new property in 1864.
		1864년에 락우드가에서
		새 소유지를 사들이셨죠
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	You know your history.
		마을 역사를 잘 아시는군요
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	It's a passion of mine.
		관심이 많거든요
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:24	Guy's not even subtle about it.
		대놓고 저러네
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:26	Who is that?
		누군데?
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	It's not my mother.
		엄마는 아냐
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:46	
		'거리를 유지해
		우린 비밀인거 기억안나?'
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:52	
		'지겨워'
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:59	
		'불평은 그만해'
00:21:59	 
		 
00:22:02	
		'뱀파이어 만들어주면
		불평 그만할게'
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:08	I'm sorry, Mayor.
		죄송합니다만
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	Do you know that boy over there?
		저쪽에 있는
		소년을 아시나요?
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	That's Jeremy Gilbert.
		제레미 길버트에요
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:14	You don't say.
		그렇군요
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:22	Billy, what's the hold up?!
		 
00:22:22	Billy, what's the hold up?!
		빌리, 무슨 일이지?
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:39	Aah!
		 
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:51	Damn it, Elena!
		젠장, 엘레나!
00:22:53	 
		 
00:23:04	Billy, Jacob, get back in here!
		빌리, 제이콥
		제자리로 돌아가!
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:55	Are you insane?
		정신 나갔어?
00:23:56	 
		 
00:25:21	Jeremy Gilbert?
		제레미 길버트라고?
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	Is that what you've been up to?
		네가 요즘
		몰래 만나던 애니?
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:25	He's my friend. What's the big deal?
		내 친구에요
		그게 뭐 대수라고
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	His family is the reason I was stuck in a tomb for over a century.
		그의 가족 때문에
		내가 백년넘게 무덤에 갇혀있었어
00:25:32	 
		 
00:25:32	That doesn't mean he'll make the same choices.
		그렇다고 그가 똑같은 선택을
		하리란 법은 없잖아요
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:34	I want you to stop seeing him.
		그만 만나렴
00:25:36	 
		 
00:25:36	I've been on my own for a long time, Mother.
		난 오랫동안 혼자였어요, 엄마
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	I can make my own decisions.
		내 결정은
		내가 한다구요
00:25:40	 
		 
00:25:40	Then stop acting like a child!
		그럼 애같은 짓 그만해!
00:25:42	 
		 
00:25:43	As soon as Jeremy finds out what you really are, he will turn on...
		제레미가 네 정체를 알면
		네게 등을..
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	He already knows.
		이미 알아요
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:48	What did you just say?
		방금 뭐라고 했니?
00:25:50	 
		 
00:25:50	Jeremy knows.
		제레미도 안다구요
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	He likes it. And he likes me.
		그래서 좋아해요
		나를 좋아하구요
00:25:54	 
		 
00:26:11	
		'뱀파이어 만들어줄게'
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:14	Unh.
		 
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	Uhh!
		 
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:19	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	For trying to help me.
		날 도와주려 했던거
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	They just needed somebody to blame.
		그들은 탓할 사람이
		필요했던 것 뿐예요
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	Someone to punish.
		벌 줄 사람이
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:30	Elena...
		엘레나
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	You shouldn't be here...
		넌 여기 있으면 안돼
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	She was supposed to stay in the car.
		차 안에 있으라고 했었지
00:26:38	 
		 
00:26:38	- Unh! - No. No. No. Not him.
		아니, 걔는 안돼
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	Whatever. Let's get you down.
		아무렴. 널 풀어주마
00:26:43	 
		 
00:26:43	Aah!
		 
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	There's vervain on the ropes.
		밧줄에 마편초가 묻어있어
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	Elena, pull that.
		엘레나, 당겨봐
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:50	Unh!
		 
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	All right, let's go. Clothes on.
		어서 가자
		옷 입고
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:53	- Wait. - What? Guys, come on.
		- 잠깐만
		- 빨리 서둘러
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	We have to get out of here.
		여길 나가야 해
00:26:57	 
		 
00:26:58	- Uhh! - Come on, we gotta go.
		어서, 빨리 가야 된다니까
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:00	The other one.
		다른 쪽도
00:27:02	 
		 
00:27:02	Uhh!
		 
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	Oh, my god.
		세상에
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	Can you get him in the car?
		차까지 데려갈 수 있지?

00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	What about you?

00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:11	You rescue, I'll distract. Go.
		네가 구조하는 동안
		난 주위를 돌릴게
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:18	Turn that down.
		소리 좀 낮춰봐
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:27	It's too quiet.

00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:34	Spread out. Now.

00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	Aah!
		 
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:42	And this is for the tomb.
		이건 무덤에 갇히게 만든 댓가고
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:44	- No - Ugh! Unh!
		안돼
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:53	Stefan...

00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:55	How many of those vervain darts do you have left?
		마편초 주사
		몇개나 남았죠?
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	One.
		한 개요
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:02	Not gonna be enough.

00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:11	What's it look like?
		뭐처럼 보여?
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	Honestly, I wouldn't know. I've never seen it before.
		사실 모르겠어요
		처음 보는 모습이라
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	Well, sit down. You might wanna order pizza.
		앉으렴
		피자 주문하고 싶어질걸
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	I'm out of practice.
		서투른 요리솜씨라
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:20	Mmm. Mystery casserole. Yum.
		미스테리한 캐서롤이네요
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:23	Yeah. Some people aren't meant for the kitchen.
		부엌일이 안 맞는
		사람도 있지
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:30	What?
		왜요?
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:31	Uh, I know it's been rough.
		힘들었던거 안다
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:34	But I'm gonna try. I mean, really try this time.
		나도 노력을 할거야
		이번엔 정말로
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	You just have to bear with me, ok?
		참고 지켜봐주렴
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Ok.

		그렇게 맛없니?
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:51	What happened to you?
		무슨 일이야?
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:55	Hey, Matt.

00:32:05	All right, give me 10 minutes.
		10분만 주십시요
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	And keep it out of the news until I get there.
		내가 도착하기 전까지
		언론에는 발표하지 마시오
00:32:08	 
		 
00:32:09	Grab your stuff. We gotta go.
		짐 챙겨

00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	Are you serious? Where was she?
		진짜에요?
		어디 있었대요?
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:17	Storm unearthed the grave off county road.
		폭풍우 덕에 산길에서
		발굴 되었대
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:19	They just brought her body down to the morgue.
		시체 보관소로
		갔다고 하는구나
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	Wait. She's dead?
		잠깐만요
		죽었다는 건가요?
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:25	Come on, we gotta go.

00:33:10	I trust you.
		널 믿어
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:43	So, what you said to get me to do this, about my wife.
		이 일을 돕게 하려고
		내 아내에 대해 했던 말
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	It was a lie, wasn't it?
		거짓말이었지?
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	Yep.
		네
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	Stop！

00:34:05	What did you do?
		뭘 한거야?
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	Me?
		나요?
00:34:07

		뱀파이어 무리들이
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:10	spent the day torturing my brother.
		내 동생을
		하루종일 고문했어요
00:34:12

		날 믿어. 그놈들은
		내가 처리 할거야
00:34:17	 
		 
00:34:17	Our little arrangement doesn't work unless you learn to control them.
		당신이 자제하는 법을 안 가르키면
		우리의 협정은 통하지 않는다구요
00:34:20	 
		 
00:34:20	This wasn't supposed to happen.
		이런 일이
		일어나선 안되는 거였는데
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	Well, it did.
		일어났는걸요
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:23	If I had a good side...
		나한테 착한 면이 있었다면
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	not a way to get on it.
		이런 방법은
		시도하지 않았을걸요
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:47	Argh!
		 
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	Ahh!

00:35:50	How are you doing?
		좀 어때?
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	I'm ok.
		괜찮아
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	The wounds have mostly healed.
		상처가 거의 아물었어
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	Good.
		잘됐다
00:35:59	 
		 
00:36:02	Elena...

		내가 했던거
		미안해...
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:22	I'm sorry that you had to see it.
		네가 봐야 했던거
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	I've just never...

00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	you were like this other person.

00:36:32	And it's my fault. I made you...
		내 잘못이야
		내가 널..
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	No. No. No. No.
		아니
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	You didn't make me do anything. You were saving my life.
		넌 아무것도 시키지 않았어
		네가 날 구해줬지
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:41	And I was saving yours.
		나도 널 구해줬고
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:50	Everything's gonna be ok.
		다 괜찮아질거야
00:36:52	 
		 
00:37:04	Hey, Jer...
		제레미
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:07	Well... what's going on?
		무슨.. 일이야?
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:12	Oh, no.
		이럴수가
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:48	I made you some coffee.
		커피 좀 끓여왔어
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	Thanks.
		고마워
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:52	Are you...
		너..
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	Is there anything I can do?
		내가 도울 방법 없니?
00:37:57	 
		 
00:38:05	I just, uh...
		난...
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:07	I need be alone right now.
		지금은 혼자있고 싶어
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:29	Ma...
		 
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:50	That was fun. 
		아까는 재미있었어요
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:53	Oh, don't look at me like that.
		그렇게 쳐다보지 마요
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:55	I know you hate me.
		날 미워하는 거 아니까
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	Guess what? Everyone hates me.
		이거 알아요?
		다들 날 미워해요
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	But you can't deny it.
		하지만 부정할 순 없죠
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	We were bad-ass.
		우리 정말 끝내줬단거
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:15	Uhh.
		 
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:23	Happens.
		이런 일도 종종 있죠
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:29	Jer...
		제레미..
00:39:31	 
		 
00:39:32	Are you ok?
		괜찮니?
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:34	I'm gonna go get some sleep.
		잠 좀 자야겠어
00:39:36	 
		 
00:40:12	What are you doing?

00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:29	The one you thought was a...
		네가 변했다고 생각했던..
00:40:31	 
		 
00:40:31	Yep.
		그래
00:40:33	 
		 
00:40:34	Turns out she's been dead all along.
		알고보니 여태껏
		죽어있었던 거더라
00:40:38	 
		 
00:40:40	She's the reason you wanted turn.
		그녀 때문에
		뱀파이어가 되고 싶었구나
00:40:42	 
		 
00:40:45	You wanted to be with her.
		그녀와 함께하고 싶어서
00:40:47	 
		 
00:40:55	Look, I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:40:57
