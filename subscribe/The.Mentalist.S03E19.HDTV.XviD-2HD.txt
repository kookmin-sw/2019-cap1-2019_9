00:00:15	Hey. Victim's name is John Flynn.
00:00:17	 
00:00:17	He's 48, married... Cho's
		bringing the wife now...
		존 플린, 48세, 기혼, 조 선배가 부인한테 가 있구요.
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	And C.E.O. of a company
		called Symphony.
		심포니라는 회사 CEO예요 
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	Symphony? Web site says it's a
		high-end matchmaking service.
		심포니? - 고품격 데이트 정보 회사래요
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	Rich old men looking for hot young chicks?
		돈 많은 노인네가 영계 찾는 그런데?
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Yep. Flynn was shot twice in
		the chest at close range,
		네 근접거리에서 가슴에 두발 맞고 
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	then dumped or fell in the water.
		물 속으로 던져진 것 같아요
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	A woman heard some pops from her boat,
		어떤 여자가 자기 배에 있다가 총소리를 들었는데 
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	putting the time of death
		at 5:38 P.M. last night.
		그게 어제 오후 5시 38분이었구요
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	Did she see anything?
		뭐 본 건 없대?
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	No. No witnesses.
		목격자는 없어요
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:41	Bruising looks to be a few days old.
		Coroner thought the same.
		멍든 자국은 며칠 된건데 
		- 검시관도 그러더라구요
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	So far he and forensics haven't
		found much else that helps us.
		하지만 검시팀에서 아직까지 대단한건 안 나왔어요
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:54	Jane, anything to add before we go?
		제인, 철수하기 전에 뭐 해줄 말 없어?
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	Yeah, the sun and the
		sea... isn't it wonderful?
		이 햇살, 이 바다... 굉장하지 않아?
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:01	Anything to add about the victim?
		희생자 말야
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:03	Rich guy, C.E.O.
		probably killed over money.
		돈이 많고 어디 경영자에, 돈 때문에 죽었겠지 
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	Way of the world.
		That's all you got?
		세상 일이 다 그렇듯이 - 그게 다야?
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	Do you know in seven years,
		each and every cell is
		7년이면 사람 몸의 모든 세포가 
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:10	completely replaced in your body?
		완전히 새것으로 바뀐다는거 알아?
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:12	That means you are literally
		a different person
		즉 우리가 처음 만났을때와 
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	from when we first met.
		Sadder but wiser.
		지금은 글자 그대로 다른 사람이란 뜻이야- 7년이라니 서글프지만 나아진 것도 있겠지 
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	He's very wet.
		홀딱 젖었구만 
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:21	That must mean something.
		거기 뭔가 있어 
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:39	Grieving widow? Yeah.
		미망인? - 네 
00:01:41	 
		 
00:01:49	Hello.
		안녕하세요
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	Hi.
		네 
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:51	You were watching me.
		절 보고 계시네요
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	Yes.
		그랬죠
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:55	Why? It's my job.
		왜요? - 제 직업입니다
00:01:57	 
		 
00:02:00	Your husband was murdered at the marina.
		남편분이 마리나에서 살해당하셨죠
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:02	Yes.
		네 
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:06	Sorry for your loss.
		유감입니다
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:08	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:02:09	 
		 
00:02:10	You seem genuinely upset.
		진심으로 애통해 하시는군요
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	Does that surprise you?
		그게 놀랄 일인가요?
00:02:13	 
		 
00:02:14	How long were you and
		your husband married?
		결혼하신지는 얼마나 되셨습니까? 
00:02:15	 
		 
00:02:15	I'm sorry. I don't know your name.
		Patrick.
		성함도 말씀 않으셨군요 - 패트릭입니다
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:19	Erica.
		에리카예요
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:21	About a year.
		결혼한지는 일년 정도죠
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:27	What do you see?
		뭘 보고 계시죠?
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:29	You're independent,
		ambitious, competitive,
		당신은 독립적이고, 야망이 있고, 경쟁을 좋아하지만 
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	yet you have a warmth about you...
		수도승같은 조 요원이 가드를 내릴 만큼 
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:33	Enough to charm the stoic agent Cho,
		인간적 매력이 있는 분이군요
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	which is no small feat, let me tell you.
		그럴 수 있는 사람이 몇 없거든요 정말로 
00:02:38	 
		 
00:02:38	You're skilled at getting people
		to open up to you, to trust you.
		사람들이 절로 마음을 열고 신뢰하게 하는 재주가 있으신가 봅니다 
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:42	And there's a question of
		whether you use that skill
		그 재주를 사람을 돕는데 쓰는지 
00:02:44	 
		 
00:02:44	to help people or to manipulate them.
		이용하는데 쓰는지가 궁금할 차례군요
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:49	A little of both, if I'm being honest.
		솔직히 말하자면 둘 다겠죠
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:52	I'm a matchmaker.
		I help people find true love.
		저는 커플 매니저예요 진정한 사랑을 찾아주죠
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:57	You think it's silly.
		비웃고 계시는군요
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	No. Good enough job, I imagine.
		전혀요 제 생각엔 멋진 일 같은데요
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	You think the idea of true love is silly.
		진정한 사랑이라는 걸 비웃고 계시잖아요
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	No.
		아뇨
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:06	That explains it.
		그럼 설명해 보시죠
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	Explains what?
		뭘요?
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	The utter sadness I see in you.
		당신에게서 엿보이는 그 지독한 슬픔에 대해서요
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:14	We're all finished, Mrs. Flynn.
		저희 일은 끝났습니다, 플린 부인 
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	I could walk you out, if you like.
		괜찮으시다면 바래다 드리죠
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:16	Thank you, agent Cho.
		You've been very good to me.
		고마워요, 요원 친절하시군요
00:03:19	 
		 
00:03:19	I'll walk her out, if you don't mind.
		Not at all.
		괜찮다면 내가 대신 모셔나갈게 - 그러세요
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	Sure.
		그럼, 
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:29	It was very nice to meet you, Patrick.
		만나서 반가웠어요 패트릭 
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	Hopefully next time, it'll be
		under better circumstances.
		다음엔 이보다 좋은 상황에서 만나고 싶군요
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:37	You know, every day women come to me,
		절 찾아오는 여성분들은 
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	hoping I'll help them find
		기꺼이 사랑하고 싶은 
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	a kind, gentle man to fall in love with.
		자상하고 친절한 남자를 꿈꾸며 오죠
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:46	I'm sure any one of them
		would be lucky to meet you.
		어떤 분이 되었건 당신과 함께가 되는 분은 참 운이 좋겠어요
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:55	What was that all about?
		다 뭐냐?
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:57	Oh, she's just thanking
		me for consoling her.
		위로해줘서 고맙대 
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	Oh, and here I thought you
		hated talking to widows.
		미망인 토크 싫어하는 줄 알았는데 
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	This one's a little different. How so?
		이번은 좀 달라 - 어디가?
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:06	She murdered her husband.
		저 여자, 남편을 죽였거든 
00:04:08

		Sync by YYeTs Corrected by ThreeSixes wwwaddic7edcom
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:18	You're right.
		Usually, it's the victim's spouse
		맞아, 희생자의 배우자가 범인인 경우가 많지 
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	who's the murderer, but
		Erica Flynn has an alibi.
		하지만 에리카 플린은 알리바이가 있어
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:24	Mm. I'd expect nothing less from her.
		그 정도도 없어서야 서운하지 
00:04:25	 
		 
00:04:25	One of her clients is in
		with Rigsby right now,
		그 여자 고객 중 하나가 릭스비랑 지금 같이 있는데 
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	and she swears that she was with
		살해 시각에 에리카와 같이 있었다고 
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	Erica at the time of death.
		Then I must be wrong.
		분명히 얘기했어 - 그럼 내가 틀린거네 
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	She did say that her husband
		got in a fight a few days ago,
		에리카 말론 남편이 며칠 전 싸움에 연루되었다던데 
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	he came home with a bruise.
		얼굴에 멍이 들어 귀가했다고 
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:36	She doesn't know who the fight was with.
		Any guesses?
		상대가 누구였는진 모르겠대 어떻게 생각해?
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	The reality is John Flynn ran a
		multi-million dollar company.
		존 플린은 수백만 달러짜리 회사를 굴렸고 
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	He had money, dozens of employees,
		돈도 있고 직원도 많고 
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:44	and a lot of ruthless competitors.
		악랄한 경쟁자도 많았겠지 
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	And Flynn's file also says that
		he gave half a million dollars
		게다가 파일을 보니까 작년에 50만 달러를 
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	to charity last year.
		자선단체에 기부했더군 
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	That's the first time
		he's ever done that. So?
		그것도 생전 처음한거래 - 그래서?
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	It's a red flag.
		How is giving to charity a red flag?
		이건 미심쩍은거지 - 자선단체 기부가 왜?
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	Giving to charity isn't a red flag.
		기부활동은 트집잡힐 만한게 아냐
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:58	Giving half a million dollars to
		charity, out of the blue, is.
		50만 달러를, 자선단체에, 밑도 끝도 없이 이건 
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	It's a sure sign of a guilty conscience.
		죄의식의 분명한 표지야
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	That is so far from the truth.
		Well, think about the people
		말도 안돼 - 그럼 이거 봐라 
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	that donate that kind
		of money to charity...
		그만한 금액을 기부하는 사람들의 면면을 보면 
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	All right, Wall Street
		executives, crooked politicians,
		월스트리트 경영자들, 부패한 정치인들, 
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	troubled celebrities...
		스캔들에 휩싸인 연예인들 
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:13	It is all in the name of
		다 죄의식의 부채를 
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	clearing their conscience.
		You're horrible.
		말소하려는 몸부림이라구 - 넌 생각하는게 글렀어 
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:17	How long have you been
		a member of Symphony?
		심포니에 가입하신지는 얼마나 되셨어요?
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:20	Oh, just a few days, actually.
		사실 며칠 안됐어요
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	Night before last was my first
		어젯밤이 에리카와의 
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	interview with Erica.
		And what time was this?
		첫 인터뷰였죠 - 그게 몇시쯤이었죠?
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	From 05:00 until just after 6:00.
		5시부터 6시 조금 넘어서까지요
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:27	And you're convinced that
		Erica Flynn was there
		그리고 에리카 플린은 인터뷰 내내 
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	the entire time? Yes.
		당신과 함께 있었구요? - 네
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	Can anyone confirm that?
		Oh, I think the rest of the staff
		확인해 줄만한 사람이 있나요? - 저희가 인터뷰를 시작할 즈음은
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	had already left the office
		by the time we started.
		다른 직원들은 모두 퇴근한 뒤였어요
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	I'm a litigator, so that was the
		earliest I could meet Erica.
		전 변호사라 그때밖에 시간을 뺄 수 없었거든요
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	Oh, it's probably why I joined
		the service in the first place.
		사실 그래서 이 회사에 가입했죠
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	It's not that I'm some
		social leper or anything.
		사교적인 데는 완전히 젬병이거든요
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	I mean, I can meet people.
		I meet people all the time. So... no?
		일적으로 사람은 항상 만나는 편이지만 그게... 
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:50	No.
		아시겠죠
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	But there's the DVD.
		여기 DVD를 가져왔어요
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	The DVD?
		Of the interview.
		DVD요? - 인터뷰 내용이요
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	Yeah, it's part of,
		uh, Symphony's service.
		심포니 가입하면 하는 거예요
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	A client interview, appearance counseling,
		인터뷰하면서 외모나 데이트 기술에 대해 
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	date coaching.
		조언을 해주죠
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	It's actually a very thorough
		approach to matchmaking.
		굉장히 알찬 서비스예요
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:05	Anyway, Erica was interviewing
		me the whole time.
		아무튼 에리카는 계속 저를 인터뷰했어요
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	Just see for yourself.
		갖다 보세요
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:13	Just... just... God, don't
		show it to too many people
		다만 음 너무 여럿이서 보진 마세요
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	'cause it's kind of embarrassing.
		조금 쪽팔려서요
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	And they haven't edited out
		제 이상한 표정이나 바보같은 말도 
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	all my silly faces, dumb comments yet.
		전혀 편집되지 않고 다 들어있어요
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Oh, my God. Okay, it's fine.
		어떡하지, 이걸... 그냥, 할 수 없죠
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	You can watch it.
		요원님은 보셔도 되요
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:26	I mean, for investigative
		purposes, obviously,
		제 말은, 사건 수사를 위해서요
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	not that if you wanted to
		watch it for other reasons
		업무랑은 상관 없는 
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	you couldn't.
		다른 이유로는 말구요
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:33	Got it. Uh, well, we'll call
		with any other questions.
		알겠습니다, 혹시 추가질문이 생기면 연락 드릴게요
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	Thanks for your time. Okay, right.
		Well, no, thank you.
		시간 내주셔서 감사합니다 - 제가 고맙죠
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:42	All right, I-I had...
		I have a question.
		저 음 질문이 있는데요
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:46	I... will just...
		그게 저 
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	Are you in a relationship?
		사귀는 분 있으세요?
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	No. Um, I'm not, actually.
		없어요, 음 없습니다
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:59	Well... good to know.
		잘됐네요
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:03	Uh, nice to meet you, agent Rigsby.
		만나서 반가웠어요, 릭스비 요원님 
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	Nice to meet you, Sarah.
		저도요, 사라
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:08	Uh, this way. Right.
		나가실 땐 이쪽입니다
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:14	Hey, boss.
		보스 
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	You gotta see this.
		이거 보세요
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:18	It's a video of John Flynn's
		ex-wife, Kim Cartwright.
		존 플린의 전처 킴 카트라이트예요
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:23	I found it online while doing background.
		뒷조사를 하다 인터넷에 이런게 도는걸 발견했어요
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:26	3 months ago, my husband of 21 years,
		세달전, 21년간 같이 산 내 남편 존 플린은 
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	John Flynn, told me he was divorcing me.
		나한테 이혼하겠다고 말했어요
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	John said he wanted to be alone,
		홀로 되고 싶다더군요
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	that he didn't want to be married anymore.
		결혼생활을 지속하고 싶지 않다면서
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	Well, John, this is what I think
		이봐, 존 이게 내 생각엔 아마도 
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	of your settlement agreement.
		이혼 합의서인것 같은데 말이야 
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:41	Word is out on you, John.
		I am going to tell everyone
		넌 끝장이야, 존 
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:45	exactly what kind of a man you are
		내가 사람들한테 니가 어떤 인간이었나 죄다 떠들고 다닐거야
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	because you are a pig!
		You are a coward!
		이 돼지같은 놈, 이 겁쟁아! 
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:50	I made that video almost a year ago.
		I was upset.
		그건 거의 일년전 비디오예요 전 화가 나 있었구요
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	You were more than upset, Ms. Cartwright.
		단순히 화가 난 그 이상이던데요, 카트라이트씨 
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	You threatened to make your
		ex-husband's life miserable.
		남편을 끝장낼거라 협박하셨잖아요
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	Talk to me when your
		ex-husband remarries
		당신 전남편이 당신보다 열살이나 어리고 
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	someone ten years younger
		and two sizes smaller.
		당신이 66일때 44입는 여자와 결혼했다 생각해봐요
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:06	Shh. Libby, no. No barking.
		쉿, 리비, 짖으면 안돼 
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:09	Where were you that night?
		그날밤 어디 계셨습니까?
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	I was home alone.
		집에 혼자 있었어요
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	I didn't kill John, if
		that's what you're thinking.
		만약 절 의심하신다면, 전 안 죽였어요
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:20	Oh, my God. That's what
		you're thinking. That's insane!
		정말 그렇게 생각하시나보네 말도 안되요!
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:24	John and I reconciled months ago.
		우린 몇달 전에 화해했어요
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	We... we spoke all the time.
		우린 서로 얘기도 많이 했어요
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:28	Including the afternoon he was murdered.
		플린씨가 죽은 날 오후에도 말이죠
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:31	Do you recall what you two talked about?
		대화 내용은 무엇이었습니까?
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:33	John was unhappy in his marriage,
		결혼생활이 불행하다고 했어요
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	and he needed someone to listen.
		얘기할 누군가가 필요하다고 했죠
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	So he called his ex-wife?
		그게 전처인가요?
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:39	Okay, it's complicated, all right?
		우린 복잡한 관계였어요
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	Shh. Shh. Bad dog. Shh. No bark.
		리비, 짖으면 나쁜 개야!
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:46	You said was unhappy in his marriage.
		Why?
		결혼생활이 불행했다고 말했다구요?
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	Well, John loved his
		company, but he was ready
		네 존은 회사를 아꼈지만 일선에서 물러나 
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	to step back and enjoy life, and
		Erica didn't feel that way.
		인생을 즐기고 싶어했어요 하지만 에리카는 그렇지 않았죠
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	She kept pushing him
		to expand Symphony.
		에리카는 회사를 확장시키고 싶어했어요
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	It caused problems between them.
		Shh!
		그 때문에 두사람간 불화가 생긴거죠 - 쉿! 
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:04	When we found John, he had a
		bruise over his left eye.
		플린씨 왼쪽 눈두덩에 멍이 들어 있던데요
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	He mentioned that he'd gotten into a fight
		예전 고객중 한명인 헨리 클리프와 
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	with an ex-client, Henry Cliff.
		다툼이 있었다고 했어요
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	You know what the fight was about?
		No, he was evasive.
		왜 다툰거죠? - 그건 분명히 말 않았어요
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	It was something he
		didn't want to share.
		말하기 껄끄러운 거였겠죠
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	Did you know Erica Flynn signed a prenup
		에리카 플린이 결혼전 재산분할 합의서를 작성한거 알아?
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	before she got married?
		You're barking up the wrong tree.
		번짓수 잘못 찾았어
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	Time coding puts the start
		of the meeting at 5:00 P.M.
		화면에 시간이 나오는걸 
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	It finishes just after 6:00,
		just like Sarah said,
		사라가 말한대로 6시 좀 넘어 끝나 
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:25	which means that Erica
		Flynn was at her office
		에리카 플린은 살해 시각에 
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:27	at the time of the murder.
		계속 회사에 있었다는 말이지 
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	Try to look directly into camera.
		It will allow
		카메라를 똑바로 바라보세요
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	your future soul mate to
		better connect with you.
		미래의 소울 메이트와 이어줄 겁니다 
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	What do you think of these dating
		services anyway? No and yes.
		이 데이트 회사라는거 괜찮은가? - 그렇기도 하고 아니기도 
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	What? No, I've never used
		one, and yes, you should.
		엉? - 난 한번도 안 가봤지만 너한테는 괜찮을거야
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	Oh, because you're cool, and I'm not?
		선배는 인기남이고 난 찌질이라서?
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	Anything to stop you
		dating your co-workers.
		니가 그거라도 해야 사내 연애를 끊을거 아니냐
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	How would your closest
		friends describe you
		당신을 전혀 모르는 사람에게 당신의 가장 친한 친구는 
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	to someone who doesn't know you?
		당신을 무어라 소개할까요?
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	Oh. Well, I think they would say...
		제 생각엔 아마도 
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:48	Uh, we have you scheduled
		to come in next Tuesday.
		다음주 화요일에 예약 잡아 드릴게요
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:52	Okay, great. See you then.
		좋습니다, 그때 뵐게요
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:56	Welcome to Symphony.
		If you'll just fill out this profile,
		심포니에 잘 오셨습니다 이것만 간단히 작성해 주세요
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	someone will be with you shortly.
		Profile.
		곧 저희 직원이 안내해 드릴거예요 - 프로필이라
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:02	Patrick. I see you two have met.
		패트릭, 여기서 보는군요
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:06	Peter's our reception clerk,
		though I doubt for much longer.
		피터는 우리 리셉셔니스트인데, 오래 가진 못할 것 같아요
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	He's a very talented musician,
		writes such beautiful music.
		뛰어난 재능을 가진 작곡가거든요
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	Patrick is a consultant with CBI.
		패트릭은 CBI에서 일하는 컨설턴트셔
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	He's investigating John's murder.
		존의 일을 수사중이시지
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:17	I'll hold your calls.
		통화는 제가 알아서 돌릴게요
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:23	We're all a little overwhelmed
		today, as you can imagine.
		짐작하시다시피 오늘 좀 부산스럽네요
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	I shouldn't even be here.
		제가 여기 있으면 또 안되는데 
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	But to be honest, I didn't
		have much of a choice.
		솔직히 말하면 달리 길도 없죠
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	With John gone, well, you understand.
		이제는 존도 없고 보셔서 아시겠지만 
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:34	Is there any news in the investigation?
		수사에는 진전이 좀 있나요?
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	No.
		아뇨
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:38	Do you have any more questions for me?
		Not really.
		제게 더 하실 질문이라도? - 별로요
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:43	I think I understand.
		이해합니다
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	Understand what?
		이해는 뭘 말입니까?
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	Why you're here. I wasn't sure
		at first when I saw your ring,
		왜 여기 계시는지요 처음 뵈었을땐 반지를 끼고 계셔서 긴가민가했어요
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:49	but you're single, aren't you?
		하지만 지금은 독신이시죠?
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	That's not why I'm here.
		그것 때문에 여기 있는게 아닙니다만 
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	There's nothing to be ashamed of, Patrick.
		전혀 부끄러워할 일이 아니에요, 패트릭 
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:55	I've helped a great many clients
		패트릭과 정확히 같은 상황에 계신 
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	in the exact same situation as you.
		많은 고객분들과 일해 봤어요
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	Well, I'm not in a situation.
		There's no situation.
		전 그런 상황에 있는것도 아니고 아예 상황이랄것도 없는데요
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	I know what you're feeling.
		I've been there.
		지금 어떤 기분일지 알아요 저도 겪어봤어요
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	Yeah, I don't think you have.
		그러셨을 것 같진 않은데요
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:06	You were in a relationship
		once, you were in love,
		당신은 한때 사랑을 했어요
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	but it ended badly, and you
		were deeply hurt as a result.
		하지만 그건 안 좋게 끝났고 당신은 상처 입었죠
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:12	You shut yourself off from the world
		당신은 세계로부터 자신을 단절시키고 
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	and avoid meeting new people
		새로운 사람을 들여놓지 않으려 해요 
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	because you don't want to
		ever feel that loss again.
		그 상실의 기분을 다시 맛보기 싫으니까요 
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:20	But now you're ready to
		move on with your life.
		하지만 이제 당신은 새로운 삶을 만들어 나갈 준비가 됐어요
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	I can see it in you.
		당신을 보면 알 수 있어요
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	You can find happiness
		again, even true love,
		당신은 다시 행복해질 수 있어요 다시 사랑할수도 있지요
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	but you have to be willing
		to let me help you.
		일단 내가 당신을 도울 수 있게 허락해 주세요
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:37	That was spooky.
		이거 오싹합니다
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:39	It was like you read my mind.
		마치 제 마음을 읽고 계신 것 같군요
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:42	Our in-house studio is right this way.
		저희 스튜디오가 건물 안에 있어요
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	It's where we conduct
		our client interviews.
		고객분들 인터뷰를 진행하는 장소죠
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:47	How many interviews have
		you conducted here?
		여기서 얼마나 많은 인터뷰를 진행하시죠?
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Enough to know what I'm doing.
		수도 없이 하죠
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:53	Whoa. That's bright.
		와아 밝은데요
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	Very fancy.
		시설이 좋습니다 
00:11:56	 
		 
00:11:59	We like to show our clients
		in the best possible light.
		고객분들을 위해 최선의 조명을 준비했죠
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	I thought true love was blind.
		진짜 사랑은 눈먼 사랑이라고들 하던데 
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	We may love with our hearts, but
		first we lust with our eyes.
		사랑은 가슴으로 하겠지만 일단 첫눈에 빠지는 것도 중요하니까요
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:08	Don't you agree?
		그렇지 않아요?
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:10	If you make yourself comfortable,
		we can get started. Here?
		마음의 준비가 되시거든 시작하죠
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	Yeah. Okay.
		좋아요
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:17	Try to look directly into the camera.
		카메라를 똑바로 바라보세요
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	It will allow your future soul mate
		그래야 미래의 소울 메이트와 
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	to better connect with you.
		이어드릴 수 있답니다
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:25	How's that?
		어떠세요?
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	Perfect. I'm gonna ask you
		좋습니다 - 이제 제가 
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	a series of standardized questions.
		늘 하는 질문 몇가지를 할게요
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	These have been designed to get
		at the heart of who you are
		질문을 통해 패트릭이 어떤 사람인지 
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	and who you're compatible with.
		어떤 사람에게 어울리는지 알 수 있을 거예요
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	Try to answer as honestly as possible.
		Ready? Yes.
		가능한한 솔직히 대답해 주세요 - 그러죠
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	Good. Now, Patrick,
		좋아요, 패트릭 
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:40	what kind of woman are you interested in?
		이상형의 여자는 어떤 사람이죠?
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:43	Rich, quiet blondes.
		돈이 많고 금발에, 
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	No snoring. That's a deal-breaker.
		코를 골면 안돼요 그럼 끝장이죠
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:48	We were told you
		punched out John Flynn.
		존 플린씨에게 주먹을 휘두르셨다던데
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Yeah, I hit John.
		그랬소
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	It was a misunderstanding.
		Who misunderstood what?
		하지만 그건 오해였소 - 누가 누굴 오해한 겁니까?
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	It was nothing, a tiff.
		Two days before he was murdered.
		그건 작은 언쟁에 불과했소 - 죽기 이틀전에 말이죠
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:01	Am I under arrest?
		내가 체포되는 거요?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	No, you're just a person
		of interest at this point,
		아직 용의선상에 계실 뿐입니다
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	a suspect. Unless you can
		몇가지 사항에 대해 
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	clear things up with a simple explanation.
		깔끔하게 답변해 주시지 않는다면요
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:11	All right.
		알겠소 
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:19	It was about a woman, okay?
		여자 때문에 그랬소
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	Naomi. Met her at a singles
		mixer John's company organized.
		존의 회사에서 주최한 파티에서 나오미를 만났소 
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	We hit it off at the bar,
		a few drinks, few laughs.
		바에서 몇잔 마시다 금방 친해졌지 
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Next thing I know, she
		invites me up to her room.
		그녀가 방으로 날 초대했소 
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	All right? I'm up there, what, two seconds,
		올라가자 그야말로 얼마 안되어 
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	boom... she is all over me.
		와우... 금방 달아오르더군 
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	I mean, really hot and really passionate.
		내 말은 그만큼 뜨겁고 열정적이었단 거요
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	Get to the part where you
		punch out John Flynn.
		존 플린에게 주먹질한 대목으로 즉시 부탁합니다
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	Yeah, right.
		알겠소 
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:44	Uh, two days later, I get a phone call.
		음, 이틀 뒤에 전화를 받았소
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:47	I think she wants another bite
		off the old Cliff bar, right?
		또 한잔 하자는 건줄 알았지 
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	No. Turns out the bitch is blackmailing me.
		하지만 그 나쁜 년은 날 협박하려 했소 
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:54	Says she videotaped our
		whole night together.
		그날 밤을 전부 녹화해 뒀다더군 
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:57	Says unless I give her $15,000,
		만오천 달러를 입금하지 않으면 
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	she's going public with that video.
		비디오를 공개하겠다고 했소 
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	You paid the money?
		돈을 지불했습니까?
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:05	Well, yeah.
		I can't have a sex tape going around.
		그랬지 섹스 비디오가 나다니게 할 순 없는거 아뇨
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:09	Look, I'm a Sac Metro top
		ten prestige realtor.
		난 Sac Metro에서 열손가락에 꼽히는 부동산업자요
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:13	My face is on the friggin' billboard.
		얼굴이 팔릴대로 팔려있단 말이오
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	I get respect in this community.
		난 이 지역 유지란 말요
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	So you went after Flynn.
		그래서 플린에게 갔군요
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:19	He's supposed to be screening
		these women, for Pete's sake.
		그딴 여자는 초기에 걸러냈어야지 
00:14:22	 
		 
00:14:22	But look, it's not what you think.
		하지만 당신들 생각하는 거랑 달리 
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	John and I talked it out.
		존과 난 대화로 끝냈소
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	He swore to me that he would
		handle it personally,
		자기가 개인적으로 알아봐서 
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	said he was gonna make sure she got caught
		그 여잘 감방에 처넣겠다고 
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	and put in jail for what she did.
		약속했단 말이오 
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:36	So much for that plan, right?
		누가 책임지고 죽으란 것도 아닌데, 안 그렇소? 
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:40	I have just one more question.
		하나만 더 물어볼게요
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:42	In an ideal world, what would
		you want your life to be like?
		마음대로 할 수 있다면 어떤 삶을 살고 싶으세요?
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	Haven't thought about that.
		생각해 본 적 없는데요
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	In an ideal world?
		마음대로 할 수 있다면?
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:53	A pet dragon, definitely,
		애완 드래곤이요
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:55	for flying around on. That would be good.
		이리저리 날아다니는 근사할 것 같아요
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:57	Please try and answer seriously.
		진지하게 대답해 주시겠어요
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	It's important.
		중요한 부분이에요
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	What do you want from your life?
		어떤 삶을 원하셨어요?
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:03	I want my life to be free.
		자유로운 삶이요
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:06	Free how? To love? To be loved?
		무엇으로부터요? 사랑하는 것? 사랑 받는것? 
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:08	Free from my past.
		과거로부터요
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:20	I wanna tell you something.
		말씀드리고 싶은게 있어요
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:22	Every day I introduce men
		and women to one another.
		매번 남자분 여자분들을 소개시켜 드릴때 
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:25	If I do my job well, those people connect.
		일이 잘 될때면 제겐 보여요
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	They spark.
		들어맞고, 불꽃이 튀죠
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	I can actually see it.
		저는 그걸 볼 수 있어요
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:33	Just like I see it in
		you right now with me.
		지금 제 앞에 있는 당신이 그렇듯이요
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:37	I don't say this to make
		you uncomfortable.
		듣고 불편하시라고 드리는 말씀은 아니에요
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:40	I say it because I want you to know,
		그냥 알고만 계세요
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	no matter how alone you feel,
		당신이 지금 아무리 외롭든, 
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	you are capable of finding
		love, of moving on.
		다시 사랑하며 앞으로 움직여 나갈 수 있어요
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	I was wondering when you'd do this.
		전 그거 하나만 궁금했어요
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:51	Do what?
		뭐요?
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:52	Try to manipulate me.
		당신이 언제 날 조종하려 들까 
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:54	I would never do that.
		그런 적 없는데요
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	I'm simply pointing out emotions
		I know you feel towards me.
		패트릭이 내게 느끼는 감정을 정확히 옮긴 것 뿐이에요
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	You're wrong. I don't feel
		anything like that towards you
		틀렸습니다 난 당신에게 아무것도 느끼지 않아요
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	for one very good reason...
		You murdered your husband.
		남편을 죽인 여자에게라니 더더군다나 안될 말이죠
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:07	That's not funny.
		좋은 농담은 아니네요
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	It wasn't meant to be.
		Why would I kill my husband?
		웃기려고 한 것도 아닌데요 - 남편을 왜 죽이겠어요?
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	Money, well, money and
		control of the company.
		돈인가, 돈과 회사 
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	Same difference, really.
		John was gonna leave you,
		그게 그거죠 존은 당신을 떠나려 했고 
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	and if he left, the company left with him.
		존이 떠난다는건 회사도 함께 가버린단 얘긴데 
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	Everything that you worked for,
		everything that you'd built...
		즉 당신이 일해온 모든 것, 당신이 쌓아온 모든게 
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	Gone.
		날아가 버린단 거죠 
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:26	And you couldn't let that happen.
		그걸 용서할 수 없었겠고
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	No.
		아니지
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	You're all about autonomy, control.
		지배하지 않으면 못견디는 성격이죠
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	Abused as a child, I expect.
		짐작컨대 유년기에는 학대받은 경험도 있을 겁니다 
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:37	I didn't kill my husband.
		난 남편을 죽이지 않았어요 
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:40	In fact, you don't actually
		believe I did. No?
		당신도 속으론 그렇게 생각 않잖아요 - 아닌데? 
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	No. You're simply doing
		맞아요 당신은 항상 그래왔을 거예요 
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	what you've been doing ever
		since your wife died...
		당신 아내가 죽은 뒤로는
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:48	Intentionally sabotaging
		any relationship
		당신을 동요시키는 모든 사람들을 거부함으로써 
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	by pushing away anyone who
		makes you feel something.
		어떤 관계의 가능성도 사전에 차단하고 있지요
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	You want me to be the killer
		내 앞에서 동요하는 본인이 싫으니까 
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	because you don't want
		to have feelings for me.
		내가 차라리 범인이길 바라는 거예요 
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:57	It's a tragic but natural response
		참 비극적이지만 당신이 아내 죽음에 대해 느끼는 
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	to the guilt you feel
		over your wife's death.
		죄의식을 감안하면 그럴 법한 일이죠 
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:02	I do push people away,
		사람을 거부하는 건 맞습니다 
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	and I do feel guilt over my wife's death,
		내 아내의 죽음에 죄의식을 느끼는 것도 맞습니다 
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	but that does not change
		하지만 그게 당신이 당신 남편을 죽였다는 사실을 
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	the fact that you murdered your husband.
		어떤 식으로든 바꿔놓진 않지 
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	I am more certain of it now than ever.
		난 지금 최고의 확신이 들어 
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:15	If that's the case,
		정말 그러시다면 
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	prove it.
		증명해 보시든지 
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:24	Where are we with the Flynn murder?
		플린 사건 진도 어디까지 나갔어?
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:27	Rigsby and I are still checking
		out Henry Cliff's alibi.
		릭스비와 전 아직 헨리 클리프 알리바이를 깨고 있습니다 
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	He said he was in a
		bar watching the game,
		바에서 경기를 봤다는데 
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	but we still haven't found
		anyone to confirm it.
		증인이 아직 안 나와요
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	Stay on it. What about the ex-wife?
		계속 알아봐 전처는? 
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	Still no alibi either,
		but I did find a lawsuit
		역시 알리바이는 성립 않는데, 
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Kim Cartwright filed against
		Flynn around the same time
		동영상을 올린 무렵 플린에 대해 고소한 기록이 나왔어요 
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	she posted that online video.
		Looks like it has something
		이혼 합의에 관해 
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	to do with the divorce settlement.
		고소한 걸로 보이구요
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	I'm having the courthouse
		법원에 관련 기록 요청중이에요
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	messenger over the files.
		And the blackmailer, Naomi?
		나오미인가 하는 여자는? 
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	Yeah, we're having some
		trouble tracking her down.
		추적하는데 애를 먹이네요
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	Symphony doesn't
		have that information?
		심포니 쪽에 자료 없었어?
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	It's all fake... photos, driver's
		license, social security number.
		사진, 운전면허, 사회보장번호 다 가짜예요
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	I mean, the forgery's good, so
		I can see how they missed 'em.
		위조가 그럴듯해서 속았을만 해요
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	All we have is Cliff's
		description of her,
		저희한테 있는건 클리프가 설명한 인상착의가 답니다
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	including a small tattoo near her hip.
		몸에 작은 문신이 있다는 거랑요
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	So basically, we have nothing to go on.
		그러니까 달리 말해 건덕지가 없단 거잖아 
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:01	Okay, let's start with what
		we do know about Naomi.
		나오미부터 시작해 
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	Uh, she targeted a rich, single man,
		돈 많고 독신인 남자를 찾아서 
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	with the purpose of extorting
		him, right? Right.
		한몫 뜯으려고 하는 거잖아, 그치? - 네 
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:10	So if she's done it once, she's
		probably done it before.
		이번에 했으면 전에도 했겠지 
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	Van Pelt, check into every
		dating service in the bay area.
		반펠트, 해변 지역 데이트 정보회사 다 털어봐
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	See if they've had any
		experience with Naomi.
		나오미랑 엮인데가 있는지 보라고 
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:20	Maybe we can get to her that way.
		On it.
		뭔가 나오는게 있을거야 - 알겠습니다 
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:24	There are 11 matchmaking
		services in the bay area,
		해변 지역엔 11곳 정보회사가 있는데 
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	four of which specifically
		cater to high-end clients.
		그중 네곳이 상류층을 상대로 합니다 
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	Did they know Naomi? No.
		어디 나오미를 안대? - 없구요
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	And none have reported
		any extortion claims,
		갈취 사건으로 신고된 것도 없습니다 
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	but I got to thinking,
		하지만 제 생각에, 
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	what if she's planning to blackmail again?
		같은 짓을 또 시도하려 들지 않을까요?
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	I checked with the companies in the area,
		그 지역 회사들을 쭉 보는데 
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	and one is planning a
		singles mixer tonight.
		오늘밤 파티를 주최하는 곳이 하나 있더라구요
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	On a hunch, I cross-checked Naomi's profile
		직감에 심포니에서 작성한 
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	from Symphony with all the
		profiles of the women
		나오미 프로필이랑 대조해 보니까 
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	listed as attending the event.
		오늘밤 참석자 명단에서 
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	I got a match... a woman
		named Viktoria Shays.
		한명 나왔어요 이름은 Viktoria Shays
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	No photo, but several answers
		she gave about herself
		사진은 없지만 개인 신상에 관한 답변들이 
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	are identical to Naomi's.
		Is Rigsby here?
		나오미 것과 일치했어요 - 릭스비 밖에 있어?
00:18:59	 
		 
00:19:00	Yeah, somewhere.
		어디 있겠죠 
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	Tell him to go home and put on a nice suit.
		집에 가서 좋은 옷 입고 나오라고 해 
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	He's got plans tonight. All right.
		오늘밤 출동이라고 - 알겠습니다 
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	Have you seen my laptop? No.
		내 노트북 못 봤어? - 모르겠는데요
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:12	Now, Sarah, what kind of
		men are you interested in?
		사라, 이상형의 남자는 누구죠?
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Wow, right to it.
		그렇군요
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:20	Now, Patrick,
		그럼, 패트릭
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	what kind of woman are you looking for?
		이상형의 여자는 어떤 사람이죠?
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Quiet, rich blondes.
		돈이 많고, 금발에, 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	No snoring. That is a deal-breaker.
		코를 골면 안돼요 그럼 끝장이죠
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:28	How would your closest friends describe you
		당신을 전혀 모르는 사람에게 당신의 가장 친한 친구는
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	to someone who doesn't know you?
		당신을 무어라 소개할까요?
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:32	Oh. Uh, well, I think they...
		제 생각엔 아마도... 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:36	Now, Patrick, what kind of
		woman are you looking for?
		그럼 패트릭, 이상형의 여자는 어떤 사람이죠?
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	Quiet, rich blondes.
		돈이 많고, 금발에, 
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	No snoring. That is a deal-breaker.
		코를 골면 안돼요 그럼 끝장이죠
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:45	Now, Sarah, what kind of
		men are you interested in?
		사라, 이상형의 남자는 누구죠?
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:49	Wow, right to it.
		그렇군요
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:52	So what do you think?
		어때?
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	I think you look good.
		Thank you. Cho?
		멋진걸 - 고마워 선배는? 
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	I'm not answering that question. Oh,
		난 빼줘 
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	come on. Honestly, just
		tell me what you think.
		제발, 솔직하게 어떻게 보이는지 말해줘 
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:01	You look all right. Thanks.
		괜찮다 - 고마워 
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:04	I think you look great,
		정말 근사해보여
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	like you have money, a career...
		돈도 많고 경력도 화려하고 
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:08	A perfect target for Naomi.
		나오미가 군침 흘릴만 해 
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	I don't know.
		What if she doesn't go for it?
		그런데 관심 없으면 어떡하지?
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:12	- She will.
		- What if she doesn't go for me?
		될거야 - 내가 별로면 어떡하지?
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	I mean, there's gonna be a
		lot of single guys there.
		내 말은 거기 여자 꼬시려는 남자로 가득한데 
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	For this to work, she has
		to be interested in me.
		작전이 되려면 나오미가 나한테 꽃혀야 한단 말야
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	She will. Just be yourself.
		그럴거야 너답게만 행동해 
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	That's a terrible idea.
		그랬다 망하지 
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:21	Maybe I should do an accent or something.
		억양을 다르게 해볼까 
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	I don't think you need an accent.
		Hello. Rigsby.
		그럴 필요 없을것 같은데 - 안녕하세요, 릭스비입니다
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	Wayne Rigsby from Sussex.
		Uh, pleasure to meet you.
		웨인 릭스비고, 서섹스에서 태어났죠 만나서 반가워요
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	Cheerio.
		훌랄라 
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:34	How's that?
		Yeah, don't do the accent.
		어때? - 그거 하지 마라 
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:46	Rigsby, can you hear me?
		릭스비, 들려?
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:49	Loud and clear.
		잘 들려요
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:53	Van Pelt, you in position?
		반펠트, 위치야?
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	I'm here.
		네 
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:57	Gentlemen.
		신사 여러분 
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:59	Can I have your attention?
		It's time for me
		주목해 주시겠어요?
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	to bring in the beautiful women
		you'll be meeting tonight.
		이제 오늘 저녁 함께 하실 아름다운 여성분들을 모실 차례인데요
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:04	Don't forget the a-b-c's...
		작업의 정석 잊지 마세요
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	Attentiveness, boldness, confidence.
		정중하게, 확실하게, 자신감 있게 
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	You'll do great.
		행운을 빌어요
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:28	Rigsby, the event hostess
		주최측에 알아보니 
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	has I.D. Naomi.
		나오미 이름으로 온 여자가 있어 
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:31	Excuse me one moment.
		잠시만요
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:36	Okay, which one is she?
		그래서 누구예요?
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:38	The blonde in the lavender sheath.
		라벤더색 드레스의 여자 
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:40	The one in the what now?
		The blonde in the purple dress.
		라 뭐요? - 보라색 말야
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:49	Got it.
		찾았습니다
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	Are you sure it's her?
		확실한 거예요?
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:51	No. Find out if she's got
		a rose tattoo on her hip.
		벗겨서 장미 문신까지 찾아봐야
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:55	Then we'll know for sure.
		I'm moving in.
		확실한 줄 알지 - 움직일게요
00:21:58	 
		 
00:22:03	Hello, red.
		안녕, 빨강머리 
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:07	Can I buy you a drink?
		I'm engaged.
		내가 술 한잔 사도 될까? - 저 약혼했어요
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	Well, it's never too late for
		one last... keep walking.
		아직 결혼한건 아니잖아 - 가던 길 가시지 
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:13	Okay.
		알았어
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:26	Hi. I'm Wayne.
		안녕, 웨인이라고 해요
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:30	I'm Viktoria.
		난 빅토리아
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:31	Nice to meet you.
		반가워요
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:36	So what do you do, Wayne?
		무슨 일 하세요, 웨인?
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	I'm a businessman.
		E-commerce, mainly.
		사업가예요 주종목은 인터넷 비즈니스
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:42	How's that going for you?
		잘 되가요?
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:44	It's working out pretty well.
		순조로운 편이죠
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:46	I have a very diverse portfolio.
		내 이력은 꽤 다채롭답니다
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:49	And I have a room upstairs.
		나한텐 위에 방이 있는데 
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:51	And you're very direct.
		화끈하시네요
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Is that a problem?
		그게 문제가 되나요?
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	I'm trying to think of a
		reason why it might be,
		그게 문제가 되려나 한참 생각했는데 
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	and I can't really think of one right now.
		당장은 생각이 안 나네요
00:22:57	 
		 
00:23:07	Are you nervous?
		긴장타요?
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:08	Me? No.
		저요? 아뇨
00:23:09	 
		 
00:23:10	Yeah, maybe a little.
		어쩜 조금일까요
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:12	Well, don't be. I won't bite.
		그럴거 없어요 해치지 않아요
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:15	Good. Me either. No biting.
		좋네요 저도 그래요
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:18	3-1-6... my favorite number.
		316이라, 내 행운의 숫잔데
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	3-1-6.
		삼-일-육 
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:22	Uh, just curious, uh, do
		you have any tattoos?
		그, 그냥 궁금해서 그러는데 혹시 문신 있어요?
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:26	Um, why don't you come and find out?
		들어와서 찾아보지 그래요?
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:29	Okay.
		네 
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:35	So come in.
		들어오세요
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:37	Make yourself comfortable.
		I'll be right out.
		곧 나올테니 편하게 계시구요
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:43	Thanks.
		고마워요
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:53	Guys? You hear me?
		이봐요들? 다들 거기 있어요?
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:56	She's in the bathroom.
		여자가 화장실에 들어갔어요
00:23:58	 
		 
00:24:03	Wow. That is a, um,
		와우 아, 음 
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:05	very... nice tattoo.
		문신 멋지네요
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:08	Of a rose.
		장미 문신이라니 
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:10	It's a rose tattoo.
		문신을 장미 모양으로 
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	Mm.
		음 
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:15	Uh, maybe we should have a drink first
		저기 그 전에 뭐라도 한잔 하지 않을래요
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:18	or, uh, you know, uh...
		그러니까 
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:21	A snack.
		다과라도 
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:24	So would you call yourself
		adventurous, Wayne?
		모험을 좋아하나요, 웨인?
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	Adventurous?
		Um, what, like skydiving?
		모험이요? 스카이 다이빙 같은거 말씀이신가?
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:30	Mm, no.
		그런거 말구요
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:39	Uh, sorry to interrupt.
		한창 바쁘신데 죄송하게 됐습니다
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:42	Mm. CBI.
		CBI입니다 
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	Uh, yeah, found the, uh, tattoo.
		This is definitely the suspect.
		어, 거, 음 문신 찾았구요, 용의자가 맞습니다 
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	Nice work.
		멋졌어 
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:49	Yeah. Your collar.
		너 셔츠 카라
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:52	Your arrest, Wayne.
		네가 체포해야지, 웨인 
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:54	Oh, yeah.
		그렇네요
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:56	You're under arrest.
		당신은 체포됐다 
00:24:57	 
		 
00:25:00	Patrick.
		패트릭 
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:02	I'm surprised to see you're back.
		또 볼 줄 몰랐네요
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	Are you here to finish your profile?
		인터뷰를 완성하러 오셨나요?
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:06	No. I saw something strange
		당신이 알리바이로 제출한 DVD에서 
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	on the DVD you're using as your alibi,
		이상한걸 발견했기에 말이죠
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:12	so I came by to test out a theory.
		가설을 시험할 겸 왔지요
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:14	So you're still trying to
		prove I murdered my husband?
		제가 남편을 죽였다는걸 여직 증명하시려는 건가요?
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	You're still worried I will?
		Come on in.
		증명할까봐 걱정됩니까? - 오세요
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:25	Why don't you have a seat?
		앉으시겠습니까?
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:27	You want to interview me?
		Why?
		절 인터뷰하시게요? 왜요?
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:29	Like I said, I have a theory. You scared?
		아까 말했다시피 가설이 있으니까요 겁이라도 납니까? 
00:25:32	 
		 
00:25:33	No. It might be good
		제 고객들이 어떤걸 겪는지 
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	for me to experience what
		my clients go through.
		한번 경험해보는 것도 좋겠죠 
00:25:37	 
		 
00:25:45	You can ask questions
		from in there, yes? Yes.
		이 안에서 진행해도 되겠지요? - 그러세요
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:49	Thank you.
		What have you got up your sleeve?
		속셈이 뭐예요?
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:52	Patience.
		기다려 봐요
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:57	Okay.
		좋아 
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:01	Can you hear me?
		들립니까?
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:02	Yes.
		네 
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:04	Okay, Erica,
		좋아요, 에리카 
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:06	tell me, what kind of man
		are you looking for?
		이상형의 남자는 어떤 사람입니까?
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:09	I'm not looking. I'm mourning.
		난 상중이에요
00:26:11	 
		 
00:26:11	Yes. Uh, please humor me.
		대충 맞춰줘봐요
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:16	Someone kind
		자상하고 
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	and generous,
		관대한 사람 
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	someone patient.
		참을성이 많은 
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:23	I'm sorry. I'm really not
		comfortable talking about this.
		미안하지만 이런 얘길 하는 기분이 썩 좋지 않네요
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:31	Patrick?
		패트릭?
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:33	How would your closest friends describe you
		당신을 전혀 모르는 사람에게 당신의 가장 친한 친구들은
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	to someone who doesn't know you?
		Patrick, what are you doing?
		당신을 뭐라고 소개할까요? 패트릭, 무슨 짓이죠?
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	How would you describe yourself
		당신을 전혀 모르는 사람에게 당신의 가장 친한 친구들은
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	to someone who doesn't know you?
		What's going on in here?
		당신을 뭐라고 소개할까요? 안에서 뭐하는 거예요?
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:44	I'm proving my theory.
		가설을 증명하고 있죠
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:46	I heard a strange sound on the DVD
		제출한 DVD에서 이상한 소리가 들렸거든요
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	you're using as your alibi...
		A faint clicking noise.
		희미한 딸깍이는 소리 
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Almost mechanical.
		기계음에 가까운 
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:53	Then I figured out what it was.
		그러자 의문이 풀렸죠
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:59	how would you describe
		yourself to some...
		당신을 전혀 모르는 사람에게 당신의 가장 친한 친구들은
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:01	A simple tape recorder,
		단순한 녹음기 
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	just like this one.
		딱 이런 거죠
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:05	I knew you weren't
		here for the interview.
		당신은 인터뷰 진행중 자리를 비웠습니다
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:08	How could you be?
		You're off killing your husband.
		왜? 남편을 죽이러 가야 하니까 
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	But how do we explain
		your voice on the DVD?
		그럼 DVD 속 당신 목소리는 뭘까?
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:13	This is ridiculous.
		Recording the interview is easy.
		어이가 없군요 - 인터뷰 내용을 녹음하는 건 쉽죠
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:17	After all, you've done hundreds of them.
		아무튼간에 수도 없이 해봤을 테니까 
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	And once you had the recorder in
		place, you had plenty of time
		일단 녹음기를 여기 두면, 당신은 저 문을 통해 나가서 
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:22	to leave through that
		door, kill your husband,
		남편을 죽이고 오기에 충분한 시간을 벌게 되죠
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	and come back here without
		anyone noticing you're gone.
		당신이 들고 나는지 아무도 모르게 하면서요
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:27	But there is one thing you needed
		하지만 당신의 이 계획이 성공하기 위해선 하나 
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	in order for your plan
		to work... an accomplice.
		공범이 필요해요
00:27:33	 
		 
00:27:33	You needed someone to be here
		여기 있으면서 
00:27:35	 
		 
00:27:36	and to play the recorded
		questions at the right time.
		제 시간에 녹음기를 작동시킬 누군가요 
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:38	That's the one loose end you left untied.
		그게 바로 당신의 숨기지 못한 꼬리죠
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:42	That explains it, doesn't it?
		설명이 되네요 
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:46	Of course there's just one problem.
		한가지 문제가 있지만 
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:55	So if what you're saying is true,
		이제 당신 가설이 맞다고 치면 
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:57	I walked out right past my client
		난 인터뷰 중인 내 고객 앞으로 
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	in the middle of her interview.
		뻔히 보이게 지나갔다는 결론에 이르는군요 
00:28:01	 
		 
00:28:03	Yeah. Something she would
		have mentioned, huh?
		제 고객분이 그렇게 말하던가요?
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:07	I didn't kill my husband, Patrick.
		난 남편을 죽이지 않았어요, 패트릭 
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:12	I do understand.
		이해는 해요 
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:13	After all you've been through,
		you see evil everywhere.
		당신이 겪어온 일들을 감안하면 당신 눈 앞은 악으로 가득하겠죠
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	I see you.
		내 앞엔 당신 뿐인데 
00:28:17	 
		 
00:28:18	Patrick.
		패트릭 
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:20	You are a kind, clever, wonderful man.
		당신은 친절하고, 영리하고, 놀라운 사람이에요
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	You have so much potential.
		당신에겐 잠재력이 있어요
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:27	But you have to stop
		this obsessive behavior.
		하지만 먼저 그 편집증에서 벗어나야 해요
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:30	You need to get a life.
		당신 삶을 살아야 한다구요
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:34	Good night, Erica.
		잘 자요, 에리카
00:28:35	 
		 
00:28:37	Good night, Patrick.
		잘 가요, 패트릭 
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:44	All you've proven is that Erica Flynn
		에리카 플린이 남편을 죽였다는 데만 온통 매달려 있는데, 
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	may have murdered her
		husband, not that she did.
		그 여자는 결백하잖아 
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:49	Which is why I need to find her accomplice.
		그러니까 공범을 찾으려는 거지 
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	If there is an accomplice.
		There's no "if"".
		만약 공범이 있다면 말이야, - 만약이 아니라 확실해 
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:53	Yes, there is. We've got other
		viable suspects on this thing.
		그래, 있다 치자 하지만 우리한텐 다른 유력한 용의자도 있어
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	Like who? Like Naomi, for one.
		누구? - 나오미
00:28:59	 
		 
00:28:59	Naomi? She's a greedy
		opportunist that hates men.
		나오미? 그 여잔 남성 혐오증을 앓는 탐욕스런 기회주의자에 불과해 
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	She's not a cold-blooded killer.
		냉혈한 살인자가 못 돼 
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:03	We don't know that for sure.
		그건 장담 못해 
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:07	You always say that the simplest answers
		넌 항상 가장 단순한 설명이 
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:09	usually are the most
		likely, but it seems like
		가장 개연성이 높은 설명이라고 했지만 
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	you're coming up with more
		and more elaborate scenarios
		이번엔 니 말이 맞다고 우기느라 
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:14	just to prove that you're right.
		가설은 점점 더 꼬여만 가잖아 
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	Erica killed her husband.
		에리카는 자기 남편을 죽였어 
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:18	I am 100% sure of it.
		일백퍼센트 확신해 
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:21	I don't get it.
		난 모르겠다 
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:23	What is it about this woman?
		그 여자 어디가 어때서?
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	Why are you so obsessed with her?
		왜 그렇게 집착하는데? 
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:28	Because she doesn't think
		왜냐면 그 여잔 
00:29:30	 
		 
00:29:30	I'm smart enough to catch her.
		날 자기보다 한수 아래로 보거든 
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:33	Oh, well, that's a good reason.
		그러셨어요 이해가 되고도 남네요
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	Healthy. Professional.
		지극히 상식적이고 프로다운 이유네요
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:38	Uh, just answer me one more thing.
		한가지만 더 물어보자 
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:41	Okay, if Erica Flynn did
		murder her husband,
		만약 에리카 플린이 범인이라면 
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:44	how did she leave the room
		without her client noticing?
		고객 모르게 무슨 수로 그 방을 나갔던 걸까?
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:49	That I don't know.
		고걸 내가 몰라 
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:51	But I'm working on it.
		하지만 금방 알아올게 
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:57	You're going to jail, Naomi.
		당신은 감옥에 갈 겁니다, 나오미 
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:59	Nothing can prevent that from happening,
		그건 바뀌지 않는 사실이지만 
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:01	but you can help yourself out here.
		당신이 할 수 있는게 한가지 남아있죠
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	Tell me what you know about John Flynn.
		존 플린에 대해 아는대로 말해봐요
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	Nothing.
		I've never even met him.
		만난 적도 없는걸요
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:05	Now we both know that's not true.
		우리 둘다 그게 거짓말이란걸 알죠
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:08	John Flynn ran Symphony.
		He found out you were
		존 플린은 심포니 사장이고, 
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	blackmailing his clients and
		confronted you, didn't he?
		자기 고객을 협박했다는 이유로 당신과 다퉜습니다 그렇죠?
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	I never blackmailed anyone.
		난 사람 협박한 적 없어요
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	But we have multiple victims
		who claim otherwise.
		우리는 당신 피해자 증언을 여럿 갖고 있습니다 
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	We have the video camera
		you hid in your hotel room
		당신이 다른 피해자 상대로 호텔방에 숨겨놓은 
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	with other victims on it.
		비디오 카메라도 갖고 있죠
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:21	You watched that tape?
		그걸 봤다구요?
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:24	Did any of those guys
		look like victims to you?
		거기 나오는 남자들이 피해자로 보이던가요?
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:27	They look like Johns being
		conned by a clever prostitute.
		영리한 창녀에게 사기당한 사람들로 보이더군요
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:30	I'm not a prostitute.
		난 창녀가 아니에요
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:32	Where were you between the
		hours of 5:00 and 6:00
		플린이 살해당하던 날 17시에서 18시 사이 
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	the night of the murder?
		I want my lawyer.
		어디 있었습니까? - 변호사 불러주세요
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:37	I've got nothing more to say to you.
		더 이상 말하고 싶은게 없어요
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	Okay.
		좋습니다 
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:41	But we're waiting on a warrant
		to search your apartment.
		하지만 곧 당신 집에 대해 수색 영장이 나올 겁니다
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	You talk now, we can make a deal.
		여기서 털어놓으면 형량 거래가 가능합니다 
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:45	We find anything linking you to the murder,
		수색 결과 당신과 살인을 연결짓는 뭐라도 나오면 
00:30:47	 
		 
00:30:47	all bets are off. Lawyer.
		딜은 없습니다 - 변호사요
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:52	Uh, yes, Erica interviewed
		me from the A.V. room,
		아 맞아요, 에리카는 스튜디오에서 절 인터뷰했지만 
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	but she never left. Are you sure?
		나간 적은 없어요 - 확실합니까?
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	Yes. She would've had
		to walk right past me.
		그럼요 나가려면 제 옆으로 나갔어야 하는데요
00:30:58	 
		 
00:31:03	What are you doing?
		During your interview,
		뭐하세요? - 인터뷰 하면서 
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	do you remember how bright the
		lights were in that room? Yes.
		조명이 얼마나 강했는지 기억합니까? - 네 
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	Shining right in your face, in fact.
		Well, I guess so.
		얼굴 앞에 바로 쪼이던 거요 - 아마도요
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:12	Yes, I once had a job onstage.
		전 예전에 무대에서 일한적이 있어서 
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	I'll never forget how
		bright those lights can be.
		조명이 얼마나 밝을 수 있는지 잘 알죠
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:17	What does that have to do with anything?
		이게 뭐 중요한 건가요?
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:19	I'll show you. Keep your eye on your phone.
		보여드릴게요 잠시 전화기를 보고 계세요
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:24	What are you doing?
		뭐하시는 거예요?
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:28	It's gone.
		사라졌네요?
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:31	Precisely.
		바로 그렇습니다 
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:34	Hey, is that Sarah still here?
		사라 아직 있어?
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:37	Why? Just had a few, uh,
		follow-up questions
		왜? - 질문할게 좀 남아서
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	about the investigation.
		사건 관련해서 말야
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:41	You're such a bad liar.
		She left five minutes ago.
		거짓말 참 못한다 몇분 전에 갔어
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:44	Really? Just call her up and ask her out.
		What's the big deal?
		진짜? - 그냥 전화해서 만나자고 해 뭐 어렵다고? 
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:48	I can't do that.
		It's totally unprofessional.
		난 못하겠어 프로답지 못하잖아 
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	Unless she says yes. I think she'd say yes.
		만약 또 여자도 그러자 하면, 그러자고 할거 같긴 한데 
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:53	I mean, she asked me if I was single.
		왜냐면, 나한테 싱글이냐고 물어봤다고 
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:55	Why would she ask if I was single
		나랑 데이트 할 생각이 있는게 아니면 
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	unless she wanted me to ask her out, right?
		왜 거기서 싱글 여부 같은걸 물어봤겠어?
00:31:57	 
		 
00:32:13	Sarah, hi. It's, uh, Wayne Rigsby from CBI.
		사라, 음 CBI의 웨인 릭스비예요
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:22	If you keep up with these visits,
		이런 식으로 자꾸 찾아오시면 
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:24	I'm gonna have to start charging you.
		상담 비용을 청구하는 수 밖에 없네요
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	Oh, this will be the
		last one, I assure you.
		이게 마지막이 될테니 안심하시죠
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:28	Oh. Have you given up on this nonsense
		내가 남편을 죽였다고 생떼를 쓰던걸 
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	about me killing my husband?
		그만 단념하기로 하셨나봐요?
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	Nope, not at all. Not one little tiny bit.
		아뇨 전혀요 요만큼도 아닌데요
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	Well, then you must have cracked the case.
		그럼 이제 사건 종결만 남았네요
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	Please tell me. I'm curious to know
		말씀해 보세요 이젠 저도 제 공범이 누군지 
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	who this evil accomplice of mine is.
		제발 좀 알고 싶어질 정도니까 
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	Well, I came by it rather
		easily, I must say,
		사실은 저도 답을 얻는데 애를 먹었어요
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	after a-a friend got me
		thinking on the right path.
		친구 하나가 정확하게 조언하기 전까지는요
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:46	Which path is that?
		뭐라고 하던가요?
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	The simplest answer is most
		likely the correct one,
		가장 단순한 설명이 가장 그럴듯한 설명이다 
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:51	which means your accomplice is
		즉 당신의 공범은 
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	someone you can easily manipulate...
		당신이 쉽게 조종할 수 있는 
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	A man, which is obvious enough,
		당신의 신체적 매력을 감안해 남자인건 거의 확실하고 
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:58	given your physical attributes.
		I'm really getting tired...
		슬슬 지겨워져 가는군요
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	I'm not finished.
		내 말 아직 안 끝났어요
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	He's also young and impressionable, weak,
		젊고, 동요하기 쉬우며, 불안하고, 
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	but above all, someone you can
		make fall in love with you,
		무엇보다도 당신이 쉽게 유혹할 수 있는, 
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:09	and someone naive enough to believe
		또 너무 순진한 나머지 
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:11	that you had fallen in love with them.
		당신이 실제 자길 사랑하는 줄 믿는 사람이죠
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:13	Guess who I'm thinking of.
		누굴 가리키는 건지 맞춰봐요
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:15	Yes, that's right.
		그렇습니다
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:17	Your assistant Peter.
		당신의 PA 피터예요
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:24	You have no idea what you're talking about.
		당신이 무슨 소릴 하는지 모르겠군요
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:27	Ah, we'll find out soon enough.
		곧 우리 모두 알게 될 겁니다
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:31	What's going on?
		대체 뭐죠?
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:34	Mrs. Flynn, we'd like you to
		come back to the office with us,
		플린 부인, 서까지 동행해 주셔야겠습니다 
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	answer a few questions.
		Of course. Anything to help.
		몇가지 질문 드릴게 있어서요 - 물론이죠
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:48	How long do you think it'll take
		before he tells me everything?
		저 친구가 전부 불때까지 얼마나 걸릴까요?
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:52	Hmm?
		 
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:58	How you holding up, Peter?
		좀 어떠신가, 피터군? 
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:00	I'm tired.
		피곤하네요
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:03	Ah, not to worry.
		You won't be here much longer.
		걱정 마, 금방 나갈테니까 
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:05	I know you're not gonna
		talk, and I know why.
		아무 말도 않겠지 왜인지는 알고 있어
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:10	You're in love with Erica.
		에리카를 사랑하니까
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:12	No, that's okay. You don't need to deny it.
		괜찮아, 부인할 필요는 없어 
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:14	I get it.
		She's beautiful, she's smart,
		이해해 에리카는 아름답고, 영리하고
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	she's successful.
		성공한 여자니까 
00:34:17	 
		 
00:34:19	Makes you wonder, though, right?
		Wonder what?
		자넨 늘 궁금했지 - 뭘요?
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:24	What she sees in you,
		대체 그녀가 자네의 뭘 좋게 본건지 
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:27	apart from her alibi.
		I mean, let's be honest here, Peter.
		알리바이 얘기는 일단 제쳐놓고, 솔직해지자구, 피터 
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	You don't really have that
		much to offer her. That's not true.
		자넨 에리카에게 줄게 별로 없잖아 - 그렇지 않아요
00:34:33	 
		 
00:34:33	Oh, so you are having an affair.
		I-I-I did not say that.
		사귀고는 있다는 거네 - 그, 그런말 한 적 없어요
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	Right. We're being honest here, Peter.
		그건 그래 솔직하게 말이야, 피터 
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	Deep down, do you really
		think that she loves you?
		자네 마음 깊은 곳에서, 에리카가 정말 자넬 사랑하는 것 같나?
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:43	Or are you just kidding yourself
		아님 그녀와 있으면 기분이 좋으니 
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:45	because it feel so nice to be with her?
		이런 식으로 자네 자신을 기만하는 중인가?
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	No. I love her, and she loves me.
		아뇨, 난 에리카를, 에리카는 날 사랑해요
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	She was using you.
		에리카는 자넬 이용하고 있어
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:52	She made you an accessory to murder.
		You're wrong.
		자넬 살인의 도구로 썼다고 - 아니에요
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:56	She got what she wanted from you
		에리카는 자네를 이용할만큼 했고 
00:34:57	 
		 
00:34:57	and now she is done with you.
		Stop. Stop saying that.
		이젠 그 볼일이 끝났어 - 그만두세요
00:34:59	 
		 
00:34:59	She doesn't love you, Peter.
		She never did. Now tell me
		에리카는 자넬 사랑하지 않아, 피터 그런 적도 없었지 
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	what happened the night
		Erica murdered her husband.
		그러니 에리카가 남편을 죽이던 날 무슨 일이 있었는지 말해봐 
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:05	She problem told you that
		he was abusing her, right?
		남편이 자길 학대한다고 했겠지? 
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:09	Smacking her around, raping her?
		I don't care what you say.
		폭행하고, 강간도 하고? - 당신이 뭐라건 소용 없어요
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	I'm not gonna hurt Erica.
		난 에리카를 배신 않아요
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:25	What do we do now?
		우리 지금 뭐하는 거니?
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:30	Jane?
		제인?
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	Let him go.
		저 친구 보내줘
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:43	Hi, Wayne.
		안녕, 웨인 
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:44	Oh, hey. Wow. You look amazing.
		당신 정말 근사한데요
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	Oh, thanks. So do you.
		고마워요 웨인도 멋져요
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:50	Oh, are you ready to go? Yeah.
		나갈 준비 됐어요? - 그럼요
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:58	I was hoping you'd call me.
		전화해 줬으면 했어요
00:35:59	 
		 
00:35:59	Yeah, I'm glad I did. Me, too.
		전화해서 다행이네요
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:13	Hard at work, I see.
		일이 힘든가보죠
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:16	Mm.
		 
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:18	What do you want?
		뭐하는 겁니까?
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	I'd like to thank you for
		having me brought down here.
		여기 데려와 고맙다는 인사를 하려구요
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	That was very courteous of you.
		당신치곤 정중했어요
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:25	Though I have to admit, I
		was a little surprised
		당신 동료가 너무 쉽게 
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	your colleagues decided
		to simply let me go,
		날 보내주려는 데는 솔직히 좀 놀랐지만 
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:30	you being so certain
		of my guilt and all.
		당신은 내 혐의를 믿어 의심치 않는데 말이죠
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:33	Let me guess... Peter
		didn't say a word to you?
		맞춰볼까요... 피터한테서 한마디도 못 끌어냈죠?
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:37	Maybe now you'll be able to
		move past this nonsense.
		이젠 그 억지 좀 그만 쓸 때도 됐죠?
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:40	Let me tell you something...
		I will catch you,
		한가지 분명히 합시다... 난 당신 잡을거요
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:43	sooner or later,
		그것도 조만간 
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:45	and I promise you that I will catch you.
		맹세컨대 당신 내가 잡을거요
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:48	Please.
		If you were capable of catching me,
		이봐요 당신이 그럴 재주가 있었다면 
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:51	you would have done so by now.
		진작에 그러셨겠죠
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:57	Good-bye, Patrick.
		잘 있어요, 패트릭 
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:59	Jane. Jane, we gotta go.
		제인, 빨리 일어나
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	I just got a call from
		S.F.P.D. Peter's dead.
		경찰에서 전화왔어 피터가 죽었대 
00:37:04	 
		 
00:37:06	He killed himself.
		자살했대 
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:18	Sleeping pills.
		수면제 
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:20	Coroner found an empty
		bottle in the bathroom.
		검시관이 욕실에서 빈병을 발견했다는군요
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:23	So... sole accomplice in your crime
		그러니... 당신의 유일한 공범은 
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	just went and killed himself.
		여기 와서 스스로 목숨을 끊었군요
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:31	Fortunately, however,
		하지만 다행스럽게도 
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:33	Peter left a letter.
		피터는 유서를 남겼어요
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:40	And I'm betting it will tell
		us everything we need to know
		당신 남편이 죽던 날 무슨 일이 있었는지 
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:43	about the night your husband was murdered.
		여기 소상히 쓰여 있을거라는데 걸지요
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:46	You confess now,
		지금 자백해요
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	chances are the A.G.'s
		office is gonna cut you a deal.
		아직은 형량 거래가 가능할지 모르니까
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:57	Open it.
		열어요 난 당신 못 믿어 
00:37:57	 
		 
00:38:03	Be my guest.
		그러시겠다면야
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:13	Yes, it's a bluff.
		과연 속임수였군 
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:16	Honestly, I expected better from you.
		솔직히 이보단 한 수 위를 기대했는데 말이죠
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:19	Using poor Peter's suicide as a trap?
		가엾은 피터의 죽음을 함정으로 이용해? 
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:21	That's low, immoral, even.
		삼류, 게다가 비도덕적이기까지 
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:24	I tried to tell you. I always win.
		난 말야, 한번도 대결에서 져본적이 없다구
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	You might have gotten away with
		murder, but you didn't win.
		살인죄에선 벗어날 수 있을지 몰라도 당신은 이긴게 아냐 
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:30	How's that exactly?
		무슨 말이지? 
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:31	No matter what you say, I know the truth.
		당신이 뭐라고 하건간에 난 알 수 있다구 
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:34	You cared about Peter,
		당신은 피터를 아꼈어 
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:36	and it was your actions that
		drove him to kill himself.
		그리고 당신의 행동이 그를 자살로 내몰았지 
00:38:39	 
		 
00:38:39	That is something that you will live with
		이건 당신이 남은 평생 안고 살아갈 
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	for the rest of your life.
		짐이 될거야
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:44	I'll manage.
		내가 알아서 할 수 있어
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:46	No, you won't.
		It'll eat you up from the inside,
		안될걸 그건 당신 속에서부터 파먹어 들어갈거야
00:38:48	 
		 
00:38:49	because you cared way too much about him.
		당신은 그만큼 피터를 아꼈거든 
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:51	You're wrong. No, I'm right,
		당신 틀렸어 - 아니야, 실제 그래 
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:53	just like I'm right about
		the first time I saw you.
		당신을 처음 봤을때나 마찬가지로 
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	You are an open book to me.
		You're transparent, like glass.
		당신 속은 투명한 유리처럼 들여다보여
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	If you think for a moment I even
		remotely cared about Peter,
		당신한테 만약 한순간이라도 내가 간접적으로라도 피터를 신경쓰는 듯이 보였다면 
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	you're as gullible as he was.
		당신 역시 피터 만큼이나 순진한거야
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:05	Not just cared. You loved him.
		I know it. Can't you see?
		신경쓰는 정도가 아니라 그건 사랑이었어 나한텐 보여, 모르겠어? 
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	There's nothing you can hide from me.
		나한테서 뭐 하나 숨길 수 있을 것 같아?
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:08	You're a fool.
		바보로군 
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:09	And you're a terrible liar.
		당신은 형편없는 거짓말쟁이고 
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:11	You lost, Erica, not just some little game.
		당신 졌어, 에리카 대결에서 진게 문제가 아니라 
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	You lost someone you loved.
		I didn't love Peter.
		당신은 사랑하는 사람을 잃었다고 - 난 피터를 사랑하지 않았어 
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:16	I could care less about him.
		신경쓰는 것조차 귀찮았어
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	He meant nothing to me.
		놈은 나한테 아무것도 아니었어 
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:19	Perfect. That's exactly
		what I was hoping to hear,
		완벽해 바로 정확히 내가 듣고 싶었던 말이자, 
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	rather, that's exactly what I
		was hoping Peter would hear.
		바로 정확히 피터로 하여금 듣게 하고 싶었던 그 말이군 
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:24	Peter.
		피터
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:29	Peter.
		피터
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:33	Thank God you're here.
		오, 하느님 네가 여기 있다니 
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	Don't listen to a word they say.
		They're telling you lies.
		저 사람들 말은 믿지 마 다 거짓말이야 
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:38	You know how I feel about you, darling.
		내 마음 알잖아, 자기 
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:41	Peter. Peter!
		피터! 
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:43	Please! By the way, there
		was a body in that bag.
		피터 제발! - 그건 그렇고 저기 시체백 말이야
00:39:46	 
		 
00:39:47	It wasn't Peter's. No, of course not.
		그거 피터 아냐 물론 아니겠지 
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	That's kind of obvious.
		It was your husband's.
		이렇게 뻔한걸 당신 남편이었다고 
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:52	And I told you I would
		catch you, and I did.
		그리고 내가 당신 잡을거라 했었지 또 잡았고 
00:39:55	 
		 
00:39:58	Erica left ten minutes into the interview.
		에리카는 인터뷰 시작하고 십분 후에 나갔어요
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:02	She told me to wait
		behind with the recorder.
		나더러 녹음기를 가지고 기다리라 했죠
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:06	She said if I just played the questions,
		내가 질문만 틀고 있으면 된다고 했어요
00:40:09	 
		 
00:40:09	then no one would ever know she was gone.
		그럼 아무도 그녀가 나갔다 온지 모를거라고 
00:40:12	 
		 
00:40:15	She knew John was going down
		to the marina after work.
		에리카는 존이 퇴근하면 마리나로 내려간다는 걸 알았어요
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:19	That time of day,
		그 시각엔 
00:40:20	 
		 
00:40:20	there aren't a lot of
		people around, you know?
		거기 지나다니는 사람이 몇 없어요
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:24	She waited for him and...
		존을 기다리다 
00:40:25	 
		 
00:40:33	And you shot him.
		쏜 거지 
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:38	You shot your own husband in cold blood.
		자기 남편에게 망설임없이 방아쇠를 당겼어 
00:40:40	 
		 
00:40:42	Peter told us everything.
		피터가 모든 것을 얘기해줬어
00:40:43	 
		 
00:40:44	You used him as your accomplice
		because he was weak,
		피터가 나약하고 불안정했기 때문에 
00:40:47	 
		 
00:40:48	unstable.
		공범으로 써먹기 좋았겠지 
00:40:49	 
		 
00:40:49	You could manipulate him.
		But it backfired.
		조종할 수 있으니까 하지만 역풍이 분 셈이지 
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:52	He couldn't take the pressure,
		압박을 견디다 못해 
00:40:54	 
		 
00:40:54	and now he'll testify against you,
		이제 당신 상대로 반대증언을 하게 생겼으니 
00:40:55	 
		 
00:40:55	and you will spend a very
		long time in prison.
		그리고 당신은 감방에서 아주 오랜 시간을 보내겠지 
00:40:58	 
		 
00:40:59	Don't count on it.
		자신하기는 일러 
00:41:00	 
		 
00:41:02	It's over.
		끝났어
00:41:02	 
		 
00:41:04	A jury still has to believe him.
		배심원이 그 말을 믿어준다면 말이지 
00:41:06	 
		 
00:41:08	And he is, as you so
		accurately put it, unstable.
		피터는, 당신이 정확히 봤듯이, 불안정한 아이야
00:41:11	 
		 
00:41:12	Erica, it's over.
		끝났다고, 에리카
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:15	I'm sure of it.
		내가 장담하지
00:41:16	 
		 
00:41:17	Don't be.
		그러지 않는게 좋을걸 
00:41:18	 
		 
00:41:20	Not everyone's as smart as you.
		나머지 세상 사람들은 당신만큼 영리하지 못하거든 
00:41:22	 
		 
00:41:24	Jane?
		제인?
00:41:25	 
		 
00:41:27	You in here?
		있어?
00:41:28	 
		 
00:41:33	Ah, there's my computer.
		아, 내 노트북이 저기 있구만
00:41:34	 
		 
00:41:48	Uh, I'm looking for someone
		제가 바라는 사람은... 
00:41:49	 
		 
00:41:50	who, uh...
		음... 
00:41:51	 
		 
00:41:53	Someone... I can trust,
		제가 믿을 수 있는, 
00:41:56	 
		 
00:41:57	someone strong, someone...
		강한 
00:41:58	 
		 
00:42:00	At peace with themselves,
		어떤 일에도 흔들리지 않는 
00:42:01	 
		 
00:42:02	someone better than me,
		저보다 괜찮은 사람이라, 
00:42:03	 
		 
00:42:05	someone who knows the...
		제 가장 추한 면을 알면서도 
00:42:06	 
		 
00:42:08	Worst side of me and still loves me.
		절 계속 사랑해 줄 수 있는 사람이에요
00:42:10	 
		 
00:42:14	Sounds like an amazing woman.
		듣자니 정말 놀라운 분이겠는걸요
00:42:15	 
		 
00:42:18	She was.
		실제 그렇답니다
