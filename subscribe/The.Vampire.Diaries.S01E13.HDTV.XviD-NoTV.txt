00:00:00	Previously on "the vampire diaries..."
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	Stefan: For over a century
		I have lived in secret-
		한세기를 걸쳐
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:03	Until now. I know the risk,
		위험한 건 알지만
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	But I have to know her. Damon: Elena...
		그녀를 알아야 한다
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	She's a dead ringer for katherine.
		캐더린과 정말
		똑닮았더군
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	You have no idea of the
		future I have planned for us.
		내 계획이 어떤건지
		전혀 모를걸요
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	You, me, and damon.
		나와 당신과
		데이먼이 함께 말이죠
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	Our love for katherine
		wasn't real, damon.
		캐더린에 대한 우리의 사랑은
		진심이 아녔어
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	Katherine never compelled me.
		I knew everything.
		나한텐 주문을 건적 없어
		캐더린은 모든걸 알려줬지
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	It was real for me.
		나에겐 진심이었어
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	I'm going to bring her back.
		다시 부활시킬거야
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Tell me how to get into the tomb.
		묘지 안으로 들어갈
		방법을 알려줘
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	The grimoire. Where is it?
		- 주술책
		- 어디 있어?
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	Check the journal, jonathan gilbert's.
		일기장을 확인해봐
		조나단 길버트 일기장
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	Can I borrow your ancestor's journal?
		너희 조상의 일기장 좀
		빌려도 되니?
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	I gave it to my history teacher.
		역사선생님한테 드렸어
00:00:26	 
		 - 알라릭 살츠만입니다
		- 데이먼 이에요
00:00:26	Alaric saltzman. Damon.
		 - 알라릭 살츠만입니다
		- 데이먼 이에요
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	So the grimoire, thats emily's, right?
		주술책 말인데
		에밀리꺼 맞지?
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	That's what you need
		to reverse the spell?
		주문을 역행시키는데
		필요한 거야?
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	I'll help you. Ok.
		- 내가 도와줄게
		- 좋아
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	I told damon that I'd help
		him get katherine back.
		데이먼한테 캐더린을
		되살리게 도와준다고 했어
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	But it was a lie. I can't let him do it.
		거짓말이야
		그렇게 둘 수 없어
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	Then don't. And I'll help you.
		Whatever it takes.
		그럼 막아. 내가
		도와줄게. 무슨일이든
00:00:40

00:00:57	Please, help us!

00:00:59

00:01:03	Please help!
		제발 구해주세요!
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:06	What are you doing out her
		in the middle of the night?
		한밤중에 여기서
		뭐하고 계십니까
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	It's not safe.
		안전한 곳이 아니오
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:09	No. No, sir.
		네 맞아요
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:11	It's not safe.
		안전하지 않죠
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:26	[screaming]
		 
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:32	And that's how it's done.
		이렇게 끝내는 거야
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:37	What happens to the bodies?
		시체는?
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:39	Well, I'll take them into the woods
		숲속에 던져두면
00:01:41	 
		 
00:01:41	And the other animals
		will finish them off.
		다른 동물들이 처리 할거야
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:47	Are you sure you're ready for this?
		정말로 준비 됐어?
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:52	I'm ready.
		응
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	I want you to turn me.
		날 바꿔줘
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	When it's time.
		때가 되면
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:59	Kiss me.
		키스해줘
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:03	You should get a taste.
		한 번 맛을 봐
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:07	Sorry. Don't be.
		- 미안해
		- 그럴 필요 없어
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	Soon you won't be able to get enough.
		곧 끊임없이
		피를 갈망하게 될테니

00:02:38	Mmm, good morning.
		좋은 아침
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:42	I could get used to this.

00:02:45

00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	Damon! Please! What are you doing?
		- 데이먼! 제발!
		- 여긴 왜 들어왔어?
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	Oh, stop being smutty.
		음란한 짓 그만해
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:51	Seriously, get out of here!
		진짜 좀 나가줘!
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:53	If I see something I
		haven't seen before,
		못 봤던 걸
		처음으로 보게 되면
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54	I'll throw a dollar at it. Now listen,
		돈 줄테니까
		아무튼 들어봐
00:02:56	 
		 
00:02:56	We have some very important
		business to discuss.
		아주 중요한
		사업을 좀 논해야 해
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	And it has to be right now?
		꼭 지금 해야 돼?
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:00	Well, we have lots to do,
		now that we're all friends
		우리 할일이 많아
		모두 친구가 됐으니
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	And working toward a common goal.
		공통의 목표를 위해
		함께 일하는 거지
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	So, in order to open the tomb,
		무덤을 열기 위해선
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	We need to find the journal
		일기를 찾아야 해
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	To get the grimoire to open the spells.
		주문을 깰
		주술서를 얻어야하고
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	First things firs
		t- since you are elena gilbert,
		우선 처음으로
		넌 엘레나 길버트니
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	You're on journal duty.
		네가 일기장을
		찾아오도록 해
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	Since when am I helping?
		언제부터 내가 돕는댔죠?
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:16	Well, stefan's helping,
		and you've taken up residence
		스테판은 돕기로 했고
		또한 너 역시
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	In stefan's bed, ergo...
		우리집 침실을
		들락 거리니
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	You don't have to do anything
		you don't want to do.
		원치않으면
		안해도 돼
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:23	I'll look for it tonight. Good.
		- 내가 찾아올게
		- 다행이다
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	How do we know that this journal
		어떻게 이 일기장에
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:27	Will hold the location of the grimoire?
		주술책의 위치가
		적혀있는지 알아?
00:03:28	 
		 
00:03:28	We're really going to take
		the word of this vampire?
		정말 그 뱀파이어의
		말을 믿을 꺼야?
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	[indistit]
		 
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:32	In lieu of any other options.
		다른 방법 대신에
00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:34	, what exactly is a grimoire, anyway?
		주술책이 대체 뭔데요?
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	It's a witch's cookbook.
		마녀의 요리책과 같지
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	Every spell that a witch casts
		마녀가 거는 모든 마법은
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	Is unique into itself,
		그 하나하나가 독특해
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	So every witch would
		document their work.
		그래서 자신들의 주문을
		기록해 놓는 거지
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:43	Yeah. Cookbook.
		그래. 요리책처럼
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:45	What about our mystery vampire?
		미스터리한 뱀파이어는?
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	Dimwit obviously wasn't working alone,
		그 얼간이는 혼자서
		일하는 게 아닌게 확실하니
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	So whoever's out there knows who we are.
		누가 있든
		우리 존재를 아는거야
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	And I don't like that
		disadvantage, so...
		그런 난 약점이
		맘에 들지 않으니..
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	Chop, chop.
		빨리 서둘러
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	You know, I really like this whole menag
		e-threesome team thing.
		셋이 한 팀되서
		일하는 거 맘에 들어
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:01	It's got a bit of a kink to it.
		약간 변태스러운 면이 있거든
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	[chuckles]
		 
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	Don't screw it up.
		망치지 말거라
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:07	He does have-
		데이먼..
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	Oh, right, yeah.
		맞다
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:13	Ok.
		좋아
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	Oh! No, come here.
		이리 와
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:20	We shouldn't- shh.
		- 우린..
		- 쉿
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:32	What are you doing? Stop it!
		뭐하는거야!
		그만해!
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	Make me.
		날 바꿔줘
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:48	[knock on door]
		 
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	Yes?
		네?
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:54	Excuse me, miss katherine.
		실례합니다
		캐더린 양
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	Miss pearl is here to see you.
		펄 여사가
		뵈러 오셨어요
00:04:59	 
		 
00:04:59	I'll be down soon.
		곧 내려갈게
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	Please ask her to wait.
		기다리라고 해
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Thank you, emily.
		고마워, 에밀리
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:07	[katherine groans]
		 
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	Fun's over. Hmm, no.
		- 재미는 끝났네
		- 안돼
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	[chuckles]
		 
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:16	It's good to see you, pearl.
		만나서 반가워, 펄
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	Perhaps we could talk oside.
		밖에서 얘기하지
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	Emily, would you please
		tell Mr. Salvatore
		에밀리, 살바토어 군에게
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	That I've stepped away?
		외출한다고 전해줄래?
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	Which one?
		어느 분요?
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:31	Both.
		둘 다
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:36	How long do you plan on
		staying with the salvatores?
		살바토어가에서
		얼마나 머무를 계획이지?
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	People talk, katherine.
		사람들이 얘기해
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	You, carrying on with both brothers,
		두 형제와 함께 지내는 건
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	Doesn't help the situation.
		상황을 더 어렵게 만들지
00:05:46	 
		 
00:05:46	The salvatores have
		been kind to take me in.
		살바토어 형제들은
		친절하게도 날 받아줬어
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	As far as everyone here knows,
		모두들 알다시피
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	I'm a poor orphan girl from atlanta,
		난 애틀랜타 출신
		불쌍한 고아 소녀에
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Lost her family in the fires.
		가족들을 화재로 잃었지
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	A match you lit, no doubt.
		물론 네가
		불붙인 성냥이었겠지
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	[chuckles]
		 
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	Honey, please be careful.
		얘야, 조심하거라
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:03	Honorary fell came by
		the apothecary yesterday
		펠 의원님이 어제
		약방에 들르셨어
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	With a case of this elixir.
		이 특효약이 들은
		병을 가져오셨지
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	She asked that it be
		sold at a reduced rate.
		할인된 가격에
		팔라고 부탁하셨어
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	I don't follow. Try it.
		- 이해가 안돼
		- 한번 뿌려봐
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:19	[sizzling] [gasping]
		 
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	What in hell? Vervain.
		- 대체 뭐지?
		- 마편초야
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	Why is there-
		그게 왜?
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	[sighs] they know.
		그들도 알게된 거구나
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	They're trying to find us,
		and they're getting crafty about it.
		우리를 찾으려고 해
		아주 교활하게 말이지
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	The townspeople ingesting vervain?
		마편초를 먹는
		사람들이라
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	Ll, that's inconvenient.
		불편해지겠는걸
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	It might be time for
		us to move on again.
		다시 떠날 때가 된 것 같아
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	No. I like it here.
		아니. 난 여기가 좋은 걸
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	I'm not interested in leaving just yet.
		아직 떠나고 싶은
		마음이 없어
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	Can we go, mama?
		이제 가도 되요, 엄마?
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:45	Is something wrong?
		무슨 일 있어요?
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:47	Hey, it's me again.
		안녕, 또 나야
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	Anna. Soccer chick
		애나. 축구와
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	And foosball champion.
		당구 게임 챔피언
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	I'll be at the grill later, if you want,
		오늘 저녁에 그릴 갈건데
		너도 괜찮으면
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	You know, a rematch, or whatever.
		다시 한판 붙던가 하자
00:06:58	 
		 
00:07:00	Who are you calling?
		누구한테 전화한 거야?
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	Jeremy gilbert.
		제레미 길버트
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:04	You're not, like, into him, are you?
		너 걔 좋아하거나
		그런건 아니지?
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	I need him for something.Get over it.
		필요한 것 때문에 그래
		오버하지 마
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	Oh! Mmm!
		 
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	Damn it!
		젠장!
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:12	Dude, you gotta stop doing that.
		그 짓은 좀 그만해
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	I know. I just- I keep forgetting.
		알아. 자꾸 까먹어서
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	You're new.
		바뀐지 얼마 안됐으니
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	You'll get it.
		적응 될거야
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	You found the gilbert journal?
		길버트 일기장 찾았니?
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	Does that look like thgilbert journal?
		그거 길버트 일기장처럼 보이니?
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	Well, it's old and musty,
		낡고 곰팡내나는데
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	And how am I supposed
		to know the difference?
		차이점을 어떻게 알지?
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:28	I don't know,
		I figured maybe, just maybe,
		글쎄 어쩌면
		그러니까 어쩌면
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	You've been paying a little
		bit of attention since we met.
		우리가 만난 후로
		좀 관심을 가졌으면 알텐데
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	[scoffs] you know,
		you don't have to talk down to me.
		나한테 거만한 태도로
		말할 필요 없어
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	I'm not stupid.
		난 바보가 아니라고
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	Here.
		여기
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	Drink.
		마셔
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	I don't want you getting
		itchy around the witch.
		마녀 근처에서
		가렵거나 하면 안되잖아
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	She can sense if you're weak.
		네가 약해지면
		감지할거야
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:49	When can we go hunting again?
		사냥은 언제 가?
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	This tastes old. I want fresh blood.
		이거 오래된 것 같아
		신선한 피가 마시고 싶어
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	When we get that tomb open,
		그 무덤을 열면
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	You can kill anyone you want.
		넌 아무나 죽여도 돼
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	For now, just stay focused on bonnie
		아직까진
		보니에 집중해
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	While I try to get the journal
		back from jeremy's teacher.
		난 제레미 선생한테
		일기장 뺏어올테니
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:03	Why did you choose me?
		왜 날 택했어?
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	I needed someone in a position
		to be my eyes and ears.
		내 귀와 눈이 되줄
		사람을 찾고 있었어
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	Small town bartender fit the bill
		시골 바텐더는
		딱 들어맞지
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	There are plenty of
		bartenders tohoose from.
		고를 수 있는
		바텐더는 참 많은데
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	Why me?
		왜 날?
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	You were sad then.
		그때 넌 슬펐잖아
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	You lacked purpose.
		삶의 목적을 잃었었지
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	You needed me.
		내가 필요했어
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:23	Do you think damon really believes us?
		데이먼이 정말
		우릴 믿어줄까?
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	That we're both trying to help him?
		우리 모두가
		그를 도우려 한다고?
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:29	I don't think damon
		knows what to believe.
		데이먼은 뭘 믿어야할지 모를걸
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	Trust isn't something that
		comes naturally to him.
		신뢰를 쉽게 하지 못하거든
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	You know...
		있지..
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	I really think that damon believes
		내 생각에
		데이먼이 믿는 건
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	That everything he's done,
		every move that he's made,
		그가 저지른 모든 짓과
		그가 결정한 모든 행동이
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	He's done for love
		사랑을 위한 거라
		생각하는 것 같아
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:43	It's twisted, but kind of sad.
		뒤틀린 생각이지만
		정말 슬프기도 하지
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	There are other ways
		to get what you want.
		원하는걸 얻을
		다른 방법도 있어
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	You don't have to kill people.
		사람을 죽일 필요는 없잖아
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Damon has no regard for human life.
		데이먼은 인간의 목숨을
		존중할 줄 몰라
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	He enjoys inflicting pain on others.
		다른 사람들에게
		고통 주는 걸 즐기지
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	For 145 years,
		145년간
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:04	Every single time that I
		have let my guard down
		내가 방어를 풀고
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:08	And let damon back into my life,
		데이먼을 내 인생에
		들일 때마다
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	He's done something to
		make me regret that.
		그 선택을 후회하게
		만드는 짓을 했었어
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	I'm not going to make
		that mistake again.
		난 또다시 그런
		실수를 하지 않을거야
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	So what do you think will happen
		그럼 어떻게 될 것 같아?
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	If the tomb gets opened and
		damon gets katherine back?
		무덤이 열리고
		데이먼이 캐더린을 되찾으면?
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:21	I think that no matter
		what damon promises,
		데이먼이 약속하는게 뭐든지
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:23	A lot of people will die.
		많은 사람들이 죽게 될 거야
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:26	[exhales]
		 
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:33	That's jonathan gilbert.
		조나단 길버트야
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:40	What's this?
		이게 뭐지?
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:46	What are you guys doing?
		둘이 뭐하고 있어?
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	Hey. Just going through some stuff,
		그냥 물건을 뒤져보면서
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Feeling sentimental.
		감상에 젖었지
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	Dad had this whole family
		journal from years ago.
		아버지는 몇년 전부터
		조상들 일기장을 보관하셨잖아
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	I thought I'd dig it up.
		한번 열어볼까 싶었어
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	Jonathan gilbert's journal?
		조나단 길버트씨
		일기장 말이지?
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	Yeah, what do you know about it?
		너 아니?
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	I just did a history report on it.
		그걸로 역사 리포트 썼는걸
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	Oh. So where is it now?
		그럼 어디있어?
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	I gave it to mr. Saltzman.
		He wanted to see it.
		살츠만 선생님한테 줬어
		보고 싶으시대
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:07	I met barnett and giuseppe this evening.
		'오늘 저녁에
		바넷과 지세피를 만났다'
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	I saw the scepticism in their eyes
		when I showed them the compass.
		'나침반을 보여줄때
		그들의 눈에서 의심이 보였다'
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	We're supposed to believe
		that can track one of them?
		이걸로 추적할수 있다고
		믿으란 말인가?
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	What is it, magic?
		무슨 마법인가?
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	It's science.
		과학의 힘이죠
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	I'll believe it when I see it.
		직접 보여주면
		자네를 믿겠네
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	I've been thinking about this church ea.
		교회에 가두는 생각을 했는데
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	I believe it could work.
		효과가 있을 것 같네
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	Excuse me, father.
		실례해요, 아버지
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	I didn't know you had guests.
		손님들이 계신줄 몰랐네요
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	We'll be done in a few minutes, son.
		얘기는 곧 끝날거네
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	I'll come back. Forgive me, mr. Gilbert,
		가볼게요
		죄송합니다, 길버트씨
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	Mr. Lockwood.
		락우드씨
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:35	Have you told them?
		아드님께
		얘기하셨나요?
00:10:37	Have you told them?
		아직 못했네
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	Not yet.
		
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	Giuseppe, we need all
		the men we can get.
		지세피씨, 우린
		남자들을 총동원해야 합니다
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	I'll tell them.
		얘기하겠소
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	You can count on both my boys.
		우리 아이들은 반드시
		도울거요
00:10:44	 
		 
00:11:46	Hello?
		누구세요?
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:57	Hello?
		누구 있어요?
00:11:59	 
		 
00:12:04	Someone there?
		 
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:47	You shouldn't have done that.
		그러지 마셨어야지
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:53	Have a seat.
		앉아봐
00:12:55	 
		 
00:13:00	What is this, compressed air?
		압축 공기인가?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:03	Did you make it yourself?
		직접 만든 거야?
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	Who are you?
		정체가 뭐야?
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	I'm not going to hurt you...
		해하지 않을거야
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Unless you try that again.
		그런 짓만 안하면
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:21	Now...
		Now...
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:26	Who are you?
		당신 정체가 뭐야?
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	I'm a teacher.
		선생님이지
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:32	Are we going to have to
		do this the hard way?
		어렵게 만들고 싶어?
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	I'm also a historian.
		난 역사가이기도 해
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	And while researching virginia, I-
		그리고 버지니아주를
		조사하다가..
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	Made a few discoveries about your town.
		이 동네에 대해
		몇가지 발견했지
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	So you show up like van helsing.
		그래서 반 헬싱처럼
		나타나셨다
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	Come on.
		왜 이러셔
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Tell me the truth.
		사실을 말해줘
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	My wife was a parapsychologist.
		내 아내는
		초(超)심리학자였어
		(정신 감응·천리안 따위의
		초자연적 심리 현상을 다룸)
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	She spent her life researching
		paranormal activity in this area.
		평생 이 지역의
		비과학적 행동들을 조사했지
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	It was her work that led me here.
		날 여기로 이끈건
		그녀의 일 때문이었어
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	Where's your wife?
		아내는 어딨는데?
00:13:59	 
		 
00:13:59	Dead.
		죽었어
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	A vampire killed her.
		뱀파이어가 죽였지
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Where's the gilbert journal?
		길버트 일기장은?
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	What do you want with it? Where is it?
		- 그걸로 뭘하게?
		- 어디 있어?
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	It's on my desk. No, it's not.
		- 내 책상에
		- 없잖아
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:13	It was on my desk.
		책상에 있었는데
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:19	Anything?
		아무 것도 못찾았어?
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:20	Not yet. Just a lot of gibberish.
		아직은
		알수없이 지껄여놨네
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	Yeah, some people just
		shouldn't journal.
		일기 쓰면 안돼는
		사람들이 있다니까
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	I thought this gilbert was the brains.
		길버트란 사람
		똑똑한 줄 알았는데
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	[sighs] don't you have a date?
		데이트 있지 않아?
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	Yep.
		맞다
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	Wish me luck.
		행운을 빌어줘
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:34	Ehh.
		 
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:37	I saw her again today-
		'오늘 또다시 그녀를 봤다'
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	The most beautiful woman in town,
		'미스틱 폴즈에서
		가장 아름다운 여성'
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	With a name just as pretty, pearl.
		'이름도 얼굴만큼 예쁜 '펄''
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	Have you thought any
		more of what I've said?
		내가 얘기한 건
		생각 안했어?
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	We'll leave soon, pearl, I promise.
		곧 떠날거야
		약속해
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	I need to take care
		of a few things first.
		우선 먼저 처리할
		일이 있어
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:51	You're going to turn
		both of them, aren't you?
		둘 다 뱀파이어로
		만드려는 거구나?
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:55	Katherine, please.
		캐더린, 제발
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	Be careful.
		조심해
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	We'll all be safe, I promise.
		우리 다 안전할거야
		약속해
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	Mr. Gilbert's coming.
		길버트 씨가 오시네
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	Quick, your cheeks.
		볼 빨리 봐줄게
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Perfectly rosie.
		완벽한 장밋빛이 됐네
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	Miss pearl.
		펄 양
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	May I have a moment?
		잠시 얘기 좀 할 수 있을까요?
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	Yes Mr. Gilbert.
		네, 길버트씨
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	I'm still waiting for you
		아직도 전
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	To explain that comet in the sky.
		하늘의 혜성에 대해
		설명해주시길 기다렸답니다
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:21	Your mother has an admirer.
		너희 어머니한테
		구애자가 생겼네
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:26	As descendants of the founding families,
		설립 가족들의
		자손으로써
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	They'll want to know that
		they can count on you.
		너희들을 믿을 수 있나
		알고 싶을거다
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	Of course they can.
		물론 믿으셔도 됩니다
		의심하는 분들이 있나요?
00:15:30	 
		물론 믿으셔도 됩니다
		의심하는 분들이 있나요?
00:15:30	Is there any doubt?
		물론 믿으셔도 됩니다
		의심하는 분들이 있나요?
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	I'm not sure your brother damon
		네 형 데이먼이
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	Understands the importance of duty.
		이 임무의 중요성을
		이해하는지 모르겠구나
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	Damon left the confederacy on principle.
		데이먼은 남부 연방을
		원칙에 따라 떠났어요
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	It was his choice
		그의 선택이니
		존중받아야 합니다
00:15:43	 
		그의 선택이니
		존중받아야 합니다
00:15:43	And should be respected.
		그의 선택이니
		존중받아야 합니다
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	You'll forgive me if I have
		trouble respecting a deserter.
		탈영군을 존중하지
		못해서 미안하구나
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	Well, I never asked for your respect.
		아버지의 존중을
		부탁한 적 없어요
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	Good for you, damon.
		잘했다, 데이먼
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Because all I have is disappointment.
		너한텐 늘 실망 뿐이니
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:56	You said the town is in trouble?
		이 동네가
		위험에 빠졌다구요?
00:15:59	 
		 
00:16:00	There's been too many deaths.
		많은 사람들이 죽었어
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	It is time for us to fight back
		살인마들에 맞써
		그들을 죽일 때다
00:16:05	 
		살인마들에 맞써
		그들을 죽일 때다
00:16:05	And stop these killers.
		살인마들에 맞써
		그들을 죽일 때다
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	Killers? What are you talking about?
		살인마라니
		무슨 소리시죠?
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	We live amongst demons.
		악마들 사이에서
		살고 있었어
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	You're being cryptic now, father.
		비밀스럽게 말씀 하시네요
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	Why don't you just say the word?
		그냥 말씀하시지 그러세요?
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	Vampires.
		뱀파이어 말이다
00:16:15	They exist.
		실제로 존재해
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	And they live amongst us.
		우리들 사이에
		살아가고 있었다
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	But we have a plan to kill them.
		그 놈들을 죽일
		계획을 마련했어
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:23	And you're going to help us.
		너희가 도와줘야 한다
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:29	My father never approved
		of anyone I dated,
		아버지는 제가 사귀는 여자는
		다 인정해주지 않으셨죠
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	Which only made me want them more.
		그래서 더 원하게 됐구요
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	Of course.
		Of course.
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	What about you?
		그쪽은요?
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	There were a few guys.
		남자가 몇 있었죠
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	Logan isn't the only loser I've dated.
		제가 사귄 낙오자는
		로건 뿐이 아녜요
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	They ever find him?
		Or is he still missing?
		로건을 찾았나요?
		아직도 실종 상태인가요?
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	He's not missing.
		실종된 게 아녜요
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	He's in the bahamas working on his tan.
		태닝하러
		바하마섬에 갔어요
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	Very entitled, that one.
		아주 자칭을 했죠
		혼자서 북치고 장구친거죠
00:16:50	 
		아주 자칭을 했죠
		혼자서 북치고 장구친거죠
00:16:50	Marches to his own drum.

00:16:53	he's a foul.
		재수 없는 놈이죠
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	They're all snooty.
		다들 무뚝뚝했어요
00:16:57

00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	Hello, elena.
		안녕, 엘레나
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:06	Hey. Where have you been?
		어디 있었어?
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	We're cooking dinner.
		저녁 만드는 중이야
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	Is stefan with you?
		스테판도 왔니?
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	He'll be here soon.
		곧 올거에요
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:15	How long have you been aware of me?
		언제부터 내 정체를 알고 있었지?
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	I learned just recently.
		최근에 알았어
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	What about your brother?
		우리 형은?
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	You met damon.
		데이먼을 만났죠
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	Who do you think killed my wife?
		내 아내를 죽인게
		누구 같아?
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:28	Are you certain it was damon?
		데이먼이 확실해?
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	I witnessed it.
		직접 목격했어
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	If you're here for revenge,
		복수를 위해 온거면
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	This is going to end very badly for you.
		정말 안좋게 끝날거야
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	I just want to find out
		what happened to my wife.
		아내한테 무슨 일이
		생겼던 건지 알고 싶을 뿐야
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	I thought you just said that damon-
		방금 데이먼이..
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	Yeah.
		그래
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	[exhales] I saw him
		직접 봤어
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	Draining the life out of her.
		피를 모두 빨아
		죽이는 모습을
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	He must have heard me coming.
		내가 오는 소리를 들었나봐
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	He just...Disappeared.
		바로.. 사라졌지
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	So did her body.
		그녀의 시체도
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	They never found her
		아무도 찾지 못했어
00:17:59	 
		 
00:18:00	[sighs]
		 
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:04	Damon can never know why you're here.
		데이먼은 당신이 온
		이유를 절대 몰라
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:08	He'll kill you without blinking.
		눈 깜빡 안하고
		당신을 죽일거야
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	I can take care of myself
		나 스스로 감당할 수 있어
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	[scoffs] no, you can't.
		아니, 못해
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	I can help you
		내가 도울게
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	If you let me.
		당신만 원한다면
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:25	Whoa. Mmm.
		 
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	[chuckles] don't do that.
		그러지 마요
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	Do what?
		뭘?
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	You know what. That move was deliberate.
		의도적으로 그랬잖아요
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	Well, yeah, I was deliberately trying
		그래, 나는 의도적으로
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	To get to the sink.
		싱크대 가려고 그랬지
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	[scoffs] speaking of stefan,
		스테판 얘기가
		나와서 말인데
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	Where is he?
		어디 있니?
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	He's missing family night,
		가족들의 저녁식사를 놓쳤네
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	Which I am enjoying immensely.
		난 정말 무한대로
		즐거운데 말이야
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:48	Is it real?
		진짜야?
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	Is what real?
		뭐가요?
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	This renewed sense of brotherhood.
		다시 부활한
		형재애 말이지
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:56	Can I trust him?
		그를 믿어도 되냐고?
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	Yes, you can trust him.
		물론이죠
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:09	Can I trust him?
		정말 스테판을
		믿어도 돼?
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	I'm wearing vervain, damon.
		It's not going to work.
		난 마편초를 차고 있어요
		효과 없을 거에요
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	I'm not compelling you.
		주문을 건게 아냐
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	I just want you to answer me.
		그냥 답해줘
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Honestly.
		정직하게
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:26	Of course you can.
		물론 믿으셔도 되요
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:33	Katherine: You can trust me,
		mr. Salvatore.
		날 믿어도 되요
		살바토어씨
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	I would never cheat.
		절대 반칙하지 않으니깐요
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:39	[sighs]
		 
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:42	I'm losing or here.
		내가 지고 있다
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	Again!
		또 말이야
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	She's good.
		잘하네
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	I almost believe she
		genuinely likes him.
		진짜 우리 아버지를
		좋아하나봐
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	Perhaps she does. [sffs]
		그럴지도 모르지
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	She knows father would have her
		killed if he knew the truth.
		사실을 알면
		이미 죽였을걸 알걸
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:58	Not if we talk to him;
		얘기하는게 어때
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	Explained how we feel.
		우리의 감정을
		말씀 드리자
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	He could help us keep her safe.
		안전하게 대피시킬 곳을
		찾아 주실거야
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	Have you gone mad?
		제 정신이야?
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	No, no, father would drive
		the stake in her himself!
		캐더린을
		직접 찔러 죽이실걸!
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	That's not true. We can trust him.
		아니야
		아버지를 믿어
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	No, no, not with this.
		아니, 이번은 안돼
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	Please, promise me you
		won't tell him, stefan.
		제발 말 안하겠다 약속해, 스테판
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:20	I promise.
		약속할게
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:26	Damon: There was a time when I
		trusted him more than anyone.
		그를 누구보다 믿었던 때가 있었지
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	Trust breeds trust.
		믿음은 믿음을 낳죠
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	You have to give it get it.
		믿음을 얻기 위해선
		먼저 믿어야 해요
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	Are you lecturing me?
		나한테 가르치는 거니?
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	Do you need to be lectured?
		가르침 받고 싶어요?
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	I just want her back.
		그저 캐더린을
		되찾고 싶을 뿐야
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	I'm sure you can understand that.
		물론 너도 이해하겠지
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	I can understand that you would
		do anything for her, yes.
		그러기 위해
		뭐든지 할거란것도 이해해요
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:49	Then you understand what I will do
		그럼 날 방해하면
		어떻게 될지도 알겠네
00:20:52	 
		그럼 날 방해하면
		어떻게 될지도 알겠네
00:20:52	If anyone gets in my way.
		그럼 날 방해하면
		어떻게 될지도 알겠네
00:20:54	 
		 
00:21:02	You said you never
		played this thing before.
		이거 한번도
		안해보셨다면서요
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	I'm a fast learner. Quick reflexes.
		난 빨리 익혀
		반사능력이 빨라서
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	[cell phone rings]
		 
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:12	Who are you dodging?
		누구길래 넘기는 거야?
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	This girl anna.
		애나란 여자애요
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:16	She can be, uh, persistent.
		좀 고집이 세거든요
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	Is she hot?
		예쁘니?
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Yeahyeah, but she can be weird.
		네 하지만
		좀 이상해요
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	Hot trumps weird, trust me.
		예쁘면 괜찮아
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	[whispering] he is ridiculously hot!
		정말 섹시하다!
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	Shh!
		조용해
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	He's an ass.
		정말 재수 없거든
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:35	What are you doing with all this stuff?
		이걸로 다 뭐하려고?
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	I thought there might be something
		뭔가 특별할 것 같았어
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	About my birth parents.
		내 친부모님들을
		알게될 거라고
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	Have you told jeremy?
		제레미한테 얘기했니?
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	I will.
		할거야
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	When the time is right.
		타이밍만 괜찮으면

00:21:48	[doorbell rings] that's stefan.
		스테판이다

00:22:01	Admit it.
		인정해
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	I can't sing.
		난 노래 못해
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	No. You were great.
		아뇨. 잘 부르던데
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	Come on, totally trashed

00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	Well, first mistake, metallica karaoke?
		메탈리카 노래로 한
		첫번째 실수
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	Well, at least I could admit it.
		최소한 인정했잖아
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:14	The woman with the tattoos loved you.
		문신한 여자분이
		맘에 들어 하던데요
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Yeah, well, next time,
		다음 번엔
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	I'm going to throw out my pearl jam.
		펄잼 노래로
		인상을 남겨줄게
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	Next time?
		다음에요?
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:20	Yeah.
		그래
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	So, uh,
		그럼

00:22:24	What are your friends up to tonight?
		네 친구들은 뭐한데?
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	They're all doing their own thing.
		각자 약속이 있어서요
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	Caroline's at her dad's,
		elena's with her boyfriend.

		단짝 친구에요
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	Yeah, my friends, they all
		moved away after graduation,
		그래. 내 친구들은
		졸업후 다 이사갔는데
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	And I didn't.
		난 안갔어
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:40	So we just kind of drifted apart.
		그래서 점점 멀어졌지
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	Oh. Elena and I are bonded for life.
		엘레나랑 전 평생을
		함께할 친구에요
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	I can't imagine it either way.
		달리 생각할 수 없죠
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	That tight, huh?
		그렇게 끈끈해?
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	She's my sister.
		I mean, I'd die for her.
		자매같아요
		걜 위해 죽을수도 있어요
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Huh.

		이거 알아
		그 선생이 가져간거야
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	There's something really off about him.
		뭔가 느낌이 이상했어
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:00	No, he doesn't know anything.
		아니, 아무것도 모르더라
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	Somebody got to him ght before me.
		내가 가기 전에

00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	Who else knew it was there?
		일기장의 위치를 아는건
		또 누가 있지?
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:08	No. Damon, leavhim out of it!
		안돼요, 데이먼
		제레미는 내버려둬요
00:23:10

00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	Don't ask questions, just spill.
		질문하지 말지
		그냥 불어
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:22	[chuckles] u're kidding me, right?
		농담하는 거죠?
00:23:24

00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	Just that girl anna. The hot weird one?

00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:33	Yeah. Wait, who is anna?

00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:08	I have concerns about your

00:27:33	 
		 
00:27:33	You always taught us so differently.

00:28:33	I was wondering how long it

		날 찾는데 얼마나 걸릴지 궁금했어
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:38	Elena: Why isn't your father

		왜 너희 아버지는

		여기 살아. 너도 그렇고
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	I don't want that tomb

00:29:43	Just as he wants me,
		그가 날 원하는 것 처럼

00:29:46	But I'm the one who gets
		to make all the rules.
		하지만 규칙을 정하는건
		바로 나 뿐야
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:49	And why is that?
		그건 왜지?
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	Because I'm spoiled.
		버릇 없으니까
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:51	Yes, you are.
		그래, 맞아
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:53	And selfish. Mmm.
		이기적이기도 하고

00:29:56	And because I can do this.
		난 이렇게 할 수 있으니까
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	Ahh.
		 
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	And this.

00:30:20	What?
		왜 그래?
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	[choking] what?
		왜 그러냐고?
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	Vervain.

00:30:38	Do as I say, son!
		내 말대로 하거라

00:30:40	Nothing that you feel for her is real.
		네 감정은 하나도
		진심이 아냐
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	She's a vampire, stefan! A monster!
		뱀파이어라고!
		그녀는 괴물이야!
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	I fed you vervain hoping
		that it would expose her.

00:30:47	How did you know?
		어떻게 아셨죠?
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	Your sympathy for their plight.
		그들이 궁지에 처하자
		동정심을 보였지
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	I didn't raise my sons to be so weak.
		난 내 아들을
		그렇게 약하게 키우지 않았다
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	The sheriff, now. Go, quickly!
		보안관을 불러
		어서!
00:30:58	 
		 
00:30:58	Now, son!
		빨리 가거라!
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:13	How long have you been here?
		여기 얼마나 있었니?
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	I arrived around half-past comet,
		혜성이 반쯤 지날때 도착했어
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	Watching you screw up every
		chance you had to open that tomb.
		오빠가 무덤을 열수 있는
		모든 기회를 망치는걸 봤지
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:20	How did you know about the spell?
		주문에 대해선
		어떻게 알았어?
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	I didn't say much back then,
		그 때 난 말을 별로 안했지
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	Which means I heard everything.
		그 말은 내가
		모든걸 다 들었단 뜻이야
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:26	So if you've been here the whole time,
		여태껏 우리를 듣고 있었다면
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	Then why are we just
		crossing paths right now?
		이제서야 방해하는 거야?
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:30	I like to use others
		to do my dirty work.
		난 힘든 일은
		남이 해주는게 좋거든
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:34	Like logan fell?
		로건 펠처럼?
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	Oh, yeah, thanks for that, by the way.
		그래, 그거 고마워
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	Little bastard shot me.
		그 놈이 날 쐈지
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	Logan was an idiot. Mm-hmm.
		로건은 멍청이였어
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	We slipped him some blood
		when he started getting
		피를 좀 먹였더니
		갑자기
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:45	All poser slayer with that comps.
		나침반 가지고
		사냥꾼 행세를 하더라
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	I needed his family's journal.
		I couldn't let him die.
		그의 조상 일기장이 필요했어
		그냥 죽게 둘 순 없었지
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	What'd you want with the fell journal?
		왜 펠의 일기장이 필요한데?
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	I thought it contained the location
		난 그 일기장에
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	Of the witch's spell book.
		마녀 주술책 위치가
		써있을줄 알았지
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	I was wrong.
		잘못 알았던 거야
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:55	According to her journal,
		honorea gave the grimoire

		뭐야?
00:33:34	 
		 
00:33:34	Not many girls can say

00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:49	This is an interesting turn of events.
		정말 놀라운 반전인데

00:34:54	I can't let you bring her back.

00:34:55	I'm sorry.
		미안

00:34:57	So am I.
		나도 미안해
00:34:58	 
		 
00:35:00	For thinking for even a second
		잠깐동안 널 믿어도 된다고
		생각했던 게

00:35:02	Oh. You're not capable of trust.
		 
00:35:04	Oh. You're not capable of trust.
		형은 믿을 능력이 안되잖아
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	The fact that you're here means
		that you read the journal
		사실 형이 여기 있단 건
		일기장을 읽었고
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:08	And you were planning
		on doing this yourself.
		직접 찾아내려고
		계획했단 뜻이지
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	Of course I was going
		to do it by myself,
		물론 나 혼자
		찾아내려고 했었지
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	Because the only one
		I can count on is me!
		내가 믿을 수 있는
		유일한 사람은 나 뿐이니까!
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	You made sure of that
		many years ago, stefan.
		오래 전에 나한테도
		그걸 확신시켜 줬지, 스테판
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:21	But you...
		하지만 넌..
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:25	You had me fooled.
		날 속였어
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:38	So what are you going to do now?
		이제 어쩌려고?
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	Because if you try and destroy that,
		그걸 파괴하려고 한다면
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	I'll rip her heart out.
		엘레나 심장을
		도려낼 거야
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:43	You won't kill her.
		형은 엘레나를
		죽이지 않을거야
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:50	I can do one better.
		더 좋은 방법이 있지

		그거 내놔, 스테판
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	Or I'm stabbing her neck.
		아니면 목을 꺾는다
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	And you and I will have
		a vampire girlfriend.
		그럼 너랑 나한테
		뱀파이어 여친이 생기는거야
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:02	Let her go first.
		먼저 놔줘
00:36:04	 
		 
00:36:05	Drop it.
		 
00:36:06	Drop it.
		일기장 내려놔
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:07	I'm not going to give this to you
		엘레나가 내 옆에 오기 전까진
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	Until she is standing next to me.
		이걸 주지 않을 거야
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:11	Problem is, I no longer trust
		문제가 뭐냐면 네가
		돌려줄거라 믿지 못한단 거야
00:36:12	 
		문제가 뭐냐면 네가
		돌려줄거라 믿지 못한단 거야
00:36:12	That you'll give it back!
		문제가 뭐냐면 네가
		돌려줄거라 믿지 못한단 거야
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	You just did the one thing
		that ensures that I will.
		방금 형은 내가
		돌려주게 만들었는걸

00:37:18	Stop! No don't take her!
		안돼요!
		그녀를 놔줘요!
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:19	Do you know what they'll do to you
		네가 저것들을 동정했단걸 알면
		널 어떻게 할지 알고 그러냐?
00:37:21	 
		네가 저것들을 동정했단걸 알면
		널 어떻게 할지 알고 그러냐?
00:37:21	If you're branded a sympathizer?
		네가 저것들을 동정했단걸 알면
		널 어떻게 할지 알고 그러냐?
00:37:23	 
		 
		 
00:37:23	You'll be killed along with them!
		너도 같이 죽일거야
00:37:26	 
		너도 같이 죽일거야

00:37:43	Oh, you'll be fine. That was just
		괜찮을거야
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	A small amount of blood.
		피 소량을 마셨거든
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	It should pass out of

		내일쯤 네 몸 밖으로 배출될거야
00:37:49	 
		 
00:37:52	Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:37:53	 
		 
00:37:55	Damon was right. This is, uh...
		데이먼이 맞았어
00:37:58	 
		 
00:37:58	This is my fault.

		되찾을거야
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	Don't you think you've done enough?
		이제 족하다고
		생각치 않니?
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:16	You promised you wouldn't tell him!
		말 안한다고 약속했잖아!
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	I didn't think this would happen.
		이런 일이 생길줄 몰랐어
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:28	You did this.
		니가 이런거야
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:31	This is your fault.
		다 네 잘못이야
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:35	I put my faith in my father,
		난 아버지를 믿었어
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	But damon put his faith in me,
		데이먼은 날 믿었고
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	And I destroyed that.
		내가 그 믿음을 파멸시켰지

00:38:45	This is my fault.
		내 잘못이야
00:38:46
