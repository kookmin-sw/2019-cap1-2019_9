00:00:18	Where have you been?
		어디 가 있었어?
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Hunting and gathering.
		소소하게 사냥, 채집.
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Ah. The victim's name
		is Timothy Hartley.
		이름은 티모시 하틀리
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	He was killed sometime last night.
		어젯밤 살해당했고 시각 불명
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	He was shot in the chest, and then
		his throat was slit. Charming.
		가슴에 총상, 그리고 목이 베였어 -근사하기도 하지
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	His I.D. says he's from
		about a hundred miles away
		신분증 보니까 주소가
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	from here... Hillsborough.
		여기서 수백마일은 떨어진 힐스보로던데
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	No sign of what he was doing up here.
		여기서 대체 뭘 하고 있었는지 모르겠어
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:33	Sheriff says Hartley's
		car's down the road.
		보안관이 아래서 하틀리 차를 발견했습니다
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	I'll check it out. All right.
		내가 가서 볼게
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:36	You tell him? Tell him what?
		인사는 했습니까? -무슨 인사?
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:38	Coroner's office sent Steiner.
		Dr. Steiner?
		스타이너 박사가 현장에 있어요 -스타이너?
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	And we all know how much you
		like to make fun of Dr. Steiner,
		스타이너 박사만 보면 입이 근질거려 죽겠지?
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	So don't, okay?
		그러니까 절대 하지마 알았어?
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:46	I don't know what
		you're talking about.
		무슨 말씀을 하시는건지 통
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	No humoring yourself at his expense.
		Is he that way?
		불쌍한 사람 놀잇감 삼지 말란 말이야
		-저쪽에 계신가?
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:51	Top of the morning to you, Steiner.
		좋은 아침입니다, 스타이너 박사
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:55	You're looking trim.
		신수가 훤하십니다
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	Jane.
		왔소
00:00:58	 
		 
00:01:01	Curiously considerate killer.
		범인이 이상하게 배려심이 있네요
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	Slit his throat after the shots
		to put him out of his misery.
		쏜 다음에 목을 갈라 고통을 줄여줬군요
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	Three steps back, please.
		세걸음 밖으로 물러나시오
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:09	What?
		네?
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:11	Please maintain a distance
		시체와 세걸음 거리를 유지하란 말이오
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:12	Of at least three steps
		from the body. Why?
		왜요?
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	Because this body is a no-Jane zone.
		왜냐면 이 시신은 제인 접근금지 대상이거든
00:01:18	 
		 
00:01:18	It will not be a playground for you.
		당신 장난감이 아니란 말이오
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:20	You will not touch it or sniff
		it or place playing cards on it
		만지거나 냄새 맡거나 그 위에서 카드마술을 하거나
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	Or borrow it for an interrogation.
		용의자 겁박을 위해 슬쩍해서도 안되오
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:25	If you do, a deputy will remove you.
		Clear?
		시도했다간 경관이 손봐줄거요 알겠소?
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:31	That's a little harsh, no?
		좀 많이 까칠해지셨습니다
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:33	You have driven me to
		desperate measures.
		날 이렇게까지 하게 만든것도 그쪽이오
00:01:36	 
		 
00:01:36	Well, I'm nothing
		if I'm not respectful
		함께 정의를 수호하는 입장에서
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	Of my fellow crime-fighters.
		항상 예의를 다하고자 하는 저입니다만
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	But I can see everything I
		need to from here anyway.
		아무튼 여기서 볼 건 다 봤네요
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:43	Really? W...
		정말이요? 뭐..
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:45	What exactly do you see?
		대체 뭘 봤단 거요?
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:48	He's in money, but not a banker,
		돈이 많은 사람이지만 은행가는 아니고,
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	Something more aggressive...
		stocks or such, social drinker,
		그보다 좀더 악착같은 주식이나 그런, 술은 업무상으로만 하는 편인데
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	Increased his intake lately,
		최근 많이 마시게 된 걸로 봐서
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	So under some pressure.
		마음이 쓰이는 일이 있었네요
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	A registered, uh, independent,
		though always votes republican,
		주관이 뚜렷하지만 거의 공화당을 찍을테고
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:00	And as much money as he
		has, his wife has more.
		마누라가 거의 이 사람만큼이거나 더 돈이 많거나 할겁니다
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:04	Ridiculous. He chose the
		tasteless tasseled loafers.
		말도 안돼 -시시하고 평범한 구두 취향으로 봐서
00:02:07	 
		 
00:02:07	She bought the opal-enlaced
		sterling silver cuff links.
		이 근사한 은제 커프스는 마누라 취향이겠군요
00:02:11	 
		 
00:02:11	Guesses.
		다 추측이잖아
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:13	You might as well say he's going
		to meet a tall, dark stranger.
		아예 수상한 낯선사람과 만날 작정이었다고 하시지?
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	That's very unlikely, doctor.
		그럴 확률은 적습니다
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:18	He's dead.
		이 사람 이미 죽었잖아요
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:20	And by the way, it looks
		like there's something
		그건 그렇고 이 사람 왼쪽 바지주머니에
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:22	In his left-front pant pocket.
		뭔가 들어있는 것 같은데요
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:32	You are about to think,
		"What the hell"? "How did Jane..."
		곧 이렇게 생각하시게 될 겁니다 '이런 빌어먹을'
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:36	"Do that?"
		'제인이 대체 언제 이런 짓을?'
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:41	How did you do that?
		이거 대체 어떻게 한거요
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:44	"There are more things in
		heaven and earth, Horatio,
		네 작은 머리로 생각할 수 있는 것보다
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	"Than dreamt of in your philosophy."
		하늘과 땅은 훨씬 많은 비밀을 감추게 마련이지, 호라시오
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:54	Okay. You planned ahead.
		미리 계획해 둔거지?
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:55	You asked one of the sheriff's
		deputies to call you
		스타이너가 현장에 배정되면
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	The next time Steiner was on a case
		미리 알려달라고 보안관에게 부탁하곤
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	And then you asked
		them to plant the note.
		보안관 시켜 쪽지를 넣어둔거야
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	That is an absurd theory.
		너무 억지스러워
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	You know this means another
		apology at the coroner's office.
		그리고 검시소 측에 사과해야 한다는거 알지
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	No, it doesn't.
		에이, 아니야 -사과해
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	Steiner loves the attention. Lisbon.
		스타이너는 관심주면 좋아해, 리스본
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:11	What happened?
		무슨 일입니까?
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	Where are they?
		그래서 어디요?
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:19	Robbery. Two guys in a pickup
		pulled the coroner's van over
		강도입니다 남자 둘이 검시소측 밴을 세우게 하고
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	And held it up. What'd they steal?
		털어갔어요 -훔쳐간게 뭡니까?
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:23	Huh. Get this... your vic's body.
		Hartley's corpse?
		피해자 시신이요 -하틀리 시신이요?
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	That's right.
		Steiner tried to stop them,
		그렇습니다 정말 의외지만 스타이너 박사가
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:27	believe it or not.
		Dr. Steiner.
		강도들이랑 실갱이를 벌였다는군요 -박사님
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:30	Agent Lisbon.
		리스본 요원
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:32	It's not as bad as it looks.
		보는 것만큼 심하지는 않다오
00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:34	Go get yourself checked out
		and then come talk to us.
		구조요원에게 일단 보이시고 다음에 말씀하세요
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	Jane, was this you?
		당신이오?
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	W... another trick?
		또 무슨 트릭 같은거요?
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	Oh. Jane had nothing to do
		with this, nothing at all.
		제인은 여기 아무 짓도 안했습니다 아무 짓도요
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:46	You didn't, did you?
		Of course not.
		너 안한거 맞지 -물론이지
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:48	Swear on your life?
		On your life, even.
		니 인생 걸고 맹세할거야? -니것까지 걸게
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	Damn it. Who steals a body?
		이런 옘병할 누가 그딴걸 가져간거야?
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:53	Interesting.
		재밌게 됐지?

00:04:07	The pickup was... pulled over.
		픽업트럭이 가다 섰지
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	There were two men, apparently
		working on the engine.
		두 남자가 엔진을 손보는 것 같았소
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:13	They flagged us down,
		우리더러 손짓해 세우더군
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	For help, we thought, and
		then they pulled out guns.
		도와달라는 줄 알았는데 그자들이 총을 꺼냈소
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	Can you describe them?
		인상착의는 기억나십니까?
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	They were both white,
		둘다 백인이고
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	A little under 6 feet, I think.
		6피트 조금 못 미치는 키에
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	I can't really say much more.
		그닥 말할게 없구려
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	They wore hooded s...
		jackets and sunglasses.
		후드를 쓰고 선글라스를 끼고 있었거든
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	One went to the van and
		dragged the body bag out.
		한 사람이 밴으로 와서 시체백을 꺼내갔소
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:33	The one guarding us went
		to help him, and...
		우릴 감시하던 자가 도와주러 가길래..
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:36	That's when I...
		그때 내가
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	Intervened.
		끼어들려 했지
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Foolish.
		그 무슨 바보같은
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	For once, I agree with you. Mnh.
		이번만은 동의하오
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:43	They put the body into the
		truck and they... they took off.
		시체백을 트럭에 싣더니... 떠나갔소
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Why would anyone do this?
		We don't know yet. It's early.
		대체 누가 그런 짓을 한단 말이오?
		- 저희도 아직은 모르겠습니다
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:51	I have to take this. I'm sorry.
		이건 받아야겠군요 실례합니다
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:53	Thank you for your time, Dr. Steiner.
		와주셔서 감사합니다, 박사님
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:55	Of course.
		아뇨 무슨
00:04:56	 
		 
00:05:00	Good-bye again, mr. Jane.
		그럼 잘 계시오, 제인씨
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	It wasn't your fault.
		당신 잘못 아닙니다
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	Excuse me?
		뭐라구요?
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	They had guns.
		총이 있었잖아요
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	Big, scary guns.
		There's nothing you could do.
		무섭고 커다란 총이요 박사님이 거기 있어봤자였어요
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:11	The body is my responsibility,
		my reason for being here.
		시체는 내 소관이요 내가 여기 있는 이유지
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	Now I have no reason
		or responsibility.
		이젠 전부 사라졌지만
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	There's nothing for me to do.
		I don't expect you to understand
		이젠 내가 여기서 할 일이 없지
		그쪽이 내 심경을 이해하리라고
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	Why that feels like failure to me,
		생각지도 않지만,
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	but it does.
		Want a cup of tea?
		내겐 어쨌든 쓰디쓰다오
		-차 한잔 어떠세요?
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	I don't think so.
		그럴 기분이 아니군
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:27	Suit yourself.
		좋을대로 하십쇼
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:29	I like the chapel in Yountville.
		Yountville의 교회가 좋긴 한데
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	It's just a long way
		for the guests to go.
		하객들 오기엔 너무 멀어
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	What did you find out about
		Vandermeer State Park?
		Vandermeer State Park 쪽은 알아봤어?
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	I love that place.
		난 거기 너무 좋아
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:41	I see.
		알겠어
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	Well, I guess we'll just keep looking.
		더 알아봐야지
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:45	I love you. Bye.
		사랑해, 안녕
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:48	Vandermeer State Park...
		Vandermeer State Park라..
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:50	Beautiful for a wedding.
		I've hiked there.
		결혼식엔 최적이지 하이킹 가봤어
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	There's an old quaker meeting house.
		오래된 퀘이커 회관이 있는데
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	Oh, it would be perfect,
		거기 너무 예뻐
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:56	But I guess they don't allow weddings.
		하지만 결혼식에 대관해주지 않을 것 같아
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	It's too hard on the
		ground vegetation.
		그 사람들 완고하니까
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	What do we have on Hartley?
		하틀리에 대해선 뭐 나왔어?
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	Jane was right.
		He was in finance.
		제인 말이 맞아요 금융권 사람입니다
00:06:03	 
		 
00:06:03	Ran a hedge fund called
		the H.V. Wilder Fund.
		HV Wilder Fund라는 펀드회사 소속이었어요
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	But his wife's family has the real money.
		Name's Cook. The Cooks?
		하지만 진짜 부자는 아내더군요 쿡 집안이라고
		-쿡?
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	Yeah, I guess.
		Wife's name is Peregrine.
		여자 이름은 페레그린입니다
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	I'll deal with the family.
		유가족한테는 내가 갈게
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	You go and talk to the
		people he worked with.
		넌 하틀리 직장 사람 만나봐
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Anything on the missing corpse?
		없어진 시체 쪽은?
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	Forensics found no
		usable prints on the van
		밴에선 쓸만한 지문이 안 나왔고
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	And nothing from the tire
		tracks at the scene.
		현장 타이어 자국도 마찬가집니다
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	Why steal a dead body?
		What can they use it for?
		뭣하러 시체를 가져갔을까요? 뭐에다 쓰게?
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	Got me.
		내가 아나
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	Go and have another talk with the
		two guys that were with Steiner.
		스타이너 박사랑 같이 있던 두명한테 다시 질문해
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	Get any details on the
		thieves or the truck.
		강도나 트럭에 관해 기억나는 거 없냐고
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	Van Pelt, look for
		any similar crimes,
		반펠트는 과거 비슷한 사건 좀 뒤져봐
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	Bodies that were
		stolen from hospitals,
		병원이나 구급차에서
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	ambulances, anything.
		Good luck with the Cooks.
		시신이 도난당했다던지 그런거
		-쿡 집안이라며요, 잘 다녀 오세요
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	Yeah, nothing like telling people
		유가족에게 사망 통지하러 가는건
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	Their loved ones are dead,
		언제나 최고지
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	And oh, by the way,
		we lost the corpse.
		그리고 플러스, 시신도 잃어버렸네요
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:45	None of this makes any sense.
		이 모든게 말이 안돼요
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:50	The last time I-I spoke to Tim,
		마지막으로 팀을 봤을때
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	He was telling me some stupid
		joke he heard at work,
		나한테 직장에서 들은 시시한 농담을 해줬죠
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:55	Happy as can be.
		여느때처럼 행복해 보였어요
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:57	Who's responsible, agent?
		그래서 누가 책임지나요? 요원
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:59	My son-in-law didn't just disappear.
		내 사위가 그냥 땅으로 꺼지진 않았을테고
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	Someone is accountable.
		Who?
		누군가 잘못한 사람이 있겠죠
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	Ma'am, we don't know yet.
		We're doing the best we can.
		부인, 저희도 아직은 알 수 없습니다 최선을 다하고 있습니다
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	Not good enough.
		Mother!
		최선은 아니겠지 -엄마!
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	My dear, when they tell you
		they're doing their very best,
		저 사람들이 최선을 다한다는 말은
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	That's exactly what they aren't doing.
		실제론 아무것도 하지 않는단 뜻이란다
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	Hell of a place you've got here.
		으리뻔쩍하군요
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:13	Where'd you get the money for it?
		Excuse me?
		이 돈은 다 어디서 버신 겁니까?
		-뭐라구요?
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	The moolah. The scratch.
		The shekels. The dollarinis.
		돈 말이에요, 돈 갈퀴로 긁어모으신 이 돈
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:19	What does that have
		to do with anything?
		그게 지금 하등 중요한가요?
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	Obviously something
		you're embarrassed about.
		확실히 당황하고 계십니다, 지금
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:24	Sugar beets. Sugar beets?
		사탕무예요 -사탕무?
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	My, uh, my grandfather grew them.
		조부께서 사탕무 농장을 하셨어요
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:28	I love sugar beets.
		사탕무라면 저도 좋아합니다
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	There's no shame in
		sugar beets, Elspeth.
		뭐 사탕무가 쪽팔린 일인가요?
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:33	Mrs. Hartley, we found
		your husband's body
		부군의 시신은 여기서
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	A hundred miles from here.
		수백마일 떨어진 곳에서 발견됐습니다
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	Any idea what he was doing out there?
		Uh, no, none at all.
		그곳에서 뭘 하고 계셨을까요?
		-전혀 모르겠어요
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	Was there anything out of the ordinary
		평소 태도와 다른 점은 없었습니까?
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	going on in his life?
		Troubles at work?
		직장에서 불화가 있었다던지?
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	Changes in his schedule?
		No. We started...
		평소 일정과 어긋난다던지?
		-아뇨 우리는..
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	Talking about having...
		우리는 막..
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:52	A family...
		아기를 가지려 하고 있었어요
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	A while back.
		얼마 전부터요
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:58	There, there, dear.
		그만 됐다, 얘야
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	If there are no more questions...
		더 무슨 질문이 없다면..
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	You didn't like your
		son-in-law, did you?
		사위가 마땅찮으셨지요?
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:05	You found him vulgar despite
		his highfalutin job.
		번듯한 직장에도 불구하고 삼류로 보셨죠
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	And you... you're frightened.
		그리고 시체가 사라졌다고 하자
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	The body's disappearance alarms
		you in a very specific way.
		무언가에 생각이 미치셨겠죠 불편하시구요
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	What is that?
		그게 뭡니까?
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	Harrison, please show
		our visitors out.
		해리슨, 손님 나가시는 길 봐드리게
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:24	Thank you. I'm good.
		나갑니다
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:29	Oh, God.
		이럴수가
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:31	Why do these things happen?
		어떻게 이런 일이 생길 수 있죠?
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:34	How long have you and Mr.
		Hartley been partners?
		하틀리씨와 파트너로 계시기는 얼마나 되셨습니까?
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	Oh, uh, five years or so.
		5년 정도죠
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:39	We were both interested in a fund
		우리 둘다 소수의 특정 부류만을
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	That offered slightly esoteric
		financial instruments.
		상대하는 펀드에 관심이 있었어요
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	A hedge fund.
		What we do is pretty complicated.
		그래서 헤지펀드겠죠
		-워낙이 전문적인 얘기라
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	I don't want to bore
		you with the details.
		말씀드려도 헤매실 겁니다
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	As I understand it,
		you rely on a strategy
		제가 알기론 선물시세에서의 수익 발생은
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	That exploits mean
		reversion tendencies
		회귀선상의 유동성 역류 현상에
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Of crosscurrent far forward rates.
		Is that right? Yes.
		선행한다는 이론을 지지하고 계시던데요, 맞습니까?
		-네
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:55	What did Mr. Hartley
		do for the fund?
		하틀리씨가 여기서 하는 일이 뭡니까?
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	Built it.
		Designed the strategy.
		전략을 설계했죠
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	Certifiable genius.
		The best.
		검증된 천재였습니다 최고였어요
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	A fund like yours can lose
		people a lot of money.
		펀드라면 돈을 잃는 사람도 있을텐데
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:04	Any angry investors? No, no, no.
		특히 낙심한 투자자는 없습니까? -아뇨
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	Recently, we've had excellent returns.
		최근에 저희는 엄청난 수익을 올리고 있었습니다
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	What about work?
		Did hartley have problems here?
		직장 생활은요? 문제는 없었습니까?
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:13	"Loved" Is the word.
		일을 진심으로 사랑했어요
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	How about trouble at home?
		No. Tim adored Peregrine.
		가정에서는요?
		-팀은 페레그린을 아꼈죠
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	He... he... he was a boy scout.
		팀은 바른생활 사나이였어요
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	He would never play around,
		wouldn't even think of it.
		바람을 피운다는 생각조차 하지 못했죠
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	He's a straight... straight arrow.
		아주 정인군자였어요
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	I see.
		알겠습니다
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	The straightest.
		군자 중 군자였죠
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:30	So nothing new from
		the guys with Steiner,
		스타이너 일행에선 아무것도 못 건졌어
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	But it wasn't an entirely
		wasted journey. I got scones.
		하지만 아주 허탕은 아니었지 스콘을 사왔거든
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:35	I found something.
		난 뭔가 찾은거 같아
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	Three other corpses have been stolen
		범행현장에서 출발한 차에서
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	From vehicles leaving crime scenes
		시신이 도난당한 경우가
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	over the past six months.
		Huh. Who caught the cases?
		반년새 세건 있었어
		-담당이 누군데?
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	We did. Rigsby. O'Laughlin.
		Why is the FBI on this?
		우리야, 릭스비
		-오러플린? FBI가 여기서 뭐해?
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	It's interstate. One of the
		corpses was taken in Nevada.
		연방 사건이야 시신 한구는 네바다에서 사라졌어
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	You guys have a theory? Yeah.
		가설은 있고? -응
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	We think the bodies are
		being sold at tissue banks.
		장기 은행에 팔리는 거 같아
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Tissue banks? They harvest bone
		and tissue from the corpses,
		장기은행? -시신에서 골수와 조직을 채취해서
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	Then sell them to
		medical supply houses.
		의료기관에 파는거지
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	You're supposed to get
		permission from the family
		시신을 그렇게 매매하려면
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	To sell the corpse, but these
		guys are skipping that part.
		가족 동의를 먼저 받아야 하지만 그러기 싫었나봐
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	And tissue banks are regulated,
		장기은행은 규제 하에 있으니
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	So more likely the thieves are
		working with the Funeral Home.
		강도들은 장의사와 협력하고 있을 가능성이 커
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	They provide the
		bodies to tissue banks.
		장의사 선에서 병원에 공급하는거지
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	I put together a list of
		Funeral Homes in the area.
		이 근처 장의사 명단을 뽑아놨어
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:06	We can start with that. Great, yeah.
		거기서부터 시작하자 -좋아
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:09	Hey, Rigsby, my boss
		asked me to come,
		릭스비, 여기 오란건 내 상관이야
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	You know, since I've worked
		with CBI before. Hmm.
		전에도 CBI랑 일해봤으니까
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	I'm not trying to get in
		your face is all I'm saying.
		되도록 네 신경 거스르지 않을게
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:17	Didn't think you were.
		그런다고 생각한 적 없는데
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	Okay, good. Okay.
		그럼 됐고
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:27	Dr. Steiner, I presume.
		스타이너 박사님이신것 같은데
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:30	What brings you back?
		어떻게 다시 돌아오셨습니까?
00:10:31	 
		 
00:10:33	Good news, actually.
		실은 좋은 소식이 있소
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	A small amount of blood was recovered
		시신이 놓여있던 땅바닥에서
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	From the dirt under the
		body at the crime scene.
		미량의 혈흔이 검출되었다오
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	It contains two distinct
		DNA signatures.
		구분되는 두개의 DNA 샘플이 나왔지
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	The killer got cut, too.
		범인도 손을 베였군요
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:44	Yes, probably while using
		a knife on the victim.
		칼을 쓰다가였겠지
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	There's not enough blood for an I.D.,
		신원을 확인하기엔 못 미쳐도
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:49	But there could be more on the corpse.
		시신에는 더 많은 증거가 있을거요
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	Interesting. Why did you come
		and tell me that in person
		재밌군요 전화로 하시면 될 얘기를
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	Instead of calling?
		뭣하러 개인적으로 오셔서 하십니까?
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	I would like to assist in some
		small way, if that's all right.
		괜찮다면 뭐로간에든 돕고 싶다오
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:01	Okay. Let's go get
		you a gun, shall we?
		좋습니다 총을 챙겨 나가십시다
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:07	Kidding. Welcome. Come on.
		장난이에요 이리 오세요
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:11	Look sharp, Lisbon.
		We have a visitor.
		조심해, 리스본 손님이 오셨어
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:17	Dr. Steiner? Can I help you?
		박사님? 어떻게 도와드릴까요?
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	Well, actually, I...
		그게 사실은..
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	Steiner's gonna be
		joining us for a while.
		박사님은 당분간 여기서 같이 일하실거야
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	Um... okay.
		오... 그러세요
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	What is all this mess? It's Hartley's
		calendar and phone records.
		그런게 이건 다 뭐람? -하틀리의 스케줄러와 전화번호부
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	We're making a list of people
		he saw before he died.
		죽기 전에 만난 사람들 명단을 만드는 중이야
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	Meh. Clerical work.
		따분하구만
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	We need to figure out what
		the big secret is. What big secret?
		그럴게 아니라 더 커다란 비밀을 파헤쳐야 해
		-커다란 비밀이라니?
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	Yeah, what big secret?
		그러게?
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	The big, weird secret that
		the widow and the partner
		대놓고 말하기엔 심하게 쪽팔린 나머지
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	And everyone won't tell us about
		미망인도 직장동료도 그 아무도 우리에게 말하지 못한
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	Because it's too shameful to mention.
		거대하고 괴상한 비밀 말이야
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	It's funny you should mention that.
		네가 그렇게 말하기 말인데
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	He... he did have an appointment
		every week with no description.
		매주 불명인 사람과 약속이 잡혀 있더라고
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Thursdays, 2:15 to 3:30.
		No name, no address. Interesting.
		매주 목요일 2:15부터 3:30까지 이름도 주소도 불명이야
		-흥미롭구만
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Clerical work, huh? Touch?
		이래도 따분해? -한방 먹는구만
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	If I may, his car's GPS
		might have an address.
		어쩌면 하틀리 차의 GPS에 주소가 남아 있을지 모르오
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	Yes, it might.
		정말 그렇네요
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	See? Useful already.
		이봐, 벌써 쓸모있네
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:05	2729 Hillview Avenue.
		2729 Hillview Avenue
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	This is the address
		in Hartley's GPS.
		GPS에 따르면 이곳이군요
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:10	Okay, what's the game with Steiner?
		너 박사랑 뭐하는거야?
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	No game. What's he doing here, then?
		아무것도 -그럼 저 분이 여기서 뭐하시는데?
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	What are any of us doing here?
		우리가 매일 하는거?
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	We don't bring guests
		on investigations.
		우린 수사 중에 외부인 안 끌어들여
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:18	Maybe we should. A different
		mystery sleuth for each case.
		왜, 매회 사건마다 신분 미스테리의 탐정이 등장하면 재밌잖아
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	Well, if this is some
		gag you're pulling...
		너 이거 또 네 되먹잖은 장난이면..
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	It's not. He asked
		if he could come along,
		아니야 나한테 같이 조사해도 되냐고 물었고,
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	And I said he could.
		All right? That's it.
		된다고 했을 뿐이야 그게 다야
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	We're building bridges,
		mending fences... okay.
		우린 서로간에 가교를 놓고 관계를 보수하고...
		-알았어
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Planting seeds... uh-huh.
		미래의 씨앗을 뿌리고...
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	Laying foundations. Okay.
		장래의 기초를 놓고... -알았다고
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	It's a medical building, G.P.'s,
		dentists, but mostly shrinks
		의사들이 대부분이군요 보건의에 치과의에..
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	How do you know who to talk to?
		대화상대가 누구였는지 어떻게 알아내지?
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	Any calls from his phone
		records to this address?
		이 주소로 핸드폰에 남은 번호는 없고?
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	No, but we can check his
		bank records for payments.
		아뇨, 하지만 계좌를 검색해서 지불내역을 볼 수는 있겠죠
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	Oh, we'd need a warrant for that.
		그러려면 영장이 있어야 하는데
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	I'd rather just
		start knocking on doors.
		차라리 일일이 문을 두들기는게 낫겠어
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	Then we're gonna
		need more people.
		그러려면 인원이 더 필요합니다
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	You'll have to clear that with admin.
		리셉션에 일단 물어나 보죠
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:50	Okay, everybody, outside! Outside!
		여러분! 대피하세요, 대피!
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Come on! It's not a drill! Whoo!
		어서요! 이거 실제상황입니다!
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	Oh, God, Jane.
		Why do you do things like this?
		이런 제길, 제인 왜 또 그래?
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:57	Hustle it out. Hustle it out.
		That's the way. Okay, come on.
		서두르세요, 이쪽입니다
00:12:59	 
		 
00:13:01	All of you.
		전부 나와요!
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:05	Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
		신사 숙녀 여러분
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	My name is Patrick Jane.
		I'm with the CBI.
		CBI에서 나온 패트릭 제인입니다
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	We are looking for the doctor
		who treated Timothy Hartley.
		티모시 하틀리의 담당 의사분을 찾습니다
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	I know you have a doctor/patient
		confidentiality thing.
		의사 환자간 기밀유지 조항 이런거 저도 압니다
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	Let's not worry about that right now.
		하지만 지금 당장은 넣어두세요
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	Would Timothy Hartley's doctor
		please raise his or her hand?
		티모시 하틀리 담당 의사분 손을 번쩍 들어주세요
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	Raise it on up.
		번쩍
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:25	I know it's one of you.
		Maybe to your right,
		여기 있는거 알아요 여러분 오른쪽에 있을수도
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	Maybe to your left. Up, up, up,
		up with your hand. Bring it up.
		여러분 왼쪽일수도 있습니다 손, 손, 손, 모두 손을 들어요
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:32	Okay, so no one has raised their hand.
		좋아요, 아무도 안 드시는데
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	That doesn't matter because
		I know that you, ma'am,
		상관없습니다, 이미 전 누군지 아니까요 거기 여성분
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	Are the person who we seek.
		Please come forward.
		바로 우리가 찾던 분이군요, 올라와 주시구요
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	Everyone else, thank you,
		and back to your quackery.
		다른 분들은 다 끝났으니 다시 환자 괴롭히러 가세요
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:46	What's your name, ma'am?
		성함이?
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Dr. Wendelyne McCormick.
		웬들린 맥코믹입니다
00:13:49	 
		 
00:13:50	And I won't discuss my patients
		그리고 누군가 내 환자였단 이유로는
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	Of the fact that
		someone is my patient.
		환자에 대해 아무것도 말하지 않을 겁니다
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	We're investigating the
		murder of Timothy Hartley.
		티모시 하틀리의 살인사건 수사중입니다
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	He was killed last night.
		어젯밤 살해당했죠
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:59	Oh, god.
		이런
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:02	All right.
		알겠어요
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:05	How did you know it was me?
		어떻게 저인줄 아셨죠?
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	Everyone else was looking
		around to see who it was,
		다들 두리번 거리는데
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	But you weren't, because you knew.
		혼자만 가만 계셨으니까요
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:13	Great. The fire department.
		I'll go talk to 'em.
		경사났네 소방관 왔다 내가 가서 말할게
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:17	Tim had been in therapy
		for about four months.
		팀은 넉달간 치료를 받았어요
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	He'd had a traumatizing experience
		극복해야 할
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	That he wanted to work through.
		What kind of an experience?
		트라우마 경험이 있었거든요
		-그게 무슨 경험이었죠?
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:25	Agent, can I get some assurance
		of discretion from you?
		기밀 유지를 좀 부탁해도 될까요?
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	It's a sensitive matter
		to the people around him.
		환자 주변분들에겐 극히 민감한 사안이라서요
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	We can't promise anything.
		아무것도 약속 못 드립니다
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	Very well.
		알겠어요, 그럼..
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:35	About five months ago,
		다섯달 쯤 전에
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:37	He had an abduction experience.
		Excuse me?
		납치당했다고 주장했어요
		-뭐라구요?
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	He believed he was abducted
		by extraterrestrial beings...
		외계존재에 납치당해서
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:46	Taken to their ship, examined,
		우주선에 실려가고, 검사받고,
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	And released.
		풀려났다고 했어요
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:54	Kidnapped by aliens.
		외계인한테 납치당했대
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:57	Cool.
		죽인다
00:14:58	 
		 
00:15:01	I was being lifted by
		the light, up and away.
		빛이 내려오더니 절 끌어올렸어요
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	I-I couldn't... couldn't do anything.
		전 아무것도 할 수 없었어요
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	I was just being...
		taken right to the ship.
		그 상태로 우주선에 실려갔어요
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	It happened when
		Hartley was driving home
		리노에서 집으로 돌아올때
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	From a trip to Reno.
		당한 일이라더군요
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	We found a couple of these
		videos on his personal laptop,
		하틀리의 컴퓨터에서 비슷한 영상 몇개가 더 나왔습니다
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	Some kind of diary of the event.
		그 사건에 관한 기록 같은거요
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	And once on the ship, there were...
		우주선에 오르자
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:20	There were beings all around me,
		그 존재들이 제곁에 둘러서 있었는데
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:23	Small...
		작고...
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:25	Small...
		작은..
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	Just ash gray.
		피부가 잿빛이었어요
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:29	And there were a
		little taller ones too...
		개중 좀 큰 것도 있었지만
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	They're the same color.
		색깔은 같았죠
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	They were leaders, I think.
		키가 큰 그룹이 지도자였겠죠
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:34	It just all feels so...
		모든게 너무...
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:38	It feels so concrete,
		실제같고
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	So real.
		진짜 같았어요
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	Crazy. He sounds sincere to me.
		정신이 외출하셨네
		-말하는게 진심 같은데요
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	Sincerely cuckoo.
		I don't see any sign he's lying.
		진심으로 돌았으니 그렇지
		-거짓말하는 걸론 안 보입니다만
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	It could be a dream
		that he experienced
		반수면 상태에서 경험한 꿈일거요
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	During a hypnagogic state.
		That would make it true for him,
		그 자신에겐 실제처럼 여겨지지만
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	But not objectively real. Exactly.
		I agree with him completely.
		진짜라곤 할 수 없지
		-난 여기에 완전 동의
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	Thousands of people say
		it's happened to them.
		수천명의 사람들이 외계인에 대한 증언을 하잖아요
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	They can't all be crazy or lying. Hmm.
		그 사람들이 전부 미쳤거나 거짓말을 할린 없어요
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:01	I'm just saying you
		should keep an open mind.
		그러니까 제 말은 제인씨가 마음을 여시라구요
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	You can't prove there aren't aliens.
		외계인이 없다고 증명할 수 있는 것도 아니잖아요
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	That's true. Okay, the point is,
		그건 그렇지 -그래서 말이야
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	the wife had to have known about this.
		아내는 이걸 알고 있었을거란 말이지
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:10	We need to talk to her again. Yeah.
		다시 가서 얘기해 볼 필요가 있어
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	Where are we with the body hunt?
		시체 도난 쪽은 어때?
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	We've identified eight funeral parlors
		장기 은행과 거래한 적이 있는
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	That had extensive legitimate
		dealings with tissue banks.
		여덟곳 장의사를 확인해 놨어요
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	We're gonna start with them.
		We're splitting the interviews
		오러플린과 같이 각각 수소문 하려구요
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	with O'Laughlin.
		All right, let me know what you find.
		잘했어 뭔가 나오면 연락하고
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	Okay. Watch the skies, Grace.
		하늘을 항상 주시하라고, 그레이스
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:27	Tim told me as soon as it happened.
		팀은 그 일이 있고 바로 제게 말했어요
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	He said he met them in a
		field outside Auburn.
		어번 외곽의 공터에서 당했다고 했죠
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	Where we found his body? Mm-hmm.
		시신을 발견한 그곳이요?
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:37	He kept going back.
		He couldn't tell me why.
		왜인지 모르겠다며 자주 그곳을 찾곤 했어요
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	I mean, he knew it wasn't rational.
		합리적이지 못한 행동이라는건 알았지만...
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:43	Why didn't you tell us this before?
		왜 전에는 이 말씀을 않으셨죠?
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	I got a call from Art Vella,
		Art Vella, 팀의 파트너에게서 전화를 받았어요
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:48	Tim's partner.
		저한테 말하지 말라고 하더군요
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	He told me not to
		mention it, begged me.
		거의 빌다시피요
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	He said it would be
		devastating for the business.
		사업상에 큰 문제가 생길거라 했어요
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:56	You believed your husband's
		story, didn't you?
		남편분 말을 믿으셨군요?
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:58	That's why you were so scared
		when the body disappeared.
		그래서 시신이 없어지자 외계인 소행인줄 알고 두려우셨구요?
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:02	Okay, okay.
		알겠어요
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:04	Listen to me.
		제가 분명히 말하지만
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:06	My husband wasn't crazy.
		남편은 미치지 않았어요
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:10	Okay?
		아시겠어요?
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	He wouldn't lie to me about
		something like that.
		남편은 그런걸로 제게 거짓말할 사람이 아니에요
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	Rubbish! When someone tells you
		something contrary to fact,
		어림없는 소리! 누군가 말도 안되는걸 말할때
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	They are lying, full stop.
		그걸 바로 거짓말이라고 하는거다
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	Don't start, mother.
		그만 두세요, 엄마
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Agents, my son-in-law was
		drunk or drug-addled or both.
		사위는 당시 취했거나 약을 했거나 둘 다였을 겁니다
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:26	As for this tabloid trash
		about men from Mars...
		이따위 허섭쓰레기 같은 외계인 얘기는..
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	Ladies. How can you say that?
		어떻게 그런 식으로 말씀하세요?
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	Ridiculous. Just ridiculous!
		This is so like you, mother...
		정말 엄마는 항상 그런 식이네요
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	I've never heard
		such twaddle in my life...
		내 평생 이런 미친 소린 들어본 적이 없어
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	so closed off and close-minded.
		And he said it with a straight face.
		속좁고 편견에 차 있는건 엄마예요!
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	You honestly think...
		솔직히 말해서...
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Ladies. Ladies, that's enough.
		두분 다 그만 하세요
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	Wait. What are you looking for?
		잠깐 찾는게 뭐요?
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:42	Ah, yes.
		아 그러니까요...
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:46	You're a scotch man, right?
		말하자면 스카치 파죠?
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:51	Uh, yes. I...
		그렇다오
00:17:53	 
		 
00:18:01	Oh, no, no. I-I shouldn't.
		아니, 이럴 순 없소
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:04	You really should.
		이러셔야 해요
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:08	Cheers.
		쨘
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:16	You know, don't you?
		알고 있군요
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	Excuse me?
		네?
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	You know that I'm sick.
		내게 병이 있다는걸
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:22	Why would Patrick Jane, of all people,
		그렇지 않다면 다른 사람도 아닌 패트릭 제인이
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	Invite me to a fancy house
		근사한 집으로 날 불러들여
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	And put a first-rate scotch
		in my hand if he didn't know?
		상등품 스카치를 따라 쥐어줄까
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:31	You've lost some weight... 8 pounds.
		체중이 주셨죠, 한 8파운드 정도
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	Yes.
		그렇소
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:36	Your face is looking drawn.
		얼굴이 야위셨는데
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	You're taking some
		powerful medication.
		독한 약을 복용하기 때문이겠죠
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	I can see it in the
		pallor of your skin.
		병색이 드러납니다
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	Yes.
		그렇다오
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:45	I'm dying.
		난 죽어가고 있소
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:47	I have a month...
		남은건 몇달..
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	Most likely, maybe less.
		어쩌면 적을 수도 있지
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:54	I'm sorry.
		유감입니다
00:18:56	 
		 
00:19:03	Thank you for the distraction.
		상대해줘서 고맙소
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:07	Well, it's always good to...
		물론 언제나..
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:09	Keep busy.
		바쁘게 사는게 좋죠
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:12	There's probably some, uh,
		Havana cigars in that box there.
		그 앞 상자에 아마 쿠바산 시가가 있을겁니다
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	No. No, no. I...
		아니, 안되지
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	I couldn't.
		그럼 안되는데
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:20	Could I?
		되나?
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:24	Well, you're right.
		정말 그렇군
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:28	This is a good cigar.
		정말 좋은 시가요
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:38	The only other time
		내가 전에 딱 한번
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	That I had been in a room like this
		이런 곳에 왔을때는
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:43	Was to examine a man
		who died accidentally
		자위하다 죽은 남자를
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	In the middle of an autoerotic ritual.
		검시하러 왔을 때였지
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	Well, I bet he died with
		a smile on his face.
		보살미소를 띄우며 죽었다에 걸지요
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:58	Excuse me.
		실례합니다
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	Can I help you? Ahem.
		제가 도와드릴 일이 있습니까?
		-떠나려던 참이었네요
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:10	Why did you tell Peregrine
		Hartley to lie to us, sir?
		페레그린 하틀리에게 거짓을 사주한 까닭이 뭡니까?
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:14	I didn't tell her to lie.
		거짓을 사주하다뇨
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	I asked Peregrine not to raise
		certain relevant information.
		특정 정보를 굳이 환기하지 말라 부탁했을 뿐이오
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:22	Why'd you do that?
		왜 그러셨습니까?
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:25	Tim was the brain.
		I handled clients, administration.
		팀은 회사의 브레인이고 나는 고객 담당이오
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	Tim was the brain.
		It's all about confidence.
		팀이 회사의 브레인이라고 이건 신뢰의 문제요
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	If the investors hear about
		alien probes and whatnot,
		투자자들이 만에 하나 외계인 소리를 들으면
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	Confidence goes right out the window.
		우리 신뢰는 창문에서 뛰어내려 자살할거요
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	Then I assume you asked him not
		to talk about this. Constantly.
		하틀리에게도 입단속을 시키셨겠군요
		-물론이아마다
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:39	But Mr. Hartley
		was growing certain
		하지만 하틀리씨는
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	His experiences were real.
		자기 경험이 실제라고 고집했구요
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:42	He must've wanted to talk about it.
		어딘가 말하고 싶어했겠죠
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:45	We had some arguments about it.
		Bad arguments?
		그 일로 언쟁이 있긴 했소
		-심각했습니까?
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	I didn't kill tim because he wanted
		하틀리가 그 미친 소리를 언론에 흘리고 싶어한다고 해서
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	To go public with his cuckoo story.
		사람을 죽이진 않소
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:52	You need to talk to that UFO
		fruitcake that Tim met.
		팀이 만나던 UFO 오타쿠를 찾는게 좋을거요
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	They're friends about a week,
		안지는 한주 정도 됐는데
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	And then tim wanted nothing
		more to do with him.
		팀은 별 생각 없었겠지만
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	I think he was trying to
		상대는 팀에게서
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	squeeze some money out of Tim.
		What's his name?
		한몫 뜯어낼 궁리인것 같았소
		-이름은요?
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	Kirk. Can you believe that?
		커크라오(역주:스타트렉 선장) 어이없지 않소?
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:05	Newsom Kirk.
		뉴섬 커크
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:08	Is there any way
		you can keep this quiet?
		제발 이 일에 대해 조용히 해 줄수 없겠소?
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	I doubt it.
		$2.8 billion in assets.
		어렵겠는데요
		- 280억 달러가 걸려 있소
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	We're going down because
		my partner thought he was
		회사 파트너가 녹색 난쟁이들한테
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	kidnapped by little green men.
		잡혀갔다고 떠들어대는 한 우린 끝장이오
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Gray.
		회색입니다
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:22	What?
		뭐요?
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	The little men. They're gray.
		엄연한 회색 난쟁이라구요
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:26	Thanks for your time. Appreciate it.
		감사합니다
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:28	Two down, two to go.
		Wanna grab some food?
		두개 해치웠고 두곳 남았네 뭣 좀 먹을까?
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	Oh, there's an errand I wanna run.
		다녀올데가 있어
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	Give me half an hour. I'll catch up.
		30분 걸릴텐데 뒤쫓아 갈게
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:33	Where you going? I'll take you.
		어딘데? 같이 가자
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:34	You don't need to do that.
		Oh, come on. How far is it?
		그럴 필요 없는데 -괜찮아, 얼마나 멀길래?
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	It's a little ways. It's okay.
		잠깐이면 돼
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	It's a wedding thing. Oh, I see.
		실은 드레스 때문에 그래 -아아
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:42	Why don't I drop you off?
		I'll grab something to eat,
		가다 내려줄게 난 군것질이나 하고
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	And then stay in the car, okay?
		차에서 기다리면 되지 그렇지?
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:47	Sure.
		그래
00:21:48	 
		 
00:22:09	Hello.
		여보세요
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	O'Laughlin. I tried Grace.
		She didn't answer.
		오러플린이야 그레이스한테 전화했는데 안 받네
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	She's busy.
		I've got something.
		그레이스 바빠 -뭔가 찾았어
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Gary Wineman, funeral director.
		개리 와인먼
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	Mentioned tissue banks,
		and he got very nervous.
		장기은행 얘기를 했더니 눈에 띄게 불안해했어
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:21	Mr. Wineman, these are
		my colleagues from CBI,
		와인먼씨, 이쪽은 CBI에서 나온
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:23	Agents Rigsby and Van Pelt.
		릭스비 요원, 반펠트 요원입니다
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:26	Did agent O'Laughlin mention
		what this was about, sir?
		오러플린 요원에게서 말씀은 들으셨죠?
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:28	Uh, some... bodies have been stolen
		시체가 도난됐고
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	That might have gone to a tissue bank?
		아마도 장기은행에 팔렸을 수 있다는거요?
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:33	No, that's the FBI's investigation.
		그건 FBI일이고
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	We're investigating a murder.
		저희는 살인사건 수사중입니다
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:37	Oh.
		You didn't say anything about that.
		그런 말씀은 없었는데
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:43	I certainly don't know anything about it.
		Well, I hope so, sir.
		정말 아는 바가 없는데요
		-그러시길 바랍니다
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	A case like this,
		anyone connected to it...
		이런 사건에서는 관련자는 물론
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	Even remotely connected...
		is in big trouble.
		간접적으로 관련된 사람조차도 신세 망치거든요
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	Best thing to protect yourself...
		그러니 가장 안전하게는..
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Be very clear about what you
		know and what you've done.
		뭘 아시는지 뭘 하셨는지 사실대로 말씀하시는 겁니다
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:56	Oh, god. Uh, look...
		오 저런..
00:22:58	 
		 
00:23:00	W-we...
		우 우리는
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	My wife had a baby girl,
		저희 부부는 딸애가 생겨서
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	And we needed a little extra cash,
		급전이 필요했어요
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	So I started selling
		bodies to tissue banks...
		그래서 장기은행에 시신을 팔기 시작했는데
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:11	A-all... all legitimate.
		다 합법적으로..
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	I got permission every time.
		매번 동의도 받았습니다
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:15	But the banks always want more bodies,
		하지만 은행에선 항상 독촉을 해대서
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	And my wife got pregnant again.
		그리고 아내가 또 임신해버리는 바람에
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	Look, who came to you?
		그래서 누굽니까?
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	My cousin. Not a good person.
		사촌이요 썩 좋은 사람은 아닌데
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	He said that if we split the fee,
		수익을 나누면
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:27	He could provide bodies,
		no permission necessary.
		시신을 공급하겠댔어요 동의는 필요없고
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	All I have to do was
		dummy up paperwork,
		저는 서류작업만 해주면 된다고
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	Giving them false names.
		Did he bring you a corpse today?
		가짜 이름을 사용해서요
		-오늘 가져온 시신은 없습니까?
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	No, no, no, no.
		But I... he has done this before
		아뇨, 아니요 하지만 이 같은 일을
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	With other funeral homes.
		His name is Owen Melling.
		다른 장의사들과도 해왔어요 이름은 오웬 멜링입니다
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:41	I-I-I had no I...
		where is he now, sir?
		저, 저는 아무..
		-그 사람 지금 어딨습니까?
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:45	Melling's done time for
		assault, armed robbery,
		멜링은 폭행, 무장강도,
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	And truck hijacking.
		트럭 하이재킹 전과가 있어
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	Did the truck jobs with a
		buddy named Jim Matthews.
		짐 매튜라는 친구와 함께 저질렀고
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:50	Both are on parole.
		Melling owes 15 years, Matthews... 12.
		둘다 가석방중이고 오웬은 15년, 매튜는 12년짜리
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	And they know if they get picked up,
		체포하러 왔다는 걸 알면
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:55	They're violated back in.
		It's good times.
		엄청 저항할거야 잘됐지
00:23:57	 
		 
00:24:01	Owen Melling?
		CBI.
		오웬 멜링? CBI다
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	We need to talk to you about
		a robbery this morning.
		오늘 아침 강도건에 관해 질문할게 있다
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:07	Just wanna get some facts straight.
		사실 관계만 물어볼 작정이니
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:09	Come down to the office,
		and we can explain.
		얌전히 동행하면 서에서 설명하겠다
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:10	Jim. Cops.
		짐, 경찰이야
00:24:13	 
		 
00:24:15	Jim Matthews?
		Yeah. What's up?
		짐 매튜? -무슨 일이요?
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:17	Says it's about some
		robbery this morning.
		오늘 아침에 강도 사건이 있었대
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:20	So what?
		그래서?
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:21	We were right here. That's right.
		Been here all day.
		우린 여기 있었소
		-하루종일
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:24	Yeah, well, we still
		need to talk to you.
		알았는데 그래도 같이 가줘야겠어
00:24:25	 
		 
00:24:26	Now get your hands
		out of your pocket.
		주머니에서 손 빼
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	Hands where we can see 'em.
		You heard him. Now.
		손을 우리가 볼 수 있게
		-지시를 따라
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:31	Don't hassle my boy!
		He ain't done nothin'!
		내 아들에게 허튼짓 하지 마! 아무것도 안했으니까!
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	Put the weapon down, ma'am.
		총을 내려놓으십쇼, 아주머니
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	You just wanna make more
		trouble for him. I won't have it.
		내 아들을 또 귀찮게 굴려는 모양인데 그렇겐 두지 않겠어
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	We just wanna talk to your son.
		Everything's gonna be fine.
		가서 얘기만 할 겁니다 아무 일 없어요
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	Just put down the gun, ma'am.
		그러니 총부터 내려놓으십쇼
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:48	Gun!
		총이다!
00:24:49	 
		 
00:25:15	O'Llaughlin, Grace is in trouble.
		Cover me.
		오러플린, 그레이스에게 문제가 있어 날 엄호해
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:23	O'Laughlin!
		오러플린!
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:26	Grace, get down!
		그레이스, 숙여!
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:32	On the ground! Face down! Now!
		땅에 머리 박아!
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:37	Get on the ground!
		박으라고!
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:46	How'd the interview
		with Matthews go?
		짐 매튜 심문은 어떻게 됐어요?
00:25:47	 
		 
00:25:47	Didn't.
		He asked for a lawyer.
		변호사 불러달래
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	What'd you find in Melling's house?
		No sign of Hartley's body.
		멜링 집에선 뭐 없어?
		- 하틀리 시신은 없었어요
00:25:52	 
		 
00:25:52	Forensics is checking
		the pickup for DNA.
		법의학팀이 픽업트럭에서 DNA 채취중입니다
00:25:54	 
		 
00:25:54	I got something.
		According to his cell phone records,
		여기 뭔가 있네요 통화내역을 보니
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	Melling made a call yesterday
		to a Wellview Funeral Home.
		멜링이 Wellview 장례식장과 어제 통화했어요
00:25:59	 
		 
00:25:59	Could be where they
		dropped off Hartley's body.
		하틀리 시신이 거기 갔을 수 있어
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:01	Get Steiner and go and check it out.
		If the body's there,
		스타이너 박사와 같이 가봐
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	He's the one to I.D. It.
		Sure.
		시신이 맞으면 박사가 확인해 줄거야
00:26:04	 
		 
00:26:04	Tracked down an address
		for Newsom Kirk,
		뉴섬 커크 주소 확인했습니다
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:06	the guy Hartley had
		a falling-out with.
		하틀리와 최근에 불미스런 일이 있었다는데
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	He runs an organization for abductees
		제4세대 재단이라고 피랍자를 위한
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:09	Called the Fourth Kind Foundation.
		조직을 운영하고 있더군요
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:11	Office is downtown.
		Does he have a sheet?
		사무실은 시내에 있습니다
		-더 알려진건 없고?
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:13	Running it now.
		제가 알아볼게요
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	We'll go talk to him.
		Call if anything pops. Okay.
		가서 얘기해 볼테니 뭐 나오면 전화해
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:21	Newsom Kirk, I'm agent Lisbon.
		뉴섬 커크, 리스본 요원입니다
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:24	This is agent Cho.
		We're with the CBI.
		이쪽은 조요원, CBI에서 나왔습니다
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	Yes, yes. You called. Welcome.
		전화하셨죠 어서오세요
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	Welcome.
		어서오세요
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:30	Agent Cho, you... you've...
		you've been, haven't you?
		조요원.. 혹시.. 거기 같이 있지 않았습니까?
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	Excuse me?
		네?
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	Up. Taken, with them.
		위에, 피랍되어, 그들과 함께요
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:38	No.
		전혀요
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	Well, I'm getting a... I'm
		getting a definite sense.
		난 느낌이 딱 오는데요
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:43	It sometimes takes a person years
		어떤 사람들은 기억을 되살리는데
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	To realize they've had the experience.
		수년의 시간이 걸리기도 하지요
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	Timothy Hartley.
		Of course. Sorry.
		티모시 하틀리 말입니다
		-아 그렇죠
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:51	You met him through
		the foundation, right?
		재단에서 만나셨죠?
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:53	Yeah. We're here to serve abductees,
		우린 여기서 피랍자들이
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	Um, help them come to terms
		with their experience.
		그 경험을 이겨내도록 도움을 주고 있습니다
00:26:59	 
		 
00:26:59	Oh. Spread the word.
		세상에 진실을 알리기도 하구요
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:01	Uh, Tim wanted to talk about
		what he'd been going through.
		팀은 자기가 겪은 일을 말하고 싶어했고,
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	He asked us to keep it in
		confidence, and... and we did.
		비밀 유지를 부탁해서 그렇게 했습니다
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:06	And that's all you did...
		talk about his experience?
		그럼 말을 들어주신게 답니까?
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	No. As a matter of fact,
		Tim had a lot of money.
		에 사실은 티모시가 돈이 많았어요
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:12	And frankly, we... we need money,
		솔직히 우린 늘 돈이 필요하구요
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	We had... we had several
		quite serious discussions
		그래서 재단을 금전적으로 보조하는데 관해
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	About funding this... this place.
		진지한 대화를 몇번 나눴죠
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:21	As a child...
		혹시 어릴때..
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:23	Did... did you have, um, dreams
		자면서..
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:25	Where you were floating
		through the house
		보이지 않는 힘에 이끌려
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:27	As though pulled by an unseen force?
		지붕 위로 떠올랐거나 하는 꿈을 꾸지 않았나요?
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:30	No.
		아니라구요
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:32	Uh, we heard that the, uh, two of you
		저희가 듣기로는 두분 간에
00:27:35	 
		 
00:27:35	Had some sort of a falling-out?
		약간의 언쟁이 있었다고 하던데요
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:37	He decided that he wanted to
		start his own foundation.
		그는 자신의 재단을 만들고 싶어했죠
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	Uh, his right, I say.
		It never got angry?
		그럴수도 있다고 했죠
		-그걸로 화가 나셨나요?
00:27:42	 
		 
00:27:42	No, no. Uh, if you're looking
		티모시와 문제가 있었던 사람을
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:45	For someone Tim
		had a fight with,
		찾는 중이시라면
00:27:46	 
		 
00:27:47	You should talk to that shrink of his.
		그의 주치의와 만나보시죠
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:49	Uh, McCormick.
		맥코믹인가 했을 겁니다
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:52	She wanted to write a book about him.
		티모시에 관한 책을 쓰고 싶어 했는데
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	He said no. She was angry.
		허락하지 않자 화가 많이 났었죠
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Okay. Boss, from Rigsby.
		보스, 릭스비입니다
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:59	Uh, Mr. Newsom, is your
		real name Garrett Rosten?
		뉴섬씨 본명이 Garrett Rosten 맞습니까?
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:03	And did you spend a year
		in Chino prison for fraud?
		치노 교도소에서 사기죄로 복역하셨구요?
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:06	Because your arrest
		record says you did.
		기록에 그렇게 나오네요
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:09	In my previous life, I
		was Garrett Rosten, yes.
		과거엔 확실히 Garrett Rosten란 이름을 썼죠
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:13	Mr. Hartley seems like the kind of guy
		하틀리씨는 분명 누군가에게
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:15	Who would research somebody
		금전적 지원을 하기 전에
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	If he was considering funding them.
		상대의 뒷조사를 하는 타입일거란 말이죠
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:18	Did he find out about this?
		I never hid Garrett.
		그가 이 사실을 알았나요?
		-숨긴적이 없습니다
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	I'm simply a different person now.
		Not that different.
		나는 새로 태어났습니다
		-딱히 그런거 같진 않은데요
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	There's a bench warrant out for
		your arrest for kiting checks.
		공수표 발행으로 판사 영장이 나온 상태군요
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:30	We're gonna have to take you in.
		Turn around, please.
		같이 가셔야겠습니다
		-돌아서 주십시오
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:33	It's... it's okay. It's...
		이거..괜찮아
00:28:35	 
		 
00:28:35	Just a misunderstanding.
		그냥 좀 사소한 오해야
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:38	Hey, agent.
		이봐요, 요원
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	The important thing is that you
		take a look inside yourself
		자신의 내면을 성찰하며
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:43	And start questioning
		those experiences...
		혼자서는 설명할 수 없는
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	That you can't explain.
		그 경험에 대해 차근차근 질문해 보는게 좋아요
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	Never happened.
		그런거 없습니다
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:49	I believe you.
		그러길 바라
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:53	Wake up.
		어딜 자
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:57	Newsom Kirk posted bail.
		He's gonna be gone in an hour.
		뉴섬 커크는 보석금을 내고 한시간내로 풀려날거야
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:01	Just in time for the
		6:10 to Alpha Centauri.
		알파 센타우리로 출항할 시간이구만
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:03	He was right about
		Hartley's psychiatrist.
		하틀리의 정신과 의사에 관한 말은 사실이었어
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	She did propose a book,
		but she withdrew it.
		책 출간을 제안했지만 거절당했지
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:08	So she had motive. Kinda.
		그러니까 동기가 있어 -그럴수도
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:10	Who do you think did it?
		Jabba the Hutt.
		네 생각엔 누구 같아?
		-타투인짱 자바더헛
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	Seriously. Ming the merciless.
		장난할래
		-플래시의 영원한 숙적 Ming
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	Okay. Alf?
		그럼 외계인 알프?
00:29:16	 
		 
00:29:17	When the aliens do come,
		I hope they eat you. Mm.
		외계인이 오면 말이지, 너부터 잡아먹어주면 좋겠다
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:24	Lisbon.
		리스본입니다
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	Theresa, Brenda Shettrick.
		테레사, 브렌다예요
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	A local news crew is about
		to interview Dr. Steiner
		지역뉴스팀이 스타이너 박사와 인터뷰하려 해요
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	About the Hartley case.
		Just thought you'd like to know.
		하틀리 사건 때문에요 알고 있는게 좋겠어요
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:32	He's supposed to be looking
		for Hartley's body.
		하틀리 시신을 확인하러 갔을텐데
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	No, he's here.
		아뇨, 여기 있는걸요
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	What interview?
		무슨 인터뷰요?
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:38	Some background on tissue
		banks and the corpse trade.
		장기은행과 시신 밀거래에 관해서요
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:40	There's a lot of interest.
		He offered to do it.
		흥미로운 주제죠 본인이 자원했어요
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:42	You didn't know anything?
		전혀 모르고 계셨어요?
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:44	I'll be right there.
		곧 갈게요
00:29:45	 
		 
00:29:48	Bye, Lisbon. Oh.
		잘 갔다와, 리스본
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:53	The legitimate trade in
		tissue is a valuable source
		인체조직의 합법적 거래는
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	Of biological material
		for medical use.
		의료 목적을 위한 인체자원의 소중한 보고입니다
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:58	Unfortunately, this illegal trade
		그러나 불행하게도 불법적 밀거래가
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	Has halted the investigation
		티모시 하틀리씨의 죽음을 수사하는
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	Into the death of Timothy Hartley.
		How's that?
		과정에서 큰 불편을 초래하고 있습니다
		-어떻게요?
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	Well, I-I just came
		from a funeral home
		하틀리씨의 시신이 있다고 여겨지던
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	Where we had hoped to find mr.
		Hartley's body,
		장례식장을 막 방문했는데
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:09	And it's... it's... it's not there.
		거기 없었죠
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	The thieves have hidden it somewhere.
		강도들이 시신을 다른 곳에 숨겨놨어요
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	And there is crucial
		evidence... blood evidence...
		그리고 제겐 결정적인 혈흔 증거가 있습니다
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	On Mr. Hartley's body that
		will identify the killers.
		범인을 특정할 수 있는 증거가 시신에 남아있어요
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	Brenda.
		If we don't find that evidence...
		브렌다, 저거..
		-만약 우리가 증거를 입수하지 못하면..
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	Now. Guys, that's it.
		Thanks very much.
		좋습니다, 여기까지 감사합니다
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	Did I do something wrong?
		제가 뭐 잘못한 거라도?
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:25	We don't talk to the
		press about evidence.
		언론에 증거에 관해 흘리면 안되요
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	It kinda tells the killer
		what we're looking for.
		범인이 듣고 이용할 수 있으니까요
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	Oh. Sorry.
		오, 미안합니다
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:31	How did I do otherwise?
		Oh, good.
		그것 말고 다른건 어땠습니까?
		-잘하셨어요
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:37	Hey, Cho.
		선배
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	Yeah.
		어
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:39	I think O'Laughlin flaked
		on Van Pelt yesterday.
		오러플린이 반펠트에게 그리 열심이지 않은것 같아
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:43	What do you mean?
		무슨 소리야?
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:44	Well, he saw she was in trouble
		and he didn't do anything.
		반펠트가 위험에 처했는데 꼼짝도 못하더라고
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:47	Guess he was scared. It happens.
		완전 쫄았나봐 -그럴 수 있지
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	Yeah. Van Pelt doesn't know this?
		반펠트는 이걸 몰라?
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:52	No.
		응
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	I don't know.
		사실 모르겠어
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:55	The question is,
		does she need to know?
		문제는, 그녀가 이걸 알아야 하나?
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:58	Yeah, it's tough.
		Your call.
		쉬운 결정은 아니지만 네가 알아서 해야지
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:08	You saw the news story
		on Hartley's body?
		검시관 스타이너요 하틀리에 관한 뉴스 보셨소?
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:11	Well, I lied. I did find the body.
		그렇소, 거짓말이었소 시신은 찾아냈소
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	There is evidence on it,
		증거도 확보했고
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:17	And it will convict you of murder.
		그리고 당신을 살인죄로 기소할 작정이오
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:20	But I haven't given
		the police the body.
		하지만 아직 경찰에 시신을 넘기진 않았소
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	I've kept it, and
		I'm willing to sell it,
		거래할 생각이오
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:25	Along with my silence, for $50,000.
		내가 입을 다무는 조건으로 5만 달러가 필요하오
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:29	Because I'm a dying man.
		내 살 날이 얼마 남지 않았소
00:31:31	 
		 
00:31:32	All I want is a few days of
		real comfort before I'm gone.
		죽기 전에 여유있는 생활을 하고 싶소
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:36	Think about it.
		You know how to reach me.
		생각해 보고, 연락하시오
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:43	How was that?
		어땠습니까?
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:45	Not bad.
		그럭저럭
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	Little over-the-top,
		살짝 오버하셨네요
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	But, you know, credible, nonetheless.
		하지만 꽤 그럴듯 했어요
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	Sorry.
		미안하군
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:53	Still getting used
		to all this deception.
		여전히 이런 사기치는덴 서툴러서
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:55	What deception?
		사기라뇨?
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:56	You did find Hartley's
		body at a funeral home.
		장례식장에서 시신을 찾았잖아요
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:59	Yes, but there was no
		blood evidence on it.
		하지만 증거따윈 없었잖소
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:01	You can't catch a fish without bait.
		미끼 없이 고기를 잡겠습니까?
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	We will tell agent Lisbon
		what's going on, yes?
		리스본 요원에게 사실대로 말할거죠?
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	Oh, yeah, eventually.
		Agent Lisbon's a good person.
		나중엔 하겠죠
		-리스본 요원은 좋은 사람이오
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:11	She reminds me of...
		그녀는 내게...
00:32:12	 
		 
00:32:14	Never mind.
		됐소다
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:15	Showtime. Huh?
		Let's go.
		쇼타임, 맞죠? 가봅시다
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	Whoo! Whoo!
		히-하!
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:20	Yes?
		여보세요?
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:28	Testing one, two.
		원, 투
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	Testing two.
		투
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:33	Yes, Dr. Steiner, We can
		hear you, just like before.
		네 여기서 아주 잘 들립니다, 박사님 좀전과 다름없이요
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	I'm a little nervous.
		조금 긴장이 되는구려
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	You're doing a great job.
		You look the part.
		아주 잘 하고 계십니다 적역이세요
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:40	Are you sure about this?
		너 이거 정말 자신있어?
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	Are you ever gonna tire
		of asking me that? No.
		맨날 물어보면서 지겹지도 않아?
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:48	Someone's coming.
		누군가 오고 있소
00:32:49	 
		 
00:33:08	Go.
		가자
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:12	Dr. Steiner?
		Put your hands where I can see 'em!
		스타이너 박사?
		-내가 볼수 있게 손 머리 위로 올려!
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	Hands! Hands in the air!
		I'm not armed.
		손 들어!
		-나는 무기가 없소
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	I'm... I'm not armed.
		I'm not armed.
		난 무기가 없소 난..
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:17	It's the butler! It's the butler!
		It's the butler!
		집사다 집사! 와 정말 집사네! 집사! 집사!
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:19	It's the but... the butler did it!
		I always wanted to say that.
		집사라고 얼마나 말하고 싶었는데 진짜 집사잖아!
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	But wait. It gets better.
		하지만 더 재밌는건 여기지
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:25	Ms. Cook.
		쿡 부인
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:27	Good evening. Remember me?
		I can't hear anything with this.
		멋진 저녁이군요 절 기억하시겠습니까? 이걸 끼고 있어 안 들리네요
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:30	The good doctor here told us
		that Timothy Hartley's murder
		저 멋진 박사님이 티모시 하틀리의 살인범은
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:33	cut himself whilst doing the killing.
		살인 도중에 자기 손을 베었을거라더군요
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:36	Yeah. Would you mind terribly
		showing me your hand?
		그러니 손을 잠깐 보여달라 청하는게 무례가 안될런지?
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:44	Oh.
		아하
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:47	You must let Harrison go.
		해리슨은 가게 놔두시오
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	He has done nothing but serve
		me faithfully and well.
		그는 내게 성실히 봉사했을 뿐 아무 짓도 저지르지 않았소
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	As I explained, ma'am,
		제가 설명드렸다시피
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	Our D.A. Will drop the
		charges against your Butler,
		저희 질문에 성실히 대답해 주시면
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:56	If you answer our questions honestly.
		지방검사가 집사분에 대한 기소를 취하할 겁니다
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:58	I feel like I'm haggling in a
		bazaar over the cost of a rug.
		마치 시장에서 물건을 흥정하는 기분이군
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:03	But if you will release
		Harrison, then I will speak.
		해리슨을 놓아주면 질문에 응하겠소
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	Your son-in-law was about to go public
		사위분이 언론에 공개적으로
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:09	With the whole alien adventure
		thing, wasn't he? More than that.
		외계인과의 신나는 모험을 누설할 작정이었죠?
		-그뿐이겠소
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	He wanted to start a global
		foundation for abductees,
		피랍자들을 도와주고 선전하는
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:17	To see to their needs and
		promote their cause.
		전세계적 재단을 꾸릴 작정이었소
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:20	He was gonna call it The
		Cook Family Foundation.
		그걸 쿡 재단이라 이름붙이려 했지
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:23	Well, that wasn't going to happen.
		결국 무산됐지만
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:26	No, you cannot do this.
		말도 안되네
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:29	I won't allow it.
		It's not something you can stop.
		허락할 수 없어
		-장모님이 싫단다고 그만둘 수 있는 일이 아닙니다
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	Try me. I am not without
		resources, young man.
		덤벼봐, 내게도 수단이 있어
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	But he said he was going to
		use his own money for it.
		그러자 자기 돈으로라도 설립하겠다더군
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:38	And then he said...
		time's on my side, Elspeth.
		그리고는 말했지..
		'시간은 제 편이니까요, 장모님'
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:42	What do you mean, Timothy?!
		뭐라고, 티모시?
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:45	Timothy, come back here!
		티모시! 이리 돌아와!
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:47	I knew what he meant.
		Hartley was going to wait
		그 말은 분명했어
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:49	Until I was dead,
		and then use my money
		내가 죽길 기다려 내 돈을 가지고
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:52	And my daughter to
		turn the Cook name
		또 내 딸과 쿡 가문의 이름을 가지고
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:53	Into an international joke.
		전세계적 조롱거리로 만들겠단 뜻이었지
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:56	So the next time he went to that
		place he was always visiting,
		그래서 항상 가는 그 피랍장소에 가길 기다려
00:34:59	 
		 
00:35:00	We followed.
		뒤를 밟았지
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:09	Why slit Hartley's throat?
		왜 목을 그었습니까?
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:10	That was the telltale sign...
		너무 표가 났지
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:13	A hunter's humanity, if you will.
		사냥꾼의 배려랄까 말하자면
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:17	You learned how to hunt
		and kill at a young age,
		당신은 어릴때 사냥하는 법을 배웠죠,
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	Didn't you, Elspeth?
		엘스벳?
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:22	Your father taught you.
		아버지가 가르쳐 주셨겠죠
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:24	Yes. He was very firm on that point.
		그 점에선 참 엄격하셨다오
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:27	"Never let the animal suffer."
		동물을 고통 속에 오래 놔두지 말라 하셨지
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:30	I got awfully cross with
		Consuela for mislaying this.
		집사를 그것으로 크게 나무랐지
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:35	I shall have to apologize.
		그 점에 관해선 내가 사과해야 해
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:38	Mm.
		흠
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:49	Hey. What's up?
		뭔데?
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:51	There's something I have to
		talk to you about. What's that?
		내가 꼭 말해야 하는게 있어 -뭔데?
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:55	Wayne?
		웨인?
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:57	What is it?
		뭐길래
00:35:58	 
		 
00:36:04	A friend of mine is a ranger
		at Vandermeer State Park,
		내 친구 하나가 Vandermeer State Park에서 산림감시원으로 일해
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:07	And maybe I can get him to give
		you a waiver to get married
		어쩌면 그 친구가 퀘이커 회관을
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	At that quaker meeting house.
		Really?
		대관할 수 있게 도와줄지 몰라
		-정말?
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:12	Yeah. I think. I can try.
		아마도 부탁해 볼게
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:15	Wayne, that's fantastic. Mwah.
		웨인, 어쩜 너무 멋져
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	Thank you so much. Yeah.
		너무 고마워
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:20	I'm gonna call Craig.
		Yeah, okay.
		크레이그한테 얘기해놀게 -그래
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:33	Please.
		들어오시게
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:35	Thank you for coming by.
		들러주어 고맙네
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	Oh, it's no problem.
		뭐 어려운 일이라구요
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:39	Nice place. Tidy.
		멋지군요 정갈하고
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	Thank you.
		고맙네
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:43	Please.
		이쪽으로
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:44	I wanted to tell you
		how much I appreciated
		이번 사건을 같이 수사할 수 있게 해줘서
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:47	Your letting me come along
		on your investigation.
		얼마나 고마운지 몰라
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	It was fun.
		참 재미있었어
00:36:52	 
		 
00:36:52	Hmm, it was fun, wasn't it?
		재밌었죠
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:55	That was my pleasure.
		저 역시 즐거웠습니다
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:57	Thank you.
		고마워
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:58	Um, look... ahh.
		그게 말이야..
00:36:59	 
		 
00:37:01	Won't beat around the bush.
		여러말 않겠네
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:03	About me dying,
		내 몸 말이야
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:06	I-I know what's going to happen now.
		앞으로 어떤 일이 일어날지 알아
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:09	I've seen it.
		많이 봐 왔거든
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	There are no mysteries.
		뻔해
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:12	It's going to get bad...
		상황은 곧..
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:15	Very soon,
		굉장히 나빠질거야
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:17	And then worse.
		점점 더 나빠지겠지
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:19	And I have no interest
		그리고 난
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:20	In letting nature take its course.
		그걸 마냥 지켜보고 싶진 않다네
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:23	You understand?
		알아 듣겠나?
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:25	Uh, yes.
		아, 네
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	You, uh, you want to kill yourself.
		스스로 목숨을 끊으려 하시는군요
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:29	In a nutshell.
		이 집에서
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:32	I have pills I can take.
		내가 쓸 약도 가지고 있네
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:35	The problem is,
		문제는,
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:38	If there is an unexplained death,
		내 시신이 집에서
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:40	If a body is found in an apartment,
		변사체로 발견되면
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	There is an investigation, an autopsy.
		수사가 개시될테고 검시도 있을테고
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	Mm.
		 
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	And the idea of being examined,
		검시당한다는게 참..
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:51	Of being a body on the...
		내 몸이
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:53	On the table...
		검시 테이블에 올라간다는건..
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:58	But if the death is witnessed
		by a law enforcement officer,
		하지만 경찰이 목격자가 되어 준다면
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	No investigation is required.
		수사는 개시되지 않고 끝나
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:06	I'm not a law enforcement officer.
		전 경찰이 아닌데요
00:38:09	 
		 
00:38:11	You're close enough, I think.
		자네 자격이면 충분해
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:14	I don't know that I can do
		it, that I can witness that.
		제가 그걸.. 해드릴 수 있을지 모르겠어요
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:21	I'm not even sure that killing
		yourself is the best idea.
		솔직히 지금 하시는 말씀이 최선인가도 모르겠습니다
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:26	It's what I'm going to do.
		하지만 내가 하려는 일이지
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:31	Well, that's your choice.
		선택은 본인의 몫이겠지요
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:34	But, uh...
		하지만 그..
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:41	I understand. I...
		이해하네
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:43	I'm sorry.
		미안하네
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:45	This was a t...
		이건 참..
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	Terrible imposition.
		말도 안되는 폐를 끼치려 했군
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	I-I shouldn't have.
		말을 꺼내질 말았어야 했는데
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:51	Please.
		Forget I said anything.
		미안해 말한건 잊어주게
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:54	I'm sorry.
		참 미안해
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:58	Do you have any tea?
		집에 차 좀 있으세요?
00:38:59	 
		 
00:39:02	Yes, I do.
		있어
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	I could really use a cup of tea.
		차를 워낙이 좋아해서요
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	Okay.
		그래
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:09	Sure.
		그럼
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:13	Uh...
		음..
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	There's cookies in the cupboard. Yeah.
		쿠키는 찬장에 있고
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:17	Uh... uh, would you like a cup?
		잔을 써도 되겠지요?
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:19	Thank you. Yeah.
		물론이지
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:21	Well, uh, I'm going in
		the other room now.
		나는 다른 방에 들렀다가
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:26	I'll be a few minutes.
		곧 돌아오겠네
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	Yeah. Take your time.
		그렇게 하세요
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:51	Here.
		여기
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:56	Mmm.
		 
00:39:57	 
		 
00:40:08	The note in the
		dead man's... pocket...
		시신 바지 주머니에 쪽지..
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	You... you had an arrangement
		그거 보안관하고 미리
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:14	With the deputy, didn't you?
		짠거지.. 그렇지?
00:40:15	 
		 
00:40:18	Yes, I did.
		그랬어요
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:22	I knew it.
		그럴줄 알았어
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:23	Yeah.
		 
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:24	It's an old carny magic trick.
		흔해빠진 마술 트릭이죠
00:40:26	 
		 
00:40:28	You did magic?
		마술할 줄 아나?
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:30	Oh, yeah.
		그럼요
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:32	I first started out,
		uh, working close-up
		카드와 동전 같은걸로 하는
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:34	With, uh, cards and coins.
		막간 쇼부터 시작해 일했거든요
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:38	Really?
		정말인가?
00:40:39	 
		 
00:40:39	Yeah. I'll show you.
		보여드리죠
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:43	Got a coin in here.
		동전이 여기 있을텐데
00:40:44	 
		 
00:40:44	Yeah. Okay.
		그렇지
00:40:46	 
		 
00:40:47	See that coin?
		동전이 보이시죠?
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:49	It's there, right?
		여기 있지 않습니까?
00:40:51	 
		 
00:40:54	And it's gone.
		사라졌네요
00:40:54	 
		 
00:40:55	It's there...
		여기 있다가...
00:40:56	 
		 
00:40:59	Then it's gone.
		사라집니다
00:41:00	 
		 
00:41:02	Amazing.
		대단하군
00:41:03	 
		 
00:41:03	It's really quite simple.
		아주 간단한 거예요
00:41:04	 
		 
00:41:05	It's there...
		여기 있다가..
00:41:06	 
		 
00:41:08	And then it's gone.
		사라집니다
00:41:09	 
		 
00:41:10	Patrick...
		패트릭,
00:41:11	 
		 
00:41:14	Thank you.
		고마워
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:15	Just watch the coin.
		동전만 보고 계세요
00:41:17	 
		 
00:41:18	And it's gone.
		사라집니다
00:41:19	 
		 
00:41:23	It's there...
		있다가..
00:41:23	 
		 
00:41:27	And then it's gone.
		사라지죠
