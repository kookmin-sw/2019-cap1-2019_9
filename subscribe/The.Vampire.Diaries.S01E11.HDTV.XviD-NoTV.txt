00:08:41	Good. Yeah
		잘됐네
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:44	Are you back in school?
		다시 학교 다니는거야?
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	No. Actually I came here to find you.
		아니, 사설 널 찾으러
		여기까지 왔어
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	I s hoping you could help
		me with something. A spell.
		네가 도와줄수 없을까 해서
		주문을 말이지
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:53	Stefan, look, I know elena's
		ok with all of this,
		스테판, 엘레나도
		다 이해하는거 알고
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	And I appreciate what
		you did to help me.
		네가 날 도우려 했던거
		정말 고맙게 생각해
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	But I'm not really ready to
		dive into it with you just yet.
		하지만 아직 너와 같이
		그 일에 뛰어들 준비가 안됐어
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	I understand. But I need your he.
		이해해. 하지만
		네 도움이 필요해
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	It's elena. She's with damon.
		엘레나 때문이야
		데이먼하고 같이 있대
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:10	I have elena's necklace.
		I was just hoping you could e this
		엘레나 목걸이를 가지고 있어
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	To make some sort of a connection.
		네가 이 목걸이로
		통신을 할 수 없을까 싶어서
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	I just neeto know that she's ok.
		괜찮은지만 알면 돼
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	How do you know I can do this?
		내가 할 수 있을지
		어떻게 알아?
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	Because I've known a few
		witches over the years.
		지난 몇년간 알고 지낸
		마녀들이 있었거든
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	I've seen what they can do.
		그들의 능력을 보았지
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	I'm still new at it.
		아직 익숙치가 않아
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	It's ok.
		괜찮아
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	Give it a shot.
		한번 시도 해보는거야
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	Ok.
		좋아
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	All right.
		알았어
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:40	There's nothing.
		아무것도 안보여
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	Nothing's happening.
		Usually there's an image or...
		아무것도 안 생기네
		보통 이미지가 떠오르거나..
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:47	Tell me if anyone's looking.
		누구 보는 사람 없나 봐줘
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	Ok.
		알았어
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	All right.
		좋아
00:09:51	 
		 
00:10:11	What is it?
		그게 뭐야?
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	Something's wrong. With elena?
		- 뭔가 잘못됐어
		- 엘레나가?
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	With me. There's
		something wrong with me.
		내가. 내가 뭔가 잘못됐다고
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	I have to go. I'm sorry, stefan.
		가봐야겠어
		미안해, 스테판
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	I can't hp you.
		널 도와줄 수 없어
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:26	So, where's my car?
		그럼 내 차 어디있는 거죠?
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:29	I pulled it off on the side of the road.
		도로 옆으로 밀어놨어
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	I don't think anyone will bother it.
		아무도 신경 안쓸거야
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	At about that man in the road?
		그 도로 한복판에
		서있던 남자는요?
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:35	Was he a...?
		그 사람도...?
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	From what I could tell. Yeah.
		내가 아는 바론
		맞을 거야
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	You don't kn him?
		몰라요?
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	If I've never met him,
		I wouldn't know him.
		못 만나봤으니 모르지
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	I mean, it's not like we all hang out
		together at the vamp bar and grill.
		뱀파이어들만 모이는 장소가
		따로 있는 것도 아니고
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:53	You brought me to a bar?
		여기가 어디죠?
		술집에 데려온 거에요?
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	Damon, I'm not old enough.
		They're not going to let me in.
		데이먼, 난 미성년자에요
		안 들여보내 줄거라구요
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	Sure they will.
		들여주고 말구
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	[hands clap]
		 
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:05	[music playing]
		 
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:10	No. No, it can't be.
		말도 안돼
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	Damon.
		데이먼
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:21	My honey pie.
		우리 자기가 왔네
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:32	Listen up everybody!
		모두들 잘 들어요!
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:33	Here's to the man that broke my heart,
		내 마음을 아프게 하고
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	Crushed my soul,
		내 영혼을 부수고
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	Destroyed my life,
		내 인생을 파멸하고
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:39	And ruined any and all
		chances of happiness!
		행복의 기회를 모두
		짓밟아버린 남자를 위하여!
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:44	Drink up!
		다 마셔!
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:49	Ahh. Whoo!
		 
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:51	So, how'd he rope you in?
		데이먼이 어떻게 꼬신거죠?
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	I'm not roped in.
		Actually, I'm dating his--
		꼬신게 아녜요
		난 사실 이쪽..
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	Honey, if you're not roped,
		you're whipped.
		꼬인게 아니면
		세뇌당한 거군요
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Either way, just eoy the ride.
		어쨌든 즐겨요
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	Ok.
		알았어요
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	So, how did you two meet?
		그럼 두분 어떻게 만난거죠?
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	College.
		대학교에서
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	You went to college?
		대학을 다녔어요?
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	I've been on a college campus, yes.
		대학 캠퍼스는 누벼봤지
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	About 20 years ago, when I was
		just a sweet, young freshman.
		20년 전에 난 아주 상냥하고
		어린 신입생이었는데
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	I met this butiful man,
		and fell in love.
		이 멋진 남자를 만나
		사랑에 빠졌죠
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	And then he told me
		about his littleecret,
		그 후 그는 자신의
		작은 비밀을 알려줬고
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	Made me love himore.
		난 더 사랑에 빠져 버렸죠
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	Because, you see,
		I had a little secret of my own
		왜냐면, 나한테도
		작은 비밀이 있었거든요
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	That I was dying to share with somebody.
		아무에게도 말 못하고 있던 비밀
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	She's a witch.
		마녀에요
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:28	Changed my world.
		내 세상을 바꿔놨죠
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	I rocked your world.
		흔들어 놓은 거겠지
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	He is good in the sack, isn't he?
		침실에선 잘하죠?
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	But mostly he's just a walkawayoe.
		하지만 대부분
		떠돌이 생활을 하죠
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:41	So, what is it that you want?
		근데 원하는 게 뭐야?
00:12:46	 
		 
00:13:18	Oh my god. I am so sorry.
		이런. 정말 미안해
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	There was this one book
		wedged between the other.
		사이에 껴있는
		책이 있어서
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	And I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom.
		그걸 뽑았더니
		우루루 떨어졌네
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	Yeah, I'm fine.
		응, 괜찮아
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:33	Ohh!
		 
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:38	I'm anna.
		난 애나야
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	I'm jeremy.
		제레미야
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:56	Thank god you're back.
		할머니가 오셔서 다행이에요
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	And hello to you, too.
		What's the matter?
		너도 잘 있었지
		무슨 일이냐?
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	Powers are gone, grams.
		I can't do anything,
		제 능력이 사라졌어요
		아무 것도 못해요
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	Even when I concentrate.
		집중을 할 때도
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	And there's nothing in
		in any of these books
		이 책들을 봐도
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	That can tell me how to get them back.
		능력을 되찾는 법은
		써있지가 않아요
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	Hang on, now. Just calm down.
		잠깐 진정 좀 해보렴
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:13	Tell me what happened.
		무슨 일이 있었는지 말해보거라
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	I can't.
		말 못해요
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	We keeping secrets now?
		이젠 말 못한 비밀이 생긴거야?
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	I have to. I'm sorry. I promised.
		비밀을 지켜야만 해요
		미안해요. 약속했단 말예요
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	Please help me.
		제발 도와줘요
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:29	Well, first of all, there's nothing
		in any of these that's gonna help you.
		우선 이런 책들은
		널 절대 돕지 못한다
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	If you're blocked, it's in here.
		네 능력이 막혔다면
		다 네 안에 있는거야
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	You gotta clear it out,
		then you're back in business.
		그것들을 비워내면
		다시 돌아갈 수 있을거다
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:39	Clear what out?
		비워내라구요?
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	Whatever's got you so scared.
		널 두렵게 한게
		뭐든지 말이다
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:46	Hi, jenna. I'm so sorry.
		제나 이모
		정말 미안해
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	Where are you? Why didn't you call?
		어디 있어?
		왜 전화 안했니?
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	I was so tired last night.
		I fell asleep at bonnie's.
		어젯밤에 너무 피곤해서
		보니네 집에서 잤어
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	And then this morning,
		I just wanted to get to school.
		근데 아침에 바로
		학교 가고 싶어지더라고
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:58	Are you ok?
		괜찮니?
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	You know, stefan and stuff.
		알잖아, 스테판 일 때문에
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:06	Come on, there's gotta b another way.
		다른 방법이 있을거야
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	After all these years,
		it's still only katherine.
		수십년이 지나도
		캐더린 뿐이구나
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	How do you even know she's still alive?
		살아있을지
		어떻게 아는거야?
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	Well, you help me get into
		that tomb and we'll find out.
		묘지로 가는 방법을
		알려주면 알게될거야
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	I already did. 20 years ago. Remember?
		이미 알려줬잖아
		20년 전에. 기억 안나?
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	3 easy steps--
		세 단계면 되지
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	Comet. Crystal. Spell.
		혜성. 수정구슬. 주문
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:26	There's a little problem with number 2.
		두번째 단계에
		문제가 있어
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	I don't have the crystal.
		수정구슬이 없단거
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	That's it, damon. There is no other way.
		It's emily's spell.
		그럼 끝이네. 다른 방법이 없어
		에밀리의 주문이라
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	What about a new spell
		에밀리의 능력을 뛰어넘는
		새 수정과 새 주문을 건다면?
00:15:36	 
		에밀리의 능력을 뛰어넘는
		새 수정과 새 주문을 건다면?
00:15:36	With a new crystal that
		overrides emily's spell?
		에밀리의 능력을 뛰어넘는
		새 수정과 새 주문을 건다면?
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	It doesn't work that way, baby.
		그건 전혀 불가능해
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	Emily's spell is absolute.
		You can't get into that tomb.
		에밀리의 주문은 절대적이야
		무덤 안에 들어갈 수 없어
00:15:45

		보니 아버님이

00:19:18	And yet you offered me your hand,
		하지만 자넨
		손을 내밀었어
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Which means you wanted me
		to see that I can trust you.
		내가 자넬 믿을 수 있나
		보고 싶었던 게지
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	Can you?
		절 믿으시겠나요?
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:27	I ust you'll keep her safe.
		자네가 지켜줄 거란건 믿네
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	You'd better be on your way, then.
		그럼 혼자 찾아보도록 하게
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	I'm not going to invite you in.
		안으로 초대는 안할테니
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	I'm sure you understand why.
		이유는 자네도 잘 알테지
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:41	This aisle is local and state history.
		이 구역은 지역
		역사 관련 서적들이 있어
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	And civil war is one over.
		남북전쟁은 그 다음 구역에 있지
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	What do you need?
		뭐가 필요한데?
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	Local. 1860s. Do you work here?
		1860년대 지역 역사
		여기서 일하니?
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	Nope. You want reference. This way.
		아니. 참조 자료가
		필요하구나. 이쪽이야
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	Uh, home-schooled. I study here
		for a moc school environment.
		홈스쿨 하고 있어. 학교 환경을
		흉내내려 여기서 공부해
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	Ah, here we go.
		여기 있네
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Original settlers, town archives,
		founders stuff. It's all here.
		초기 정착자, 지역 문서들
		설립자 문서들. 다 여기 있어
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	So, what's your topi
		주제가 뭔데?
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:05	The town's fear and
		hysteria surrounding the war
		우리 동네의 전쟁을
		둘러싼 공포와 흥분
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	And how it influenced
		certain writers of the time.
		그게 특정 시대의 작가에
		어떻게 영향을 줬는지에 대해서
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:11	You might want to focus that.
		거기 초점을 두는게 좋을걸
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	The origin of local folklore and myths.
		우리 지역 민간 전승과
		전설의 기원 말야
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	You mean the vampires?
		뱀파이어 말이지?
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:20	Let's just say that I'm
		descended from katherine--
		캐더린의 후손이라고 치죠
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	Does that make me part vampire?
		그럼 난 뱀파이어 피가
		섞여있는 건가요?
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	Vampires can't procreate.
		뱀파이어는 자손을 못 낳아
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	But we love to try.
		시도하는 건 좋아하지만
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	No.
		 
00:20:30	No.
		아니
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	If you are related,
		it would mean katherine had a child
		둘 사이에 관계가 있다면
		캐더린에게 아이가 있었던거지
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	Before she was turned.
		뱀파이어가 되기 전에
		생긴 아이
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:37	Did stefan think that he
		could use me to replace her?
		스테판은 캐더린을 대신해
		날 이용할 생각이었나요?
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	Kinda creepy if you ask me.
		나도 솔직히 오싹해
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:44	Come on, what? You don't like pickl?
		피클 안좋아해?
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	What's wrong with you?
		뭐가 잘못된거죠?
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	How can you even eat?
		어떻게 음식을 먹을수 있죠?
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	If technically you're supposed to be--
		말 그대로 당신은..
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	Dead.
		죽었단 말이지
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	It's not such a bad word.
		그리 기분 나쁜 단어는 아냐
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	As long as I keep a healthy
		diet of blood in my system,
		내 체내에 혈액을
		충분히 공급해주면
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	Our dy functions pretty normally.
		우리 몸은 정상적으로 작동해
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	This nice act. Is any of it real?
		이런 친절한 행동
		진심이 하나도 있나요?
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:10	Bree: Here you go, honey.
		여기 있어
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:12	Thank you.
		고마워
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:13	I'll have one too.
		나도 한 병 마실게요
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:16	Hmm?
		 
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	Time out, remember? For 5 minutes?
		5분간 휴식하기로
		했던거 기억 안나요?
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Yeah, well that 5 minutes
		is going to need a beer.
		그 5분을 맥주에
		써야 겠어요
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:24	There you go.
		여기 있어요
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:32	You're kidding me, right?
		There's no such thing as vampires.
		농담하는 거지?
		뱀파이어 같은 건 없어
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	Well, there's not a lot of documentation
		문서로 남은 건 별로 없지만
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	But the stories have been
		told since the civil war.
		남북전쟁 이후로
		많은 이야기가 내려져왔어
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	My granddad used to tell me all these
		creepy stories when I was little.
		할아버지는 어릴때
		정말 무서운 얘기들을 해줬어
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	And he said that his
		granddad told them to him.
		증조 할아버지가
		해줬던 얘기랬어
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	Yeah. That would be folklore.
		그래. 그건 민간 전승이지
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:48	Vampires are a metaphor
		for the demons of the day.
		뱀파이어는 그 당시의
		악마를 은유했던 거야
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	Which are?
		그게 뭔데?
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:52	The union soldiers.
		I've read the stories myself.
		연방군 말야
		내가 직접 읽었어
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:54	They talk about the enemy,
		the demons that attack night.
		적들에 대해 얘기하지
		밤에 공격했던 악마들을
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	That sounds like vampires to me.
		난 그게 뱀파이어 얘기처럼 들리는데
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	Allegorical vampires.
		Which is what it is.
		뱀파이어에 비유한거지
		그게 다야
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	Creative expression during
		a very volatile time.
		상황이 격한 시대에
		할수 있는 창조적 표현이지
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	I mean, a couny at war
		doesn't want realism.
		전쟁 중인 나라 사람들은
		사실주의를 원하지 않아
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	They want fantasy.
		Thus, vampire fiction.
		판타지를 원하지
		그래서 뱀파이어가 탄생한거야
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:12	Man, you're smart.
		정말 똑똑하시네
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	I gotta give it to you.
		When I first saw you, I missed it.
		솔직히 말할게. 너를
		보고 나서 책을 놓쳤어
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:19	Yeah. I've had a rough go of it lately.
		난 요즘에 좀 방황했었는데
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	But I'm just now getting
		back to my old self.
		내 예전 모습으로
		돌아오고 있어
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:27	Well, good luck on the paper.
		I gotta get home.
		과제 잘 되길 빌어
		집에 가봐야겠다
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	You know, my great grandfather
		actually showed me a journal once
		있지, 증조 할아버지가
		한번 일기를 보여주셨어
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:35	Of an ancestor and he had written all
		of this creepy stuff about vampires.
		뱀파이어에 대한 오싹한
		이야기를 쓰셨던 조상분 일기를
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:39	It was actually really believable.
		사실 정말 믿음직스러운 이야기였어
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	Wait. A journal?
		잠깐만. 일기라고?
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	Yeah? Why?
		응. 왜?
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:44	Are you sure you have to go?
		지금 꼭 가야하니?
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	[cell phone beeps]
		 
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:53	Come on, phone!
		제발, 연결 되라!
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	[cell phone beeping]
		 
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	Great! Great.
		아주 잘됐네
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:23	[rumbling]
		 
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:28	[screaming]
		 
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:33	Bonnie! Get away from me!
		보니!
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	It's me. It's stefan.
		나야. 스테판
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:36	Stefan.
		스테판
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	The ground gave way and I fell.
		땅이 꺼져서 떨어졌어
00:23:39	 
		땅이 꺼져서 떨어졌어
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:40	It's ok. It's ok. Calm down.
		괜찮아. 진정해
00:23:42	 
		 
00:23:42	Come on, let's get you out of here.
		어서, 밖으로 나가게 해줄게
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	How?
		어떻게?
00:23:45	 
		 
00:23:46	Just close your eyes.
		눈을 감아봐
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:49	Trust .
		믿어
00:23:51	 
		 
00:24:06	You can open your eyes now.
		이젠 떠도 돼
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:07	Whoa.
		 
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:10	I didn't want to scare you.
		겁주려던 의도는 아녔어
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	How did you know where I was?
		내가 어디있는지 어떻게 알았어?
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:12	Well, your grandmother told
		me what you were doing.
		할머님이 네가
		어떤지 얘기해줬어
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	I guessed the where.
		네 위치를 눈치챘지
00:24:16	 
		 
00:24:18	I heard them.
		그들 소리를 들었어
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	Down there. Behind the door.
		저 아래. 문 뒤에
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:25	Are they in pain?
		고통스러워 하고 있을까?
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	In the beginning--yes. But not anymore.
		처음에는 고통스러웠겠지만
		더이상은 아냐
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	They've been starved to
		the point of dessication.
		이젠 뼈가 마를 정도로
		굶은 상태니까
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	But if they have blood--
		하지만 피가 있으면..
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	That's not going to happen, bonnie.
		그럴 일은 없어
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	They can't get out.
		밖으로 나올 수 없지
00:24:36	 
		 
00:24:36	Emily saw to that when she
		had you destroy the crystal.
		수정을 파괴시키도록 시켰을때
		에밀리가 처리했어
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	You're safe.
		넌 안전해
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:43	Ready...Go!
		준비.. 땅!
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:49	That's 3.
		3잔째네요
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	Do you need a bib?
		턱받이라도 필요해요?
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:53	Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw
		like a snake to consume alcohol.
		뱀처럼 턱 벌리고
		술 먹지 못해서 미안
00:24:57	 
		 
00:24:57	Whatever. All right. Who's next?
		아무렴요
		다음 타자는 누구죠?
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:00	Another round, bree.
		한 판 더하죠
00:25:02	 
		 
00:25:02	Honey, you should be on the floor.
		아가씨 무대에 올라가는 게 어때
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	I am not even drunk.
		My tolerance is, like, way up here.
		난 취하지 않았어요
		제 주량은 저 위라구요
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:12	Bree: All right. Here you go.
		좋아요. 시작
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:23	Jeremy: So, you have no
		idea where the journal is?
		일기가 어디있는지 알아?
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	Nope. Gramps died.
		아니. 조부모님들이 돌아가시고
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	And all the kids split
		his stuff. I can ask.
		다들 유품을 분배해 가져가서
		원하면 물어볼 수 있어
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:30	I just find it weird that our ancestors
		kept the same kind of journal.
		조상들이 비슷한 종류의
		일기를 썼다니 이상해
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	It's crazy.
		말도 안되지
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:35	Maybe it's based in
		some partial reality.
		부분적으로 현실에
		근거한 걸 수도 있잖아
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:38	No. It's gotta be a metaphorical.
		아니. 은유적인게 틀림없어
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	My ancestor wrote short stories.
		우리 집안 조상은
		단편 소설을 썼단말야
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:41	So, that's why you're hung
		up on the fiction of it all.
		그래서 네가 소설에
		목을 매는 거구나
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:44	No, I'm hung up on fiction of it all
		내가 소설에 목을 매는 건
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:46	Because I've seen "the lost boys"
		'로스트 보이'랑
		(고전 뱀파이어 영화)
00:25:47	 
		 
00:25:48	And "near dark," like, 50 times.
		'죽음의 키스'를
		50번도 넘게 봐서야
		(고전 뱀파이어 영화)
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	Are those movies?
		영화 이름이니?
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:52	Hey. I've never seen them.
		한번도 못봤단 말야
00:25:54	 
		 
00:25:54	Maybe we can have a fright night
		우리 '공포의 밤'을 갖는게 어때
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	And rent a whole bunch
		of vampire movies.
		뱀파이어 영화를
		잔뜩 빌려 보는거지
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:00	Uh, yeah, sure.
		그래도 되고
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	Why does tt sound like a no way in hell?
		왜 절대 안된다는 소리로 들리지?
00:26:08	 
		 
00:26:08	Sorry, I'm blunt.
		미안, 내가 너무 솔직했지
00:26:11	 
		 
00:26:11	No, it's--I don't want you
		to get the wrong idea.
		아니.. 네가 오해하지
		않았으면 좋겠어
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	I just recently got out of something,
		최근에 큰 일이 좀 있어서
00:26:17	 
		 
00:26:17	It's a little too soon, you know?
		너무 이르거든
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	Oh please, sure. No worries.
		당연히 괜찮지
		걱정 마
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	I meant as friends. Yeah.
		친구로서 물어봤던 건데
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	Look, I really gotta go.
		그럼 가봐야겠다
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:31	Nice meeting you, jeremy.
		만나서 반가웠어, 제레미
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:42	[cell phone ringing] yeah!
		 
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:49	Hello? Jenna?
		여보세요? 이모?
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Hold on, it's loud in here.
		잠깐만. 여기 너무 시끄러워서
00:26:54	Hold on, it's loud in here.
		엘레나, 어디야?
		너 괜찮은거니?
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:56	Huh? Yeah. No, I'm good.
		응. 괜찮아
00:26:58	 
		 
00:26:58	Eveything's fine. Hold on.
		I can't hear you.
		다 괜찮아
		잠깐만. 안들려
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:08	Hello?
		여보세요?
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	[mumbling]
		 
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:17	Hey, where's your girl?
		엘레나는 어디 있어?
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	Hmm.
		 
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:21	She was right back there.
		저 뒤쪽에 있었는데
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:54	Damon, no.
		데이먼, 그러지 마요!
00:27:55	 
		 
00:28:03	What t hell?!
		대체 뭐야?
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:07	No!
		안돼요!
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:16	Who are you?
		넌 누구야?
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:18	That's pfect. You have no idea.
		아주 대단해
		아예 모르신다
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	What are you talking aut?
		What did he do?
		무슨 말씀이세요?
		뭘 했길래요?
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:23	He killed my girlfriend.
		이 녀석이

		그렇게 죽이는 거야?
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	Nothing.
		아무것도
00:28:35	 
		 
00:28:35	Elena: I don't understand.
		이해가 안가요
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:38	My girlfriend went to visit sfan,

00:28:57	 
		 
00:29:05	Lexi turned you?
		렉시가 만들어줬나요?

		물러날수 없다고 했죠
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:24	Well, that's a choice you're

		그 선택은 내가 해
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:27	Don't. Don't, please, don't hurt him--
		그러지 마요. 제발

		좋은 분이란 거죠
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:42	Be better than him.

00:30:54	You're welcome, sheila.
		천만에요, 실리아
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:58	I wasn't sure you remembered.
		기억하는 줄 몰랐었는데
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	October 1969.
		1969년 10월이었죠
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	I was barely a teenager.
		제가 갓 열살이 되었을 거에요
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	And you were leading what was probably
		할머님은 그 당시에 아마
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	The only anti-war si
		t-in within miles of mystic falls.
		동네 주변의 유일한
		전쟁 반대 시위자였잖아요
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:11	Hmm.
		 
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:12	You knowwhen you spoke,
		people were mesmerized.
		당신의 이야기로
		사람들을 매료시켰죠
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:16	I know I was.
		나도 알아
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:18	Until the cops showed up.
		그리곤 경찰이 들이 닥쳤지
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:22	You took a big risk
		coming to see me earlier.
		아까 날 보러 오는
		큰 위험을 무릅썼지
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	Letting me read you,
		realize who you were.
		자네의 존재를 깨닫게
		날 이끌었잖나
00:31:27	 
		 
00:31:27	It could have gone a
		completely different way.
		일이 잘못됐을 수도 있는데 말이네
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:30	Your familhas a very long
		history of keeping my secret.
		할머님의 집안은 오랫동안
		제 비밀을 지켜주셨잖아요
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	I knew that I could trust you if you
		believed I waworthy of your trust.
		당신의 신뢰를 얻을만하다
		믿으면 될 줄 알았어요
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:41	Bonnie knows, doesn't she?
		보니도 아나?
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:45	Yes.
		네
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	Please understand,
		our loyalty can only extend so far.
		제발 이해해주게. 우리가
		여기까지 온 건 행운이란걸
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:51	This town won't be easy on any
		of us if they figure it out.
		그들이 알아차리면 동네 사람들이
		우리를 가만두지 않을거네
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:55	And I'll protect my own
		before anybody else.
		그런 일이 생기면
		난 내 가문만을 지킬게고
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	I know that.
		알아요
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	As long as we're clear
		확실히 알아들은 것 같으니
00:32:03	 
		 
00:32:05	Goodnight, then.

00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	Goodnight, sheila.
		잘 있어요, 실리아
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:21	We were just leaving,

		이제 곧 떠날 거라
		작별 인사 하고 싶었어
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:24	Good to see you again, damon.
		다시 만나서 기뻐, 데이먼
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:29	No ks?
		키스 안해줘?
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	I'm full of vervain.
		내 몸속엔 마편초로
		꽉 차 있어
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:33	I put it in everything I drink.
		내가 마시는 모든 음료에 넣으니까
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	And you're telling me this why?
		그걸 얘기하는 이유는?
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	Lexi was my friend.
		렉시는 내 친구였어
00:32:40	 
		 
00:32:40	How could you?
		어떻게 그럴수 있는거지?
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:46	The tomb can be opened.
		묘지를 열 수 있어
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	You're lying!
		거짓말 하지마!
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	Emily's grimoire, her spellbook.
		에밀리의 주문책에 말야
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:52	If you know how she closed the tomb
		그 묘지를 어떻게
		봉인했는지 알면
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	The reversal process will be in
		her book. You can open that tomb.
		반대의 과정도 책에
		있을거야. 열 수 있는거지
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	D where is this book?
		그 책이 어디있는데?
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	I--I--
		난..
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	You have no idea.
		전혀 모르는군
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	No. I'm telling you the truth.
		아니. 사실을 말하는 거야
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:03	And I believe you.
		널 믿어
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	My dear, sweet bree.
		나의 달콤한 브리
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:09	That's why I'm almost sorry.
		이래서 내가 좀 미안하단 거야
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:11	Ugh!
		 
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:37	So, why did you bring me with you?
		왜 날 데려갔던 거죠?
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:40	Wellyou're not the worst
		company in the world, elena.
		친구로 데려가기
		그리 나쁘지 않거든, 엘레나
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	You ould give yourself more credit.
		자신을 너무 과소평가 하지마
00:33:46	 
		 
00:33:46	Seriously?
		진짜요?
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	You were there in the road.
		All damsel in distress-like.
		그 도로 한복판에
		곤경에 처한채 쓰러져 있었잖아
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	And I knew it would piss off stefan.
		스테판을 열받게
		하리란 것도 알았고
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	And...
		그리고..
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:56	U're not the worst company
		in the world, elena.
		같이 데려가기 그리
		나쁘진 않거든
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:02	I used to be more fun.
		예전엔 나도
		더 재미있는 사람이었어요
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:04	You did ok.
		괜찮았어
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	I saved your life.
		내가 당신 목숨을 구해줬잖아요
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:10	I know.
		알아
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:12	And don't you forget it.
		절대 잊지 마요
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:27	[footsteps approaching]
		 
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:31	Hi.
		안녕
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	Hi.
		안녕
00:34:33	 
		 
00:34:36	You coulhave told me.
		미리 말해줄 수 있었잖아
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	I wanted to tell you.
		말하고 싶었어
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	You said no more lies. Only the truth.
		더이상 거짓말 않기로
		진실만 얘기하겠다 했잖아
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:43	I can handle the truth, stefan.
		나도 진실을 감당할 수 있어
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	As crazy as it is,
		미친 것 처럼 보이지만
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	I can handle the fact
		that you are a vampire.
		뱀파이어란 사실도
		감당할 수 있었다고
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	D you have a vampire brother.
		네게 뱀파이어 형도 있고
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:54	And that my best friend is a witch.
		내 단짝 친구가
		마녀라는 사실도 말야
00:34:57	 
		 
00:34:57	I can accept the fact that the
		world is much more mysterious place
		내가 가능하지 않다 생각했던
		일들이 펼쳐지는
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	Than I ever thought possible.
		신비로운 세상이란
		사실도 인정해
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	But this--this lie, I can't take.
		하지만 이런 거짓말은
		감당할 수 없어
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	What am I to you?
		난 네게 어떤 존재니?
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	Who am I to you?
		넌 날 누구로 보냐고?
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	You are not katherine.
		넌 캐더린이 아냐
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	You are the opposite
		everything that she was.
		넌 그녀의 정반대지
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	And when did you figure that out?
		그걸 언제 알게 된거야?
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	Before you kissed me?
		키스하기 전에?
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	Before we slept together?
		같이 자기 전에?
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:26	Before I met you.
		널 만나기 전에
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	What?
		뭐라고?
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	The first day of school. We when met.
		개학 첫날 만났었잖아
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	It wasn't for the first time, elena.
		널 본게 처음이 아녔어
00:35:39	 
		 
00:35:41	Then when was it?
		그럼 언제였는데?
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:43	May 23, 2009.
		2009년 5월 23일
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	But that was--
		하지만 그 날은..
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	That was the day your parents'
		car went off the bridge.
		너희 부모님 차가
		다리 밖으로 추락했던 날이지
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:54	You were the?
		네가?
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:56	Every couple of years
		that I come back here
		1,2년 마다 한번씩
		이 곳에 돌아와
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	To see zach and see my home.
		삼촌하고 고향집을 찾아서
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:02	Last spring, I was out in the woods,
		by old wickery bridge.
		작년 봄에 오래된 수문교 쪽
		숲속에 있었어
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	And I heard the accident. All of it.
		사고 소리를 들었지
		모두 다
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	I was fast getting there,
		but not fast enough.
		재빨리 그곳에 갔는데
		그다지 빠르진 못했지
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	The car was already submerged.
		이미 차가 물 속에
		가라 앉은 상태였어
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:22	Your dad was still-
		he was still conscious.
		네 아버지는..
		아직 의식이 있으셨고
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	I was able to get to him,
		그를 끌어낼 수 있었는데
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	But he wouldn't let me help
		him until I helped you.
		널 구하기 전까지는
		자긴 꺼내지 말라고 하셨어
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:32	Oh my god.
		세상에
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:38	When I woke up in the hospital,
		병원에서 깨어났을 때
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:40	Nobody could figure out
		how I got out of the car.
		내가 어떻게 차밖으로 나왔는지
		아무도 이해하지 못했어
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	They said it was a miracle.
		다들 기적이랬어
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:48	I went back for them.
		But it was too late.
		다시 그분들을 구하러 갔는데
		너무 늦은 후였어
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:51	I couldn't--
		난..
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	I couldn't save them.
		그 분들을 살리지 못했지
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	When I pulled you out,
		I looked at your face.
		날 꺼내줬을 때
		네 얼굴을 봤어
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:00	You looked like katherine.
		I couldn't believe the resemblance.
		캐더린하고 닮은거야
		너무 똑같아 믿을 수 없었지
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	After that, I spent months
		making sure th you weren't her.
		그후에 몇달 동안
		네가 캐더린이 아니란걸 확인했지
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:07	I watched you. I learned
		everythi that I could about you.
		널 지켜봤어. 너에 대한
		모든 걸 배워봤고
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:11	And I saw that you were
		nothing like katherine.
		그리고 네가 캐더린과
		전혀 다르단 걸 알게된거야
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:14	And I wanted to leave town,
		but, elena, I couldn't.
		난 동네를 떠나고 싶었지만
		떠날 수 없었어
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:19	I couldn't leave without knowing you.
		널 알기 전까지는
		떠날 수 없었어
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:22	I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.
		말 안 해줘서
		정말 미안해
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	I wanted to. But you were so sad.
		하고 싶었지만
		네가 너무 슬퍼 보여서
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:33	Why do I look like her?
		난 왜 그녀와 닮은 걸까?
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:38	Elena, you've been thrgh so much.
		엘레나, 넌 많은 일을 겪어냈어
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	Why do I look like her,
		stefan? What are you not telling me?
		왜 비슷하게 생긴거야 스테판?
		뭘 말 안해주는 건데?
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:44	It didn't make any sense me.
		나도 전혀 이해가 안됐어
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	You were a gilbert. She was a pierce.
		넌 성이 길버트고
		그녀는 성이 피어스였으니까
00:37:49	 
		 
00:37:50	But the resemblance was too similar.
		하지만 너무 많이 닮았지
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	And then I learned the truth.
		그러다 사실을 알게 되었어
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:56	You were adopted, elena.
		넌 입양된거야, 엘레나
00:37:58	 
		 
00:38:01	There you are.
		여기 있었네
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:03	Hey.
		안녕
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	All right,ook.
		좋아
00:38:06	 
		 
00:38:06	I know I don't know you,
		so don't ask me why I did this.
		난 널 잘 모르는 거 알아
		그러니 왜냐고 묻지마
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	I just, sometimes-- mostly all the time-
		난 그냥 가끔씩
		아니 거의 대부분
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:13	I have this need to be right.
		옳게 바로잡고 싶은
		심리가 있거든
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	So I googled and...
		그래서 검색해봤더니..
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	What is it?

00:38:19	Proof. Sort of.
		증거지. 일종의
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:30	What does this mean?
		그게 무슨 뜻이야?
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:31	Well, I only went as far back as 1942,
		1942년 자료까지 밖에
		못 찾았는데
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:33	And found that there's been
		a string of animal attacks
		연속적인 동물의 습격이
		터졌던 걸 발견했어
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	Periodically in and around this
		town for the past 75 years.
		지난 75년간 이 동네의
		주변에 주기적으로 말이지
00:38:40

00:38:43	In '62, 5 boes found.
		62년 시체 5구 발견

00:38:59	 
		 
00:39:01	How do you know th?
		어떻게 알아낸 거야?
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	Your birth certificate

00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:21	For me to go any further, I would've
		had to look into the pierce family,
		더 알아보려면 피어스가를
		자세히 들여다 봐야 하는데
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:24	And I couldn do that.
		It's too much of a risk.
		그럴 수가 없어
		너무 위험하거든

		너한텐 말야. 나한텐

		you lie to me about it?
		어디 있었니? 왜
		나한테 거짓말 한거야?
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	I thought that we were closer than that.

00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	Now is not the time you want
		to talk to me about lies.
		지금 나한테 거짓말에 대해
		얘기할 때가 아냐
