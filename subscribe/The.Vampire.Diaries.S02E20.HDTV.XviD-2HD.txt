		지난이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	- You must be Elena
		-How do we look exactly alike?
		- 네가 엘레나구나
		- 어떻게 이리 닮은거죠?
00:00:03	 
		 
00:00:03	You're a Petrova doppelganger.
		페트로바의 도플갱어야
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	You're the key to
		breaking the curse.
		저주를 깨는 열쇠지
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	The Sun and the Moon curse?
		태양과 달의 저주요?
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	It's a curse placed on Klaus.
		클라우스한테만
		적용되는 저주야
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	What does that make Klaus--
		그럼 클라우스는
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	- A werewolf or a vampire?
		- He's both.
		- 뱀파이어, 늑대인간?
		- 둘 다야
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	When I was little, your mom used
		to tell me stories about vampires.
		어릴 때 네 엄마가
		뱀파이어에 대한 얘기를 해줬어
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	I never thought that what
		she said could be true.
		난 그게 진짜 존재할거라 생각 못했지
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	What is Klaus' curse?
		클라우스가 걸린 저주가 뭐죠?
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	Witches, serpents of nature,
		자연의 하인인 마녀들은
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	saw to it that my brother's werewolf
		side would become dormant.
		늑대인간의 능력을
		쓰지 못하게 만들었지
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	He wants to trigger that part
		of him that's a werewolf.
		늑대인간의 저주를
		일깨우고 싶은거야
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:27	- Klaus can't be killed?
		- Curse must be broken
		- 클라우스를 죽일순 없나요?
		- 저주는 깨져야만 해
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	when Klaus is in transition.
		클라우스가 변이중일때
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	That's when he'll be
		at his most vulnerable.
		그 때 가장 약해지지
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	Bonnie will be able to kill Klaus
		wihout setting the curse off
		보니는 다치지 않고
		클라우스를 죽일거에요
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	and Elijah knows
		how to save my life.
		일라이자는
		날 살릴 방법을 알구요
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	You can all go to hell.
		다들 지옥에나 떨어져
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:53	Tonight
		is the full moon.
		오늘 보름달이 뜬다
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	We should assume that Klaus is
		prepared to break the curse.
		클라우스가 저주를 깨기 위한
		준비를 하는 게 틀림없어
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	Elena said that the Sun and
		the Moon curse is fake?
		엘레나가 그러길
		해와 달의 저주가 가짜라고요?
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:02	That it's actually just a
		curse placed on Klaus.
		사실 그건 클라우스만
		걸린 저주라고요
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:05	Klaus is a vampire
		borne of a werewolf bloodline.
		클라우스는 늑대인간 혈통도
		물려받은 뱀파이어야
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	The curse has kept his werewolf
		aspect from manifesting.
		저주는 늑대인간의 면을
		쓸 수 없게 만들었지
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:11	But if he breaks it...
		He'll be a true hybrid.
		하지만 그 저주를 깨면
		진실한 변종이 되는거야
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:16	Then why are we letting him
		break the curse?
		그럼 왜 저주를 깨게끔
		가만 두는 거지?
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:20	We can kill him today.
		오늘 죽이면 되잖아
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	With Bonnie.
		Damon...
		보니 가지고
00:01:24	 
		 
00:01:24	No. Bonnie can't use that
		much power without dying.
		아뇨, 보니는 죽을 정도로
		많은 힘을 쓸수 없다구요
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	I'll write her a great eulogy.
		멋진 송덕문을 써줄게
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:29	It's not an option, Damon.
		그건 선택사항이 아녜요
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	All right, how do we
		break this curse?
		어떻게 저주를 깨죠?
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:34	Well, the ritual itself is
		relatively straightforward.
		제물의식 자체는
		비교적 간단해
00:01:36	 
		 
00:01:36	The ingredients, so to speak,
		이를테면 요소들은
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	you already know.
		이미 여러분도 알고 있겠지
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:39	The moon stone.
		월장석
00:01:41	 
		 
00:01:41	A witch will channel
		the power of the full moon
		보름달의 힘을
		끌어 모을 마녀
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:45	to release the spell
		that's bound within the stone.
		월장석 안에 묶여있는
		주문을 풀어야 하지
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:48	After that, Klaus, being
		both werewolf and vampire,
		그 후에 뱀파이어이자
		늑대인간인 클라우스는
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:52	will sacrifice one of each.
		각각 하나씩 제물로 바칠거야
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	And where do I fit into it?
		그럼 난 어디에 속하죠?
00:01:56	 
		 
00:01:56	The final part of the ritual.
		의식의 마지막 과정
00:01:59	 
		 
00:02:00	Klaus must drink the blood
		클라우스는 도플갱어의
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:02	of the doppelganger...
		피를 마셔야 하지
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:04	To the point of your death.
		네가 죽는 시점까지
00:02:07	 
		 
00:02:11	And that's where you come in.
		그 때 당신이
		들어오는군요
00:02:13	 
		 
00:02:13	This is an elixir
		that I acquired
		캐터리나를 위해
		500년 전 쯤 구한
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:17	some 500 years ago
		for katerina.
		불로장생의 약이지
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:19	It possesses
		mystical properties
		사람을 소생시키는
		신비한 특성을 지녔지
00:02:21	 
		사람을 소생시키는
		신비한 특성을 지녔지
00:02:21	of resuscitation.
		사람을 소생시키는
		신비한 특성을 지녔지
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	So I'll be dead?
		And then you won't.
		- 그럼 난 죽는건가요?
		- 그 후에 살아나지
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:26	That's your plan?
		그게 당신 계획이야?
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:29	A magical witch potion
		with no expiration date?
		유효기간 없는
		마법의 마녀 약?
00:02:32	 
		 
00:02:32	You want to come back to life,
		what about John's ring?
		부활하고 싶은거잖아
		존의 반지는 어때?
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:34	Those rings only work
		on humans.
		그건 인간한테만 효과가 있지
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:36	The doppelganger's a
		supernatural occurrence.
		도플갱어는
		초자연적 존재지
00:02:38	 
		 
00:02:39	Odds are, the ring won't work.
		반지는 효과 없을게 확실하네
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:41	I'll take those odds
		over your elixir.
		불로장생약 보다
		차라리 반지를 택할래요
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:43	What if it doesn't work, Elena?
		효과가 없으면 어떻게, 엘레나?
00:02:46	 
		 
00:02:46	Then I guess I'll just be dead.
		그럼 그냥 죽는거죠
00:02:49	 
		 
00:03:01	Do we know if Klaus has
		everything he needs to do this?
		클라우스가 필요한걸
		다 갖췄는지 어찌 알아요?
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	Does he have a werewolf?
		늑대인간을 잡았나요?
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	Klaus has been waiting to break this
		curse for over a thousand years.
		클라우스는 천 년 넘게
		저주를 풀기 위해 기다렸어
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	If he doesn't already
		have a werewolf,
		벌써 늑대인간이 없다면
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:11	my guess is by tonight,
		he will.
		오늘밤 안에는
		확실히 잡겠지
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:14	Tyler, honey.
		타일러
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	It's your mother.
		네 엄마다
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	I don't know where you are,
		어디 있는지 모르겠다만
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:19	but I need you.
		네가 필요하다
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	I've had an accident
		and I'm in the hospital.
		사고가 나서
		병원에 있어
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:25	Please, Tyler,
		제발
00:03:28	 
		 
00:03:28	come home.
		집에 오렴
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	Why did I say that?
		내가 왜 그 말을 했죠?
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:33	Because you had
		a terrible fall.
		계단을 심하게
		헛디뎠거든요

00:03:53	Breakfast
		of champions, huh?
		챔피언의 아침식사야?
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:56	I'm surrounded by idiots.
		I need all the help I can get.
		바보들에 둘러싸여 있으니
		필요한 도움은 다 청해야 해
00:03:58	 
		 
00:03:58	You know, you're not helping.
		알아, 형은 도움 안되지
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	Elijah is an original vampire, Stefan.
		One we tried to kill.
		일라이자는 원조 뱀파이어야
		우리를 죽이려던 놈
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	You're going
		to believe this guy?
		그 놈을 믿을거야?
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	What do you want me
		to do, Damon?
		나보고 뭘 하라고?
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	Elena made her decision.
		엘레나가 결정을 내렸어
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:08	She's choosing to trust Elijah.
		일라이자를 믿기로
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	I'm going to put
		my faith in her.
		난 그녀를 믿을거야
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	Why? She's going
		to end up dead.
		왜? 결국 죽을건데
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:14	Because she put
		her faith in me.
		날 믿고 있거든
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	She chose to trust me
		in spite of what I am.
		내 정체에도 불구하고
		날 믿기로 선택했지
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:17	I'm going to bet on somebody's
		instincts, it's going to be hers.
		난 누군가의 직감을 믿을래
		바로 그녀 말야
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	Well, then, that makes you the
		biggest idiot of them all.
		그럼 넌 바보들 중에
		상바보가 되는군
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	She chose to trust you, too.
		형도 믿기로 했어
00:04:25	 
		 
00:04:26	Then maybe you shouldn't be
		so sure about her instincts.
		그럼 그녀의 직감에 대해
		확신하면 안되겠네
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:38	You'd think he'd understand
		why I'm willing to do this.
		내가 왜 기꺼이 하려는지
		그가 이해할까요
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	Why are you?
		왜 하는거지?
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:44	I'm the key
		to breaking the curse.
		저주를 푸는 열쇠잖아요
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Klaus is here because of me.
		클라우스는 나 때문에
		여기 있구요
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	If I don't stop him, then
		he's going to hurt people.
		내가 멈추지 않으면
		사람들을 해칠거에요
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	It's that simple.
		그렇게 간단하죠
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	You know, there's a possibility
		this elixir won't work.
		불로장생약이 통하지 않을
		가능성도 있어
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	I don't want to mislead you.
		네 판단을 그르게 하고 싶지 않다
00:04:59	 
		 
00:04:59	I know the chance I'm taking.
		제가 어떤 위험을
		감수하는지 알아요
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:08	Jenna, put the cross-bow down, ok?
		It's me.
		제나, 그 활은 치워 응?
		나야
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	- Stay away from me.
		- What's going on?
		- 저리 비켜
		- 무슨 일이죠?
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:13	It's me, Elena, I swear, ok?
		나야, 엘레나
		맹세해
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:15	He let me go.
		Klaus let me go.
		날 풀어줬어
		클라우스가
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	Prove it.
		증명해보게
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	Ok, uh, first night you
		and I spent together,
		당신이랑 같이
		보낸 첫날밤에
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	Jeremy walked in right
		when I was about to--
		제레미가 막 들어와서
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	it's him.
		맞아요
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:26	Why did he let you go?
		왜 풀어준거지?
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	He wanted me
		to deliver a message.
		메세지를 전달하라고 부탁했어
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:32	The sacrifice happens tonight.
		제물의식이 오늘 행해진대
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:50	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Mom.
		엄마
00:05:55	 
		 
00:06:04	You're back.
		돌아왔구나
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	I'm back.
		네
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	Ohh.
		 
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:14	Jeez!
		이런!
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	Sorry!
		미안
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	I didn't mean to scare you.
		겁줄 의도는 없었어
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	It's ok, I just, I didn't
		know you were here.
		괜찮아, 네가
		있는지 몰랐어
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	Yeah, I wanted to try and catch you
		on your break so we could hang out.
		휴식시간에 좀 보고 싶었어
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	- I have lunch in an hour.
		- Perfect.
		- 1시간 후에 점심시간이야
		- 좋았어
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:26	I will go run some errands
		and I will be right back.
		볼일 좀 보고
		곧 돌아올게
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:30	- I'll see you in a bit.
		- Ok.
		좀 있다 보자
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:42	- Does she suspect anything?
		- No, but...
		- 낌새를 챘나?
		- 아뇨
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:45	I can't do this anymore.
		더이상 못하겠어요
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:47	I've been with her
		the past few days,
		지난 며칠간 같이 있으면서
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	and I'm putting on the
		best show of my life.
		제 인생 최고의
		연기를 하고 있는데
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	But either she is too, or she's
		still the same Caroline.
		그녀도 똑같아요
		같은 캐롤라인이라구요
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	She's not the same.
		She's a vampire.
		캐롤라인은 달라
		뱀파이어가 됐지
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	At this point, I don't
		even know what that means.
		이 순간 전 그게
		무슨 뜻인지 몰라요
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	Look, I know this is hard
		to understand,
		이해하기 힘든거 안다
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	but my family,
		we were raised with this.
		하지만 내 가족은
		이 얘기를 듣고 자라왔어
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	They're monsters, Matt.
		그들은 괴물이야, 맷
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	They have no soul, no humanity.
		영혼도 인간성도 없지
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	There's nothing about her
		that makes me believe that.
		그걸 믿기엔
		그녀는 전혀 다른걸요
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	It's an act.
		가식일 뿐야
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	I believed Damon Salvatore
		was my closest ally
		데이먼 살바토어가
		내 가까운 동료라 생각했지만
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	in this town.
		Instead, he's a killer.
		사실상 살인마였지
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:17	They killed your sister.
		네 동생을 죽였어
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:21	What other proof do you need?
		다른 증거가 뭐 필요하니?
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	I could ask you the
		same question, sheriff.
		저도 보안관님께
		같은 질문을 하고 싶어요
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	Why haven't you done anything?
		Why are you hesitating?
		왜 아무것도 안하시죠?
		왜 머뭇거리시냐구요?
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	Because I need more
		information.
		더 많은 정보가 필요하니까
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	And because, in spite
		of everything I just said,
		왜냐면, 내가 말한 것들에도 불구하고
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	I still look at her and I--
		캐롤라인을 보면..
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	I see my daughter.
		내 딸이 보이거든
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:40	Damon is the problem,
		not Caroline.
		데이먼이 문제지
		캐롤라인이 아냐
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	You should focus on him.
		그를 집중적으로 관찰해라
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	I shouldn't
		have involved you, Matt.
		널 말려들게 하는게 아녔는데
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	Thank you for all of your help,
		여태껏 도움 고맙다
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	but I'll take it from here.
		하지만 이제부터 내가 하마
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:54	So you don't remember
		anything that happened?
		아무것도 기억 안나요?
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	No. It's like I blacked out
		and woke up 3 days later.
		기절하고 3일 후에 깨어났어
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:03	Katherine was there.
		She's under compulsion.
		캐더린이 있더라
		주문에 걸렸어
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	Damon snuck her some vervain,
		데이먼이 마편초를 좀 줬어
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	but she can't leave until
		Klaus tells her she can.
		클라우스가 하라고 할 때까진
		나갈 수 없지만
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	- Where is Damon?
		- I saw him go upstairs.
		- 데이먼은?
		- 윗층 올라가는거 봤어
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:16	So what else did I do?
		내가 또 뭘 했길래?
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:24	You disappeared.
		말없이 사라지셨네요
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	I don't want to hear anymore.
		더 듣고 싶지 않았어
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	I need you to understand
		why I'm doing this.
		제가 왜 이걸 하는지
		이해해주세요
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	Why? It clearly
		doesn't matter what I think.
		왜? 명백히
		내 생각은 중요치 않잖아
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	I'll be fine, Damon.
		난 괜찮을거에요
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:35	I'll drink the elixir,
		Bonnie will kill Klaus,
		난 불로장생약을 먹고
		보니는 클라우스를 죽이고
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	and then all of this
		will finally be over.
		그리고 마침내
		다 끝나는 거에요
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	- If it works.
		- It will work.
		- 잘 풀린다면
		- 잘 될거에요
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	You think it will work.
		You want it to work.
		잘될거라 생각하는거지
		그러길 바라는거고
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	Why am I the only one
		who's convinced it won't?
		효과 없을거라 확신하는건
		왜 나 밖에 없는거지?
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	- There has to be another way.
		- There isn't.
		- 다른 방법이 존재할거야
		- 없어요
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	And you're going to die, Elena.
		그럼 넌 죽게 될거야
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:55	And then I'll come
		back to life.
		그리고 다시 살아돌아오죠
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	That is not a risk
		I'm willing to take.
		난 그런 위험은
		무릅쓰고 싶지 않아
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	But I am.
		난 무릅쓸거에요
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:04	It's my life, Damon.
		내 인생이에요, 데이먼
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:08	My choice.
		내 선택
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:13	I can't lose you.
		널 잃을 수 없어
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:18	You won't.
		그럴 일 없어요
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:35	There is another way.
		다른 방법이 있어
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	What are you...
		뭘 하려는..
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	Damon, no!
		데이먼, 안돼요!
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	Damon, no!
		안돼!
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:47	No! No!
		안돼!
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:51	What did you do?!
		뭘 한거죠?
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:53	Huh? What did you do?!
		무슨 짓을 한거야?
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	I saved her life.
		그녀를 구한거야
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	You're so bent on dying, at least
		this way I know you'll come back.
		죽는데 기울어져 있어서
		최소한 이방법으로 부활시켜야지
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	As a vampire!
		뱀파이어로 말야!
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	She'll come back a vampire.
		뱀파이어로 돌아오겠지
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	It's better than nothing else.
		죽는것보단 낫잖아
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	How could you, of all people,
		take that choice away from her?
		다른 사람중에서 어떻게 형이
		그 선택권을 뺏어가?
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:10	Go ahead, wish me
		an eternity of misery.
		계속해 영원한 고통을 빌어봐
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	Believe me, you'll get over it.
		믿어봐, 고마워하게 될테니까
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:17	Stefan!
		스테판
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:20	Admit it.
		인정해
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	You just wish you had
		the balls to do it yourself.
		네가 직접할 용기가 있었길 하고
		후회하지
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:35	Damon, no!
		데이먼, 안돼!
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:41	Get out of here!
		여기서 나가
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	What the hell's going on?
		대체 무슨 일이야?
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	Just get him out of here!
		여기서 나가게 하라구요!
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	Oh, my God.
		세상에
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:54	Ok, Jenna, downstairs
		are some blood bags.
		제나, 아래층에
		혈액팩이 있어
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	Go get them now. Go!
		가서 가져와, 알았지?
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:06	It's ok. It's ok.
		You're going to be ok.
		괜찮아
		괜찮아 질거야
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	I'm so sorry.
		정말 미안해
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	Shh. It's ok.
		괜찮아
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:17	Well, it sounds like you won't
		be needing this anymore.
		이게 필요 없어지겠군
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	Feeding her vampire blood
		rendered it useless.
		뱀파이어 피를 먹여서
		쓸모없게 만들어버렸지
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:25	Tell Elena I'll be back
		before nightfall.
		엘레나한테 해질녘 전에
		돌아오겠다 말하게
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	We'll proceed as planned.
		계획대로 진행할거야
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	We both know that elixir
		wouldn't have worked anyway.
		어차피 불로장생약이
		통하지 않을걸 알고 있었잖나
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:32	The problem, Damon,
		문제는 말이지, 데이먼
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	you talk a good game but you
		don't actually know anything.
		아는척 말하지만
		사실 아무것도 몰라
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:40	She'll never forgive you.
		엘레나는 자넬 절대 용서 못할거야
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:44	And never for a vampire...
		뱀파이어로도 말이지
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	It's a very long time.
		아주 오랜 세월이거든
00:11:50	 
		 
00:12:03	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	Both of you.
		둘 다 말이죠
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	Yeah, well,
		we'll be downstairs.
		아래층에 가있을게
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:12	I know it's, uh,
		it's a lot to take in.
		받아들이기 힘든거 알아
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	Yeah.
		응
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:18	I tried to protect
		you from all this,
		이런 일들로 부터
		당신을 지키고 싶었지만
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	but I should have known
		you could handle it.
		감당할 준비가 된걸
		알았어야 했어
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:24	Can I?
		감당할 수 있을까?
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	Well, you just did.
		방금 잘 받아들였잖아
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	Look, Jenna...
		제나
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	I know we have
		a lot to talk about.
		얘기할게 정말 많아
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	Hey.
		알라릭
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:35	I'm glad you're ok.
		무사해서 다행이야
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:39	I should have
		said that already.
		미리 말할걸 그랬어
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:50	How could he do that
		to me? Why?
		어떻게 나한테 그럴 수 있지? 왜?
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	Hey.
		엘레나
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:59	We've never talked about this.
		이 얘기 안 해봤지
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	What this all means.
		이게 어떤 의미인지
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	It doesn't matter.
		중요치 않아
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	Of course it matters. Hey.
		물론 중요하지
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	It matters.
		중요해
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	I want you to go
		somewhere with me.
		나랑 같이 어디 가자
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	Stefan, I can't.
		스테판, 안돼
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	No, no, it's not far, ok?
		그리 멀지 않아
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	It's just for the day.
		오늘 하루만
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	I promise.
		맹세해
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:39	What are you doing here?
		여긴 왜 온거죠?
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	I should be asking you that.
		나야말로 묻고 싶다
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	I told you not to come.
		오지 말랬잖아요
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	She's my mother.
		I had to.
		우리 엄마에요
		왔어야 했다구요
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Now we have to get out of here;
		이제 여기서 나가자
00:13:49	 
		 
00:13:49	Lock ourselves up
		before tonight.
		오늘밤 되기 전에
		묶어두고 있어야지
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:58	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	Jules.
		줄스
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:05	I'll give you a few minutes.
		잠깐 시간 주마
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	Just a few, Tyler.
		몇 분만이다
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	I got it.
		알았어요
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:17	She's just
		making sure I'm safe.
		내가 안전한가 확인하러 온거야
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:20	So what, are you two,
		like, friends now?
		그럼 너희 둘
		이제 친구가 된거야?
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	She's been helping me.
		날 도와줬어
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:27	How are you?
		어때?
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:29	I heard about your mom.
		네 엄마 얘기 들었어
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:31	I just came to check in on her.
		확인하러 들렀어
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	She's banged up,
		but she'll be ok.
		어디 부딪히셨는데
		괜찮아지실거야
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:38	And you? Um...
		넌?
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	How's everything with you?
		넌 좀 어때?
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	I'm hanging in there.
		그럭저럭 버티고 있지
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:46	Good.
		좋아
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:48	Yeah.
		그래
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:53	I should get going.
		가봐야겠다
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	Jules and I need
		to get on the road.
		줄스랑 난 떠나야 해
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	You're leaving again?
		또 떠나게?
00:14:58	 
		 
00:15:00	I left for a reason, Caroline.
		이유가 있어서 떠났어
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	Your explanation must have
		got lost in the mail,
		네 설명 메일은
		중간에 사라졌나봐
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	along with your good-bye.
		네 작별인사도 말이지
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:08	Well...
		그게...
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:15	Take care of yourself.
		몸 조심 잘해
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:20	Tyler--
		타일러
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:37	Let's go.
		어서 가자
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:41	Hey, Caroline, it's me.
		캐롤라인, 나야
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	I thought you were
		coming back to meet me.
		나 만나러 오는줄 알았는데
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Look, I need to talk to you.
		It's important.
		얘기할게 있어
		중요한 거야
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:54	Thanks.
		고마워요
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:57	I'll have the same.
		나도 같은걸로 줘요
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:02	I screwed up.
		내가 망쳤어
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	Yeah.
		그래
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	Yeah, you did.
		그랬고 말고
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	Gentlemen?
		신사분들?
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	Why so glum?
		왜 이리 우울한가?
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:17	Ugh.
		이런
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	Klaus, I presume.
		클라우스겠죠
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	In the flesh.
		클라우스 본인의 몸으로 말이지
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	Thanks for the loaner, mate.
		몸 빌려줘서 고마웠네
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:26	Any reason you stopped
		by to say hi?
		안부 전하러 들른 이유라도?
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	I'm told you and your brother
		fancy my doppelganger.
		네 형제가 내 도플갱어를
		연모한다고 들었네
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	Just thought I'd remind you to
		not do anything you'll regret.
		후회할 일은 하지 말라고
		상기시켜주러 온거야
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	Ha.
		 
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:39	Thanks for your advice.
		충고 고마워요
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:43	I don't suppose
		I could talk you
		짐작컨데
		내가 설마
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	into a postponement,
		by any chance, huh?
		미루게끔 설득은 못하겠죠?
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	You are kidding.
		농담이지
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	He is kidding, right?
		농담 맞지?
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:54	No, not really.
		아뇨
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	I mean, come on,
		what's one month
		그러니까
		장대한 계획에서
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	in the whole grand
		scheme of things?
		한달 정도가 뭐 대수라고?
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	Let me be clear--
		확실히 하지
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	I have my vampire.
		난 뱀파이어를 데리고 있어
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	I have my werewolves.
		늑대인간도
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	I have everything I need.
		필요한 건 다 갖췄지
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	The ritual will happen tonight.
		제물의식은 오늘 행해질거네
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	So if you want to
		live to see tomorrow,
		그러니까 내일
		직접 보고 싶다면
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	don't screw it up.
		망치지 말게
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:24	That was fun.
		재미있네
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	You're getting
		screwed up, aren't you?
		계획이 망했군?
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:28	You think if I took his
		werewolf out of the equation,
		늑대인간을
		공식에서 뺄 수 있다면
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:30	she might...
		Get over the fact
		그녀는 내가
		뱀파이어로 만들려 했던걸
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	that I tried to turn
		her into a vampire?
		봐줄수 있겠지?
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	I think it won't matter,
		because you'll be dead.
		상관 없어
		네가 죽게 될테니
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	But without the werewolf,
		하지만 늑대인간 없이는
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	he can't perform
		the ritual tonight,
		오늘밤 제물의식을 행할 수 없어
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	which means I would have
		bought her one month
		그뜻은 한 달 까지
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	before the next full moon.
		시간을 벌 수 있단거지
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	But you'll still be dead.
		그래도 자넨 죽을거야
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	Are you gonna help me or what?
		날 도울건가 말건가?
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:49	What do you want me to do?
		뭘 하길 바라는데?
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:57	Where are we?
		여기가 어디야?
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	It's a surprise.
		깜짝선물
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	Just a little bit longer.
		좀 길어
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	I'm not a vampire yet,
		you know.
		난 아직 뱀파이어 아냐
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	My legs still get tired.
		다리가 아직 아프다고
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	Ready to talk about how you're
		feeling about all this?
		기분이 어떤지 말할 준비됐어?
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	Uh... this morning
		I was wondering
		오늘 아침에
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	if I would live or die,
		and now...
		내가 죽을지 살지
		생각했는데 이젠
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	I'm going to be
		a vampire. I--
		뱀파이어가 될거야
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	I don't really
		know how I'm feeling.
		그 기분이 어떤지 모르겠어
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:27	My God, this is beautiful.
		와, 정말 예쁘다
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:34	I think you do know
		how you feel.
		기분을 알겠구나
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	I just want you to know
		that it's ok to tell me.
		네 심정을 말해도 괜찮단걸
		알려주고 싶었어
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	I can't.
		안 되겠어
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	Stefan, I just...
		스테판, 난
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	I can't talk about it.
		말할 수 없어
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	Well, if you don't want to,
		that's your choice.
		말하고 싶지 않으면
		네 선택이야
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	Today's about you.
		오늘은 널 위한 날이니까
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	But...
		하지만
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	It's a long way to the top.
		정상까진 멀어
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	Let's go. You never know
		what might come up.
		어서 가자, 뭐가 나타날지 모르니
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:04	We're climbing
		all the way up to the top?
		정상까지 올라간다고?
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	Oh, yeah.
		그래
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	Well, can't you do
		one of your super power
		네 초능력중에
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	vampire jumpy things?
		뱀파이어 점프 뭐시기 못하나?
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:13	No, it's your last
		day as a human.
		안돼, 오늘은
		인간으로 마지막날인데
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Why cheat now?
		왜 속임수를 쓰게?
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:39	Look who's dumb enough
		to come back.
		누군가 바보같이 돌아오셨네
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	Well, somebody had
		to invite him in.
		누군가 초대를 해줘야 했으니까
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:46	Damon.
		데이먼
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	Would you like to, uh,
		혹시
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	come in?
		들어올래?
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:56	Are you trying
		to get me killed?
		날 죽게 만들 작정이야?
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	I gave you vervain,
		마편초를 줬으니
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	now I'm here to collect.
		돌려받으러 왔어
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	I got it from here, Rick.
		여기선 내가 처리할게
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	- You sure?
		- Yeah, only one of us
		- 확실해?
		- 우리 중에 한명만
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	needs to get blamed for this.
		Get back in the house.
		비난받으면 되니까
		집에 돌아가
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:09	Keep Elena from
		handing herself over.
		엘레나가 목숨바치지
		못하게 지켜봐
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	- Ok.
		- Get blamed for what?
		- 알았어
		- 무슨 비난?
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	I need to know where Klaus
		is keeping his werewolf.
		클라우스가 늑대인간을
		가둬둔 장소를 알려줘
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	Why? What are you going to do?
		왜? 머 하려고?
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:19	- Dead werewolf equals no ritual.
		- No.
		늑대인간이 죽으면
		의식도 없어져 / 안돼
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	You can't interfere, Damon.
		넌 간섭할 수 없어, 데이먼
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	Klaus will kill you
		and everyone you've ever met.
		클라우스가 너와 네가 만난
		모든 이를 죽일거야
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:25	I just need
		to delay this thing.
		이 의식을 미뤄야 해
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	No. No way.
		절대 안돼
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	You should like this.
		It's going to buy another month
		좋아해야 해
		네 딱한 삶에 한 달을 번다니
00:20:29	 
		좋아해야 해
		네 딱한 삶에 한 달을 번다니
00:20:29	of your pathetic life.
		좋아해야 해
		네 딱한 삶에 한 달을 번다니
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	Right. Except that
		I'm not the vampire
		맞다. 하지만 난
		그가 희생을 계획한
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	he's planning on sacrificing.
		뱀파이어가 아니란거 몰랐어?
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	- What?
		- Yeah.
		- 뭐라고?
		- 그래
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	He's got Caroline Forbes
		and Tyler Lockwood.
		캐롤라인 포브스와
		타일러 락우드를 잡아뒀지
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	Therefore, I'm in the clear.
		그러니, 난 무사해
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	- And where'd he get that idea from?
		- Hey!
		- 어디서 알았어?
		- 이봐
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	Hey, hey, hey, I'm just
		trying to stay alive
		난 오랫동안
		몸 간수 잘 했다가
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	long enough to get
		myself out of here.
		여기서 나갈거야
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:51	What if I told you Elena
		had vampire blood in her system?
		엘레나 체내에
		뱀파이어 피가 있다면?
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	What?!
		뭐라고?
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	Imagine how much fun that will be
		competing with Elena for Stefan's love
		스테판의 사랑을 두고
		엘레나와 경쟁하면 참 재미있겠다
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	for, I don't know, forever.
		영원히 말이지
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:06	The tomb.
		무덤
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	He's got them in the tomb.
		무덤속에 가둬뒀어
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:10	Thank you.
		고마워
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:25	- Tyler?
		- You all right?
		- 타일러?
		- 괜찮아?
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	Yeah.
		응
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	I think so.
		그런 거 같아
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:33	I already tried.
		나도 시도해봤어
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:41	Those witches vervained me.
		마녀들이 마편초를 먹였어
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	Who were they?
		누구야?
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	I think they're with Klaus.
		클라우스 부하들 같아
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	Who the hell is Klaus?
		대체 클라우스가 누구야?
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:50	Tyler...
		타일러
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:54	You shouldn't have
		come back here.
		여기 와선 안됐는데
00:21:58	 
		 
00:22:04	I guess Bonnie will have to
		make me a daylight ring.
		보니가 태양 반지를
		만들어줘야 겠네
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	Yeah, piece of cake.
		그래, 누워서 떡먹기지
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	And I'll never be able
		to watch "Bambi" again.
		난 '밤비'를 더이상 못 볼테고
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:11	I definitely
		wouldn't recommend that.
		그래 별로 추천하고 싶지 않지
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:14	What's the best part
		about being a vampire?
		뱀파이어가 되서
		제일 좋은 점이 뭐야?
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:17	Ahh.
		 
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	You feel like
		you could do anything.
		뭐든지 할 수 있을거란 느낌
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	Be anyone.
		누구든지
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:25	Beautiful things
		are more beautiful.
		아름다운 건 더 아름답고
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:28	Everything's heightened, you know,
		just a little bit more intensely,
		모든게 극대화되지
		좀 더 강하게
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:31	love more powerfully.
		더 힘있게 사랑하게 되지
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:33	And the worst?
		가장 안 좋은 점은?
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:35	Ah, you know the worst.
		너도 알잖아
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	Aside from the blood.
		피를 빼고
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:41	Anger becomes rage.
		노염은 격노가 되어
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:45	When you're sad,
		you're in despair.
		슬플때는
		절망에 빠지지
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:50	Grief.
		비탄함
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:51	Loss.
		상실감
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	It can cripple you.
		널 옭아맬 수도 있어
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:57	That's why so many of us
		turn our emotions off.
		그래서 우리들은 대부분
		감정을 끄고 살려 하지
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:00	It just becomes...
		감정이..
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	Too overwhelming.
		너무 압박이 되니까
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:08	You know, for a while, for me,
		한동안 난
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:12	the good just wasn't
		worth the bad.
		장점이 단점만큼 느껴지지 않았었지
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	How long before you
		learned to handle both?
		둘 다 다루는 법을 배우기까지
		얼마나 오래 걸렸어?
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	Well, I'm still trying.
		Every day.
		노력중이지 매일
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:26	What else?
		또 물어보고 싶은거 있어?
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	Let's just keep going.
		그냥 가자
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	We're not even
		halfway to the top.
		아직 절반도 못 왔잖아
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:49	Everything ok?
		아무일 없었나요?
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:53	What have you been doing?
		뭐하고 있었지?
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:55	Making coffee.
		Do you want some?
		커피 만들고 있었죠
		드실래요?
00:23:58	 
		 
00:23:59	Tell me what you've been doing.
		뭐 하고 있었는지 말해봐
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	Making coffee.
		커피 만들고 있었어요
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:15	Wait.
		잠깐
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:22	Take off your bracelet.
		팔찌 빼
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:30	Now.
		당장
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:30	I want you...
		이젠
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:33	to walk over to the window
		창문으로 다가가
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	and stand in the sunlight.
		햇빛 아래 서 있어라
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:38	But I'll burn.
		살이 탈텐데
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:39	You don't have a choice.
		넌 선택권이 없어
00:24:41	 
		 
00:25:01	That's enough.
		그 정도면 됐어
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:05	Hmmm.
		 
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:07	Guess I was wrong.
		내가 틀렸나보군
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	All right, then.
		좋았어
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:13	I need you to do
		something for me.
		날 위해 부탁 좀 들어주게
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:24	Which one are you
		trying to save?
		누굴 구하려는 거지?
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	The blond, or the wolf?
		금발 아님 늑대?
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:32	Did you really think Klaus
		would leave them unprotected?
		클라우스가 무방비로 뒀을줄 알았나?
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	Wishful thinking.
		희망에 찬 생각이지
00:25:38	 
		 
00:26:12	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐해?
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	Where's Caroline?
		캐롤라인은?
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:15	Listen, man.
		Not a good time to play the hero.
		들어봐. 영웅놀이 할 시간 아냐
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	Where is she?
		어디있어?
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	And what did he do to her?
		무슨 짓을 한거야?
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	I'm just here with you, ok?
		구하러 온거야
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:28	You're lucky I already
		screwed up once today.
		오늘 한번 망친게
		행운인줄 알아
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	You'd be dead.
		안 그랬음 넌 죽었을테니까
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:43	The whole Sun
		and Moon curse is fake?
		해와 달의 저주가 가짜라고?
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:46	That's
		what Elena learned.
		엘레나가 알게 됐어
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	Klaus still needs
		to do the sacrifice,
		클라우스는 제물의식을 해야 해
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	but it's just not for that.
		하지만 그걸 위해서가 아냐
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:53	And you think that's
		why they grabbed us?
		그래서 우릴 잡은거라 생각해?
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	For the sacrifice.
		Yes.
		제물 의식 때문에 / 그래
00:26:57	 
		 
00:26:57	He's going to kill us?
		우릴 죽이려고?
00:26:59	 
		 
00:26:59	I think so.
		그런 거 같아
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:01	Yes.
		그래
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:06	This whole time I've been gone,
		내가 사라진 동안
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	Jules has been helping me
		come to terms with what I am.
		줄스는 내 존재에 대해
		길들여지도록 도와줬어
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	How to deal with it.
		어떻게 감당하는지
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:17	Guess none of it
		matters anymore.
		더이상 중요치 않겠네
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:21	Why didn't you say good-bye?
		왜 작별인사도 안 했어?
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:27	You just left.
		그냥 떠났잖아
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	You want to talk
		about this now?
		지금 그걸 말하고 싶어?
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:32	Well, if we're going to die,
		I might as well know the truth.
		죽을거라면
		사실을 아는게 낫지
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:39	Why did you leave me?
		왜 날 떠났니?
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:45	I knew you hated me.
		날 미워한 줄 알았어
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:49	I thought you deserved better
		난 네가 나보다
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:52	than having someone
		like me in your life.
		더 좋은 사람을 만날
		자격이 있다 싶었어
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:56	I was hurt. You know, you turned
		your back on me when I needed you.
		난 상처입었어. 내가 필요로 할때
		넌 등을 돌렸다구
00:28:01	 
		 
00:28:02	But...
		하지만..
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	I could never hate you, Tyler.
		난 절대 널 미워할 수 없어
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:16	Damon?
		데이먼?
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:17	Your boyfriend's outside with a
		rifle loaded with wooden bullets.
		네 남친이 바깥에서
		나무총알 장전된 총을 들고있다
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:20	You have some explaining to do.
		나한테 설명 좀 해야겠구나
00:28:21	 
		 
00:28:21	- What, Matt?
		- Matt knows about you?
		- 맷이요?
		- 맷이 네 정체를 알아?
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:24	No, I--
		아뇨, 난..
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:25	Shh. Tomorrow's problem.
		내일이 문제야
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	Let me just
		get you out of here.
		여기서 우선 나가게 하자
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:30	Wait, Damon No!
		잠깐, 데이먼 안돼요!
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	I'm not leaving without him.
		타일러 없이
		가지 않을래요
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	Ohhh.
		 
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	It's getting dark soon.
		곧 어두워지는데
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:38	How fast can you get
		the hell away from here?
		얼마나 빨리
		갈 수 있겠어?
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	I need to get to my
		family's cellar.
		우리 가문 지하실로
		가야겠어요
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	- I can lock myself up.
		- I'll help.
		- 날 가둬둘거에요
		- 도와주마
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:50	Don't make me regret this.
		후회하지 않게 해
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:55	We made it! Ahh.
		드디어 왔네!
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	That's nothing, if you've
		climbed Mt. Everest.
		아무것도 아냐
		에버레스트 올라봐
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	Nobody likes a bragger, Stefan.
		자랑꾼 좋아하는 사람 없다구, 스테판
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:05	Oh, wow.
		와
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:07	Yeah.
		그래
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:16	Hey, you can say it.
		말해도 돼
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:18	Say what?
		뭘?
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:20	The thing you've been
		wanting to say, but...
		네가 하고 싶었던 말들
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	Been afraid of how
		it'll make me feel.
		나한테 말하기 두려웠던거
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	There's nothing I can say, Stefan.
		It's not going to change anything.
		말할 거 없어, 스테판
		달라질 거 없다구
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:29	Might make you feel better.
		더 기분이 나아질 수 있어
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:35	Look, I know this isn't the first
		time you've thought about it.
		이 생각은 한번이라도 해봤을거 아냐
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	Drinking vampire blood
		to survive.
		생존을 위해
		뱀파이어 피를 마시는거
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:42	I mean, I know I've thought
		about it a hundred times.
		난 몇백번도 생각했는걸
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:44	And before all this with Klaus,
		did you think about it then?
		클라우스와 이러기 전에도
		그 선택권을 생각해봤어?
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	Of course I did.
		물론이지
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:50	Elena...
		엘레나
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	If it were my choice,
		내가 선택할 수 있다면
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	I'd want to be
		with you forever.
		너랑 영원히 함께하길 바랐을 거야
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:59	Why have you never
		brought it up?
		왜 그 생각에 대한 얘기는
		꺼내지 않은거야?
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	'Cause I knew if it was an
		option, you would have.
		그게 선택 사항이었다면
		너도 미리 알았을테니까
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	It would be selfish
		for me to ask you.
		네게 물어보기엔
		이기적일 거 같았어
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	Didn't stop Damon.
		데이먼은 결국 못 말렸네
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	He shouldn't have
		done what he did.
		그런 짓을 해선 안됐어
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:14	He did it because he loves you.
		널 사랑해서 한거야
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:18	But he did this to me,
		Stefan, which means
		하지만 나한테 했다고
		스테판, 그 뜻은
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	he doesn't really know
		what love is.
		진짜 사랑이 뭔지
		모른단 거야
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	And to be honest,
		I don't know if I do.
		사실 나도 잘 몰라
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	I'm 17 years old.
		난 17살인걸
00:30:28	 
		 
00:30:29	How am I supposed to know
		any of this yet?
		이런걸 어찌 다 알겠어?
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:33	I know that I love you, Stefan.
		내가 널 사랑한단 거 알아
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:36	I know that.
		그건 알아
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	But my future?
		Our lives together?
		하지만 내 미래는?
		우리가 함께할 삶은?
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	Those were things
		I was supposed to deal with
		그건 때가 되면 천천히
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:44	as they came along.
		대면하며 배워야 하는 거였다고
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	I was supposed to grow up.
		난 철이 들어야 했어
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	Decide if I want to have kids
		내가 아이를 원하는지
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	and start a family.
		Grow old.
		가정을 원하는지 결정하고
		늙어가는 거
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	I was supposed to have
		a lifetime of those choices,
		난 그런 선택들을 하는
		인생을 살아야 한다고
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	and... now?
		하지만 이젠?
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	That's all gone.
		다 사라졌어
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:07	Elena, say it.
		엘레나, 말해
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	Please.
		제발
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:11	I don't want to be
		a vampire, Stefan.
		뱀파이어가 되고 싶지 않아, 스테판
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:15	I never wanted to be one.
		난 절대 원한적 없었어
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	I know.
		알아
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:22	Ok.
		좋아
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:34	Hey, Matt!
		맷!
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	Hey. Did you
		hit him?!
		오빠가 때린거야?
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	Did you already forget the part about
		the gun with the wooden bullets?
		나무총알이 든 총으로
		장전한거 벌써 잊었어?
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:42	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:47	- It's starting.
		- Ugh.
		시작됐어
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	Grab boy wonder and let's go.
		궁금증 많은 소년 끌고 나가라
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	Come on.
		어서
00:31:54	 
		 
00:32:20	Thanks for today.
		오늘 고마웠어
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:27	You got me all nervous.
		자네 덕에 긴장했네
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	I thought maybe
		you'd done something stupid.
		바보같은 짓을 할 줄 알았지
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:35	You ready, my dear?
		준비됐나?
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:40	I'm ready.
		준비 됐어요
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:43	No.
		아니
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:45	I wouldn't.
		나라면 그러지 않을텐데
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:48	No reason for you to die, too.
		죽을 이유 없잖아
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	No.
		아니
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	Stefan, hey, hey,
		it's fine, it's fine.
		스테판
		괜찮아
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:54	I'll go.
		갈게
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	No one needs to get hurt.
		아무도 다쳐선 안돼
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:59	There's no reason
		for you to get hurt.
		네가 다칠 이유 없다고
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:07	Hey.
		 
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:16	I love you.
		사랑해
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:27	I love you.
		나도 사랑해
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:42	Close your eyes.
		눈 감아
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:50	Close your eyes.
		눈 감아
00:33:53	 
		 
00:34:21	There you are. I got here,
		the house was empty.
		여기 있네, 도착하니
		집이 비어 있더군
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:25	Where's Damon?
		데이먼은?
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:26	What's happening?
		Is he ok?
		무슨 일이죠?
		괜찮아요?
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:27	He better not wolf out on us.
		늑대로 우릴 잡지 않길 바라자고
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:29	Bad time, little bro.
		지금 걸면 안돼
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:31	What the hell are you doing?
		대체 뭐하고 있어?
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	Saving the day.
		I figured you'd understand.
		목숨을 살리고 있지
		이해할 줄 알았는데
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	Just tell Elena to stay put.
		엘레나한테 얌전히 있으라고 해
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	- She's already gone, Damon.
		- What?
		- 벌써 떠났어
		- 뭐라고?
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	Klaus came.
		클라우스가 왔어
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	He took her.
		데리고 갔어
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:44	I'll take care of it.
		내가 처리할게
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:51	Tyler!
		타일러!
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:55	Oh, God!
		세상에!
00:34:58	 
		 
00:35:02	I don't know if I can hold it off.
		Get out of here.
		버틸 수 있을지 모르겠어
		어서 도망쳐
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:05	- Tyler, it'll be ok.
		- Go!
		- 타일러, 괜찮아
		- 어서 가라구!
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:07	You've got time.
		We're almost there, just--
		시간 남았어
		거의 다 왔어
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	it's happening
		faster.
		더 빨리 변이하고 있어
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:13	Tyler, it's ok.
		타일러, 괜찮아
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:25	- Damon...
		- I'm fine.
		- 데이먼...
		- 난 괜찮아
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	Get out of here!
		여기서 나가!
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:29	Get to the Lockwood cellar.
		락우스 지하실로 가
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	If it held him in,
		it'll keep him out.
		거기 가둬둘 수 있다면
		못들어가게도 할 수 있을거야
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	If it doesn't...
		Use these.
		아니면 이걸 써
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:36	It'll buy you a couple seconds.
		시간 벌어줄게
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:39	Go. Go!
		어서!
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:51	Where's Maddox?
		매덕스는 어디있나?
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:53	He should be back by now.
		곧 돌아올때가 됐는데
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	I don't know.
		모르겠어요
00:35:57	 
		 
00:36:00	What are you doing?
		뭐 해요?
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:04	Where's Elena?
		엘레나는?
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:05	I sent her off with Greta.
		그레타한테 데려갔어요
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:09	It's almost time.
		이제 때가 됐어
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:16	I wasn't aware
		you'd been invited in.
		초대받았는지 몰랐는데
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:21	I've come here to tell you that
		you have to postpone the ritual.
		의식을 미뤄야 한다고
		말해주러 왔어요
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	Didn't we already
		have this conversation?
		이미 했던 얘기 아닌가?
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:26	Yeah, but that was before
		I rescued your werewolf
		네, 하지만 당신 늑대인간과
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	and vampire
		and killed your witch.
		뱀파이어를 구하고
		마녀를 죽이기 전 일이죠
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	Excuse me?
		뭐라고?
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	And you can kill me for it.
		I don't care.
		날 죽여도
		상관 없어요
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	It was all me.
		다 내 탓이니까
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:43	Katerina, give us a moment.
		캐터리나, 잠깐 비켜주게
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:58	I've heard about you.
		자네에 대해 익히 들었지
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	The crazy, impulsive vampire.
		정신나간 충동적 뱀파이어
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	In love with
		his brother's girl.
		동생의 여자와
		사랑에 빠졌다고
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:12	I knew one of you
		would try to stop me.
		둘 중 하나가
		날 막을 줄 알았어
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	It was a just
		a 50/50 guess on who.
		주인공 찾는 확률은
		50대 50이니까
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:26	The nice thing about werewolves
		is they tend to travel in packs.
		늑대인간의 좋은 점은
		무리지어 다닌단 거지
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:34	Need a closer look?
		자세히 볼래?
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:43	Jules.
		줄스군요
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	When you spend a thousand years
		천년 넘게
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	trying to break a curse...
		저주를 깨려 하면
00:37:53	 
		 
00:37:54	You learn a thing or two.
		몇가지 배우게 되지
00:37:58	 
		 
00:38:00	First rule--
		첫째
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	always have
		a back-up.
		2차 계획을 갖고 있어라
00:38:06	 
		 
00:38:06	Back-up werewolf.
		늑대인간을 예비로 하나 더
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	Back-up witch.
		마녀를 예비로 하나 더
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	Back-up vampire.
		뱀파이어를 예비로 하나 더
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	I've got that covered, too.
		그것도 해결됐네
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:20	Come on, down here.
		이리로 와
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:31	- Is that going to hold?
		- No.
		- 버틸 수 있을까?
		- 아니
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:38	Help me with the gate.
		Help me with the gate.
		문 좀 닫게 도와줘
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:59	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:01	It's me.
		It's Caroline.
		나야, 캐롤라인
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:04	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:12	Hey. Damon.
		데이먼
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	Hey.
		이봐
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	Damon.
		데이먼
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	Ahh.
		 
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	What the hell happened?
		대체 무슨 일이야?
00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:22	He's gone. He went to do
		the ritual. I'm sorry.
		갔어. 의식을 행하러
		미안해
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:25	I had to. He would have known that
		I was on vervain if I didn't do it.
		그래야 했어. 내가 따르지 않으면
		마편초를 마신걸 알테니까
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:29	Ahh. Do what?
		뭘 했는데?
