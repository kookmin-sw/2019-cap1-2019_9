00:00:00	Damon: Previously on
		"The Vampire Diaries"...
		뱀파이어 다이어리
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	- You must be Elena.
		- How do we look exactly alike?
		- 네가 엘레나구나
		- 어떻게 이리 닮은거죠?
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	You're a Petrova doppelganger.
		넌 페트로바의 도플갱어야
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	You're the key to breaking the curse.
		저주를 깨는 열쇠지
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	The Sun and the Moon curse?
		태양과 달의 저주요?
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	Vampires and werewolves
		used to roam freely
		뱀파이어와 늑대인간은
		자유롭게 노닐었지
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	until a shaman put a curse on
		them to limit their power.
		무당이 저주를 걸어
		그들의 힘을 억제하기 전까진
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	Klaus is the real deal.
		클라우스는 엄청난 존재야
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	From the first generation of vampires.
		1세대 뱀파이어지
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	The oldest vampire in the history
		of time is coming after me?
		역사상 가장 오래된 뱀파이어가
		날 뒤쫓고 있다구요?
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:19	Katerina, I have missed you.
		캐터리나, 그 동안 보고 싶었어
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	- Klaus!
		- Klaus is in Alaric's body.
		- 클라우스!
		- 클라우스는 알라릭 몸 안에 들어갔어
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	He's possessing it!
		귀신이 씌었다고
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	And while I'm gone,
		내가 없는 동안
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	you stay here, Katerina.
		넌 여기 있거라, 캐더리나
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Elijah.
		일라이자
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	One of the Originals.
		He's a legend.
		1세대 중 하나야
		전설이지
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	So that's it.
		그게 끝이야
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	As long as we keep
		the dagger in there,
		단도를 빼지만 않으면
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	then he stays dead.
		그대로 죽은 상태지
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
		일라이자는 클라우스를
		죽일 무기가 없었어
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	But he believed that if a witch
		could channel their power,
		하지만 마녀가 충분히
		힘을 통한다면
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	they wouldn't need one.
		무기가 필요 없으리라 믿었지
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	He says if you use too much
		of your powers at once,
		한꺼번에 많은 힘을 쓰게 되면
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	it'll kill you.
		죽을 수도 있대
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	Bonnie will not die for me.
		보니는 날 위해
		죽지 않을거에요
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:46	I will not let that happen.
		그렇게 두지 않을거죠
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	She's the only one who can do it.
		할 수 있는건
		그녀밖에 없는걸
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	Find another way.
		다른 방법을 찾으면 되죠
00:00:51

00:04:36	- Hey.
		- Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕하세요
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	- Have you seen Elena?
		- Uh, no.
		- 엘레나 못 봤어요?

00:04:43	Oh, my coffee.

00:04:44

		- 굿모닝
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	- Hey, where's Elena?
		- I don't know, Stefan.
		- 형, 엘레나 어디 있어?
		- 모르겠어, 스테판
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	It's your girlfriend.
		Mine's right here.
		네 여자친구잖아
		내껀 여기 있지
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	Oh, and how's the shoulder?
		Got time for a bite?
		어깨는 어때?
		물릴 시간 있나?
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:53	I'm so hungry.
		Oh, it's really messy.
		- 정말 배고파
		- 오늘은 말이 아냐
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	Can you just use a blood bag today?
		오늘은 대신 혈액팩 먹으면 안될까?

00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:05	[Scoffs] What are you doing?
		뭐 하는 거야?
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	She's not
		a wind-up toy.
		그녀는 태엽인형이 아니라고
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	It's really none of your
		business, is it, Stefan?
		네가 신경쓸 바가

00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	Yeah.
		그래
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	What she said.
		맞아
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:16	I have to go to work.
		일하러 가야 겠다
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	- Ugh! Bye.
		- Ok.
		- 안녕
		- 좋아
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:34	No, she didn't.
		설마 그럴리가

00:05:36	Maddox: I'll be back
		as soon as I can.
		가능한 빨리 오겠습니다
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	Yes, do hurry. I'm anxious
		to get out of this body.
		그래, 서두르게
		이 몸에서 빨리 벗어나고 싶으니까
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	And if you get hung up, call me.
		You know how impatient I get.
		전화 끊기면 전화주게
		내가 얼마나 급한지 알지
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:49	Where is he going?
		어디 가는거죠?
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:54	To retrieve me.
		날 부활시키러
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	So I can get out
		of this bad hair-do.
		이 구린 헤어스타일에서
		벗어나게끔
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Are you sure that's
		a good idea, Klaus?
		그게 정말 좋은 생각 같아요?
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	Well, the full moon is almost upon us.
		보름달이 곧 다가오는데다
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	I've killed the witch,
		I have the moon stone,
		마녀도 죽이고
		월장석도 갖고
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	and the doppelganger
		is waiting in the wings.
		도플갱어는 내 편에서
		대기 중이지
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	Ohh, I am ready to break this curse.
		저주를 풀 준비가 됐어
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	And why would you do that here?
		왜 여기서 하겠단 거죠?
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	There's so many people
		that would try to stop you.
		막으려는 사람이 많은데
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	Because I have to. It's the
		birth place of the doppelganger.
		그래야만 하니까
		도플갱어의 출생지거든
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	I didn't realize
		that was a requirement.
		그게 필요한 사항인줄
		몰랐네요
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	Well, how could you?
		You betrayed me
		어찌 알겠어?
		설명도 해주기 전에
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	and fled England before I could
		give you the details, Katerina.
		날 배신하고
		영국으로 도망쳤잖나, 캐터리나
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	But I did find your birth place
		하지만 난 출생지를 찾아서
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	and I slaughtered your family.
		네 가족을 학살했지
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	So I guess we're cool.
		그러니까 무승부야
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	Let's just hope that Elena
		제발 엘레나는
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	isn't as stupid as you are.
		너 만큼 멍청하지 않길 바라자고
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:48	She won't run.
		도망치지 않을거에요
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	She'll die before she lets anyone
		사랑하는 사람이
		다치기 전에
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	that she loves get hurt.
		직접 죽을 아이죠
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	And that's exactly
		what I'm counting on.
		그게 바로 내가
		기대하는 거야
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	You can't leave
		until I tell you to.
		내가 말하기 전까지
		이 집을 떠나지 마라
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:15	You look better.
		좀 나아 보이시네요
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	Where did you get the dagger?
		단도는 어디서 났지?
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	I'll tell you everything.
		다 말해줄게요
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	But we have to work
		together, Elijah.
		하지만 같이 협력해야 해요, 일라이자
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	I need your word.
		맹세해줘요
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	Your ability to make
		demands has long passed.
		요구할 수 있는 능력은
		이미 끝난지 오래네
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	No demands.
		요구가 아녜요
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	I'm offering you my help.
		돕겠단 거에요
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	And in return, I want yours.
		보답으로, 당신의 도움을 원해요
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	And why should
		I even consider this?
		왜 그걸 고려해야 하지?
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	The same reason that
		you haven't killed me.
		날 죽이지 않은
		이유와 같죠
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	You need my help to kill Klaus.
		클라우스를 죽이는데
		내 도움이 필요하죠
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	And I need you.
		난 당신이 필요하고
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	[Cell phone vibrating]
		 
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:48	Stefan: Where are you?
		어디야?
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:50	- Are you ok?
		- Yes, I'm fine.
		- 괜찮니?
		- 응, 괜찮아
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	- Where's Elijah?
		- He's right here.
		- 일라이자는?
		- 바로 여기 있어
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	Where? I'm on my way.
		어디? 바로 갈게
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	No, Stefan, Elijah and I
		need some time alone.
		아니, 스테판. 난
		일라이자와 단둘이 있고싶어
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	Listen to me.
		He can't be trusted.
		들어봐
		그를 믿으면 안돼
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	He'll use you to get to Klaus.
		클라우스에 접근하려
		널 이용할 거라구
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:06	Elijah is a noble man, Stefan.
		일라이자는
		귀족 출신이야
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:10	He lives by a code of honor.
		I can trust him.
		예법을 지키며 산다구
		그를 믿어
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:13	He knows that I'd be incredibly
		stupid to betray him again.
		그를 다시 배반하면
		정말 멍청한 짓일걸 그도 알지
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	By removing the dagger,
		I have proven myself.
		단도를 빼는 걸로
		난 스스로를 증명했어
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	- You can't do this alone.
		- It's my decision, Stefan.
		- 혼자 할 수 없어
		- 내 결정이야
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	Please respect it.
		제발 존중해줘
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	And make sure
		그리고 제발
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	that Damon doesn't
		do anything stupid.
		데이먼이 바보짓하지 않게 막아
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:29	We'll be in touch.
		연락할게
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:46	Did she just hang up on you?
		방금 그냥 끊었어?
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	- She did.
		- She's lost it.
		- 응
		- 미쳤군
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	If anyone can get him to help
		us kill Klaus, it's her.
		클라우스를 죽이는데
		도움을 줄 수 있는건 그녀 뿐야
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	Bonnie's the way
		to kill Klaus, Stefan.
		죽일 수 있는 건 보니지
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	He thinks she's dead.
		We have a chance with her.
		보니가 죽은 줄 알아
		가능성이 있다고
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	She'll kill herself in the process.
		Elena's looking for another way.
		그 과정에서 죽게 될거야
		다른 방법을 찾는 죽이지
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	Her way's going to get her killed.
		엘레나 방법대로면
		엘레나가 죽는거야
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	So we need to find her and stop her.
		그러니까 찾아서
		막아야 해
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	- No, you need to back off.
		- What?!
		- 아니, 물러나
		- 머?
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	Look, I don't like this
		any more than you do.
		봐, 나도 형만큼 싫어
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	But we need to trust her.
		We gotta just let her do her thing.
		믿어야만 해
		그냥 하게 둬
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	That might be your plan.
		Mine's better.
		그게 네 계획일지 몰라도
		내 계획이 나아
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:15	I said back off.
		물러나랬지
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:19	Elena: He's here.
		여기 있어요
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	Klaus is here?
		클라우스가?
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:24	He's taken over Alaric's body.
		알라릭의 몸 속에 들어갔어요
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Of course he has.
		그랬겠지
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:29	One of his favorite tricks.
		좋아하던 묘기였으니
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	Well, what are his other tricks?
		다른 능력은 뭐가 있죠?
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	What is he going to do next?
		다음엔 어떤 짓을 할까요?
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	You're the only one who knows him.
		그를 아는 건
		당신 뿐이에요
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:39	Yes, I do.
		알아
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:40	So where is this mysterious host
		계속 소문으로 듣던
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	I've heard so much about?
		미스터리한 주인공은
		어디에 있나요?
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	Fashionably late.
		티 나게 늦는군
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	He likes to make an entrance.
		거하게 행차하는 걸 좋아하지
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:51	Here he is.
		저기 오네
00:09:53	 
		 
00:10:16	Katerina, may I introduce to you
		캐터리나, 소개하죠
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	the lord Niklaus.
		클라우스 남작님을
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:30	Niklaus is the name
		my father gave me.
		닉클라우스는
		아버지가 정한 이름이오
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:33	Please.
		제발
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	Call me Klaus.
		클라우스라 부르게
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:52	Elijah!
		일라이자!
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	Elena, what are you doing here?
		엘레나, 여긴 왠 일이니?
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	What happened?
		어떻게 된거야?
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	I've had a bit of
		an incident, Carol.
		사고가 있었어요, 캐롤
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	I'm hoping you could help.
		좀 도와주시길 바랍니다
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	Well, I'm on my way
		to a meeting, so I--
		회의에 가려는 중인데
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	We won't take but a
		minute of your time.
		별로 안 걸릴겁니다
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:05	Of course.
		Anything you need.
		물론요
		필요하신건 뭐든지 말하세요
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	Well, first things first.
		우선 중요한 것 부터
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	I'm going to need
		a change of clothing.
		옷 좀 갈아입어야 겠는데요
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	Well, we can try
		one of my husband's suits.
		남편 양복을 입어보는 게 어때요
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	I haven't boxed them up yet.
		아직 정리 안 해 놨어요
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	Wonderful.
		좋습니다
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	How did you know
		she's not on vervain?
		어떻게 마편초를 안 먹은걸 알았죠?
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	'Cause I'm the one
		who got her off it.
		끊게 만든게
		바로 나니까
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	Right before you
		and your friends
		너랑 네 친구들이
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	killed me. Twice.
		날 두번씩인
		죽이기 전에
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	If you'll excuse me.
		I'll be done in a moment.
		실례하지만
		곧 돌아오지
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:37	- Hello?
		- Hey, Stefan.
		- 여보세요?
		- 안녕, 스테판
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	- It's Jenna.
		- Jenna, hey.
		- 나 제나야
		- 안녕하세요
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:39	Where's Elena?
		And Jeremy?
		엘레나 어디갔니?
		제레미는?
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	No one's answering their phones.
		아무도 전화를 안 받아
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	Ah, Elena's not here
		at the moment. Is, uh,
		엘레나는 지금 없어요
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	is everything ok?
		무슨 일 있어요?
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	She left me all these weird messages
		telling me to stay away from Rick.
		릭을 멀리하라는
		이상한 메세지들을 보내서
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	What's going on?
		무슨 일이니?
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	It's really hard to explain
		over the phone, but, um,
		전화로 얘기하기
		힘든 거겠지만
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	she was hoping that you could stay
		on campus for a little while longer.
		엘레나는 좀 더 캠퍼스에서
		머무시길 바라요
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	Oh, that's kinda hard
		to do from my kitchen.
		우리 집 식탁이라
		그러기 힘들다
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Wait, you're home?
		그럼 집에 계신단 말인가요?
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	Yeah. What's going on?
		Where's Elena?
		그래. 무슨 일이니?
		엘레나는?
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	I'm supposed to meet Rick
		at the grill for lunch,
		점심때 그릴에서
		릭을 보기로 했는데
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	to talk. Jenna,
		listen to me carefully.
		제나, 잘 들어요
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	Whatever you do, do not
		meet Alaric at the grill.
		뭘 하든지
		알라릭은 만나지 마요
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	I'm going to come over right now
		and I'll explain everything.
		당장 거기 가서
		다 설명해드릴게요
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	Wow, I'd love to lend you a hand,
		돕고 싶지만
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	but you wouldn't want me
		doing anything stupid.
		바보짓하길 원치 않으니
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:18	Seriously going to be like this?
		정말 계속 이럴거야?
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	You and your girlfriend
		are calling the shots.
		너랑 네 여친이
		결정하는데로 따라야지
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	I'm just backing off, Stefan.
		물러나 있는거야, 스테판
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	[Scoffs]
		 
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:28	- Hi.
		- Hi.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	- Let's go.
		- Where are we going?
		- 어서 가자
		- 어디 가게?
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	Splitting from the team.
		Going rogue.
		무리에서 벗어나서
		헤매러
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	- Come on.
		- Ok.
		- 어서
		- 좋아
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	So I assume that the Martin
		witches are no longer with us.
		마틴 마녀들은
		더이상 우리 곁에 없군
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	No.
		네
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	I'm sorry.
		안됐어요
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	And Katerina.
		캐터리나도
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	She would have been released
		from my compulsion when I died.
		내가 죽을 때
		내 마법에서 풀렸을거야
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Klaus took her.
		클라우스가 데려갔어요
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:56	We think that she may be dead.
		죽었을지 모른다 생각해요
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:57	I doubt that.
		글쎄
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Not Klaus' style.
		클라우스 스타일이 아냐
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	Death would be too easy
		for her after what she did.
		그녀가 한 짓을 보면
		쉽게 죽이지 않을걸
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	I don't understand.
		이해가 안 가요
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	You say that you want Klaus dead,
		클라우스가 죽길 바라면서
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	but you still made Katherine
		pay for betraying him.
		클라우스를 배반한 캐터린이
		벌을 받게 만들었잖아요
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	I have my own reasons
		for wanting Katerina to pay.
		난 캐터리나가 벌 받길 바라는
		다른 이유가 있어
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	There was a time...
		한 때는..
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	I'd have done anything for Klaus.
		난 클라우스를 위해
		뭐든지 했지
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	From where have
		you come, Katerina?
		어디 출신이지?
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	I'm new to town, my lord.
		온 지 얼마 안됐습니다, 각하
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	Katerina is from Bulgaria.
		캐터리나는 불가리아 출신이야
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Zradevei, Katerina.
		Zradevei, 캐터리나
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	[Laughs]
		 
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	Very good.
		아주 잘 하시네요
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:39	Do you mind, brother?
		잠시만 실례해도?
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	I would like to have a
		moment alone with her.
		그녀와 단둘이 있고 싶네
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	Not at all.
		Happy Birthday, brother.
		물론
		생일 축하해
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:51	Yes.
		 
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	Klaus is my brother.
		클라우스는 내 형제야
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	I heard that.
		들었어요
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	I'm still processing.
		아직 처리중이죠
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	Yes, I'm a little
		behind on the times,
		그래, 내가 약간 시대에
		뒤쳐졌을지 몰라도
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	but I believe the term
		you're searching for
		자네가 찾고 싶은 말은
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	is "O.M.G."
		'헐'이겠지
		(O.M.G: Oh, My God 의 줄임말)
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:10	[Music playing]
		 
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:25	Andie: I really don't think
		that this is a good idea.
		별로 좋은 생각같지 않아
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	Damon: You're an investigative journalist.
		We're investigating.
		- 당신은 취재 기자잖아
		- 조사 중이고
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	[Music playing inside]
		 
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:37	Alaric, are you home?
		알라릭, 온거에요?
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	Andie-- Starr,
		Jenna's friend.
		앤디 스타에요
		제나 친구요
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	[Exhaling]
		 
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:58	Thank God.
		이런
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	Wow! You were right.
		와, 자기 말이 맞네
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:02	She looks exactly like Elena.
		엘레나랑 똑 닮았어
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Yep.
		그렇지
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Thought you might be dead.
		죽은 줄 알았는데
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	Unfortunately not.
		안타깝게 아니지
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	Hey, Jenna.
		Thank you so much
		제나
		정말 고마워요
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	for not going to the grill.
		그릴에 가지 않아서
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	- Um, Stefan--
		- No, listen.
		- 스테판--
		- 아니, 들어봐요
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	I can explain.
		설명할게요
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:21	Hi, Stefan.
		스테판
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:25	How's it going?
		잘 있었니?
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:31	There's a whole
		family of Originals?
		1세대 뱀파이어
		가문이 있다구요?
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	My father was a wealthy land owner
		in a village in eastern Europe.
		우리 아버지는 동부 유럽
		한 마을의 부유한 지주였지
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	Our mother bore seven children.
		어머니는 자식 7명을 낳았어
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	So your parents were human?
		부모님은 인간이었나요?
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	Our whole family was.
		우리 가족 모두가 인간이었지
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	Our origin as vampires
		is a very long story, Elena.
		우리가 뱀파이어가 된 기원은
		아주 얘기가 길단다
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	Just know... We're the oldest
		vampires in the world.
		그저 알아두렴.. 우리가
		세계에서 가장 오래된 뱀파이어란걸
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	We are the Original family,
		우린 원조 뱀파이어 가문이야
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	and from us all,
		vampires were created.
		우리들로부터
		뱀파이어가 태어났지
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	Right, but Klaus is your brother.
		맞다, 하지만
		클라우스는 당신 형이잖아요
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	And you want him dead?
		죽길 바라고?
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	I need some air.
		바람 좀 쐬야겠어
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:04	I'm still feeling
		a tad... dead.
		아직도 약간 죽은 듯한 기분이야
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	Come.
		따라오게
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:12	Katherine: What
		are you doing here?
		여긴 왠일이죠?
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	We are here to rescue you.
		구하러 왔어요
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	No, sweetie. We are here to see
		if she deserves to be rescued.
		아니, 우린 구할 가치가
		있는지 보러 왔지
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	Right.
		맞다
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	I figured you
		still might be kicking.
		아직 활개칠줄 알았어
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	Alari-Klaus was blending
		was too easily.
		알라릭과 클라우스는
		너무 쉽게 어울리더군
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Figured he had probably
		had some coaching.
		전문가의 코치를 받은 것 같던데
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	Is that...
		그거...
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	Vervain? Your salvation.
		마편초? 널 구원할 약이지
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	It's not going to undo anything.
		그런다고 예전처럼
		되돌아가는 건 없어
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	There's always a loophole.
		Did he tell you
		그 말에 허점이 있어
		클라우스가
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	to stay in this apartment until
		he said it was ok to leave?
		떠나도 괜찮다고 할 때까지
		이 집에 있으랬지?
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:43	You can't say.
		Did he tell you to do
		말 못 하지
		그럼 클라우스가
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	absolutely everything he says
		until the end of time?
		명령한 모든걸 영원히
		따르라고 했나?
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	- No.
		- There's your loophole.
		- 아니
		- 빠져나올 구멍이 있군
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	Drink this and prevent
		any further compulsion.
		이걸 마시면 추가적인
		주문은 막을 수 있을거야
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:58	Give it to me.
		이리 내놔
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	Answer one question first.
		한 가지부터 답해
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	You double-crossed us
		with Isobel, why?
		이자벨과 같이
		두번이나 배반을 한 이유는?
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	I didn't think you could stand
		a chance against Klaus,
		클라우스를 이길
		가능성은 없으니까
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	so I was looking out for myself.
		내 몸 좀 사린거지
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	And where did that get you?
		그래서 어찌 되셨나?
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:13	Here.
		여기
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	Be careful with that.
		조심해
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	If he finds out you have that,
		네가 가진걸 알면
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	you're never getting out of here.
		여기서 평생 못 나올테니
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:21	[Coughing]
		 
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	You owe me.
		나한테 신세진거야
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:25	And I will collect.
		보답을 받으러 올거고
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:28	Come on.
		어서 가자
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:32	Nice to meet you.
		만나서 반가웠어요
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:39	You know, I find chopping...
		칼로 뭔가를 잘게 자르는게
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	Calming.
		마음을 평화롭게 하더군
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:45	The feel of the blade
		in the hand, maybe.
		손에 닿은 칼날의 느낌 탓인가
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:49	I'm still waiting for someone to
		tell me what the hell's going on.
		누군가 대체 어떻게 된건지
		답해주길 기다리는 중이야
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	Well, would you like
		그러면
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	to tell her, Stefan,
		or should I?
		네가 말할래, 스테판?
		아님 내가?
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	Tell me what?
		뭘 말한다고?
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Do you believe
		in vampires, Jenna?
		뱀파이어를 믿어, 제나?
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	No? [Chuckles]
		아니야?
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	Well, who does, right?
		But believe it or not,
		누가 믿겠어
		믿거나 말거나
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	they do have a plac
		in our history.
		우리 역사의 한 구석을 차지하지
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	And as a history teacher,
		역사 선생으로
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	I find them fascinating.
		참 매혹적인 얘기 같아
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:18	Why are we talking about this?
		왜 그 얘길 하는거야?
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	Well, you've been angry
		with me for keeping secrets,
		비밀을 감추는걸
		열받아 있었지
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	and this is one of my secrets.
		내 비밀 중 하나야
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	I'm obsessed with vampires.
		난 뱀파이어에 미쳐있어
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	[Chuckles] There.
		봐
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	I said it.
		[Laughs]
		말했네
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	Are you joking?
		농담이지?
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	Not at all.
		전혀
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	How about you, Stefan?
		넌 어떠니, 스테판?
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	Are you a fan of vampires?
		뱀파이어 팬이니?
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	In literature.
		문학은 좋아해요
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	Bram stoker.
		브램 스토커
		(드라큘라 작가)
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	It's dense, but I appreciate it.
		극단적인 얘기지만
		좋아하죠
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	Hmm. Did you know
		that vampires are
		그럼 너 뱀파이어가
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	the oldest creatures of the night?
		어둠의 가장 오래된 창조물이란걸 아나?
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	Except for werewolves, of course.
		물론 늑대인간은 빼고
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	Werewolves.
		늑대인간이라
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	Werewolves.
		늑대인간
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	Now I know you're joking.
		농담하는구나
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	You know, I've read that
		there's an Aztec curse
		읽었는데
		아즈텍 저주에
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	on both species.
		두 종족에 대한
		얘기가 있다지
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	That keeps werewolves
		slaves to the Moon
		늑대인간은 달의 노예며
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	and vampires bound by the Sun.
		뱀파이어는 햇빛에 약해진다고
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	Isn't that right, Stefan?
		맞지, 스테판?
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	You know, they say these creatures
		있지, 그 책에선
		그 창조물들은
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	would do anything to
		have this curse broken.
		저주를 깨기 위해
		뭐든지 할거래
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	And that they wouldn't care
		그리고 깨기 위해
		누굴 죽여야 한대도
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	who they had to kill to do it.
		신경쓰지 않는다고
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	Elijah: So as you've seen,
		봤다시피
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:27	nothing can kill an Original.
		1세대 뱀파이어를
		죽일 수 있는 건 없어
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	Not Sun, not fire,
		not even a werewolf bite.
		태양도 불도
		늑대인간에 물려도
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	Only the wood from one tree.
		한가지 나무만이 가능하지
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	A tree my family made sure burned.
		내 가족이 확실히
		불에 태운 나무만
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	That's where the white ash
		그래서 단도와 같이 쓰는
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	- for the dagger comes from.
		- Yes.
		- 하얀 재가 있었군요
		- 그래
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	The witches won't allow anything
		truly immortal to walk the earth.
		마녀들은 땅을 걷는 생물은
		완벽한 불멸이 되지 않게 만들었지
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	Every creature needs
		to have a weakness
		모든 생명체는
		약점이 있었어
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	in order to maintain the balance.
		균형을 유지하기 위해
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	So the Sun can't kill an Original.
		태양으로도 1세대를 죽일 수 없다
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	Why is Klaus so obsessed
		그럼 왜 클라우스는
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	with breaking the
		Sun and Moon curse?
		태양과 달의 저주를
		깨는 데 혈안이 되있죠?
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	Right.
		맞아
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	The curse of the
		Sun and the Moon.
		태양과 달의 저주
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	It's all so...
		Biblical-sounding,
		그건 참.. 성경에서 나올법한 이야기지
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	don't you think?
		그렇지 않아?
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	What's so funny?
		뭐가 그리 재미있으시죠?
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:09	Look what I found.
		내가 뭘 찾았게
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	The Roman parchment.
		로마자 양피지
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:20	I remember etching this scroll.
		이걸 새기던 때가 기억나네
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:25	Well, I was quite
		blistered from drink.
		술에 꽤 취해 있었지
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	Your finest work remains
		your Aztec drawings.
		형의 가장 훌륭한 작품은
		아즈텍 그림이지
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	Not the African carvings?
		'Cause I was quite proud of those.
		아프리카식 조각물은?
		그것도 만들고 뿌듯했는데
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	The Aztec.
		아즈텍 그림이 낫지
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	Who can resist a shaman?
		누가 무당을 거부할 수 있겠어?
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	[Laughs]
		 
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:39	Yes.
		그래
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:41	I don't understand.
		이해가 안가요
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	So Klaus drew the Aztec
		sketches about the curse?
		클라우스가 아즈텍의 저주에
		대한 그림을 그렸다구요?
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	Roman scrolls,
		African tribal etchings,
		로마 양피지 문서나
		아프리카 부족 조각
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	and any other culture or continent
		we felt like planting in it.
		어떤 문화나 대륙이던
		집어넣고 싶은 생각이 드는건 뭐든
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	But why?
		왜요?
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Easiest way to discover
		the existence
		도플갱어의 존재를
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	of a doppelganger
		or to get your hands
		발견하는 거나
		오래전 잃어버린
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	on some long,
		lost moon stone
		월장석을 손에 넣으려면
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	is to have every single member
		of two warring species
		두 적대적 종족의
		모든 일원을
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	on the lookout.
		경계하게 만들어야 했지
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	So it's not Aztec at all?
		그럼 실제 아즈텍 전설이 아니다?
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:12	The curse of the sun
		and the Moon... is fake.
		태양과 달의 저주는
		가짜야
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:19	It doesn't exist.
		존재하지 않지
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:22	What?
		뭐라고요?
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	Oh, I know this
		all sounds so crazy,
		다 정신나간 소리로 들리겠지만
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	but... vampires are real.
		뱀파이어는 진짜 존재해
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:34	Would you care for some more wine?
		와인 좀 마실래?
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	- Get out.
		- Excuse me?
		- 나가
		- 뭐라고?
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	I don't know what it is
		you're trying to do
		뭘 하려는 건지 모르겠어
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	or why you're
		saying these things, but--
		왜 그런 말을 하는지도..
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	- Jenna--
		- I said get out!
		- 제나--
		- 나가랬지?
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:51	You heard her.
		들었죠
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:52	I'm afraid I don't want to.
		글쎄 그러고 싶지 않네
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:55	Fine! I'll go.
		좋아, 내가 나가지
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:58	You're not going anywhere.
		아무데도 못가
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:01	[Groaning] Stefan!
		스테판!
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	Jenna, get out of here now!
		제나, 당장 나가요!
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	- You can't kill me, Stefan.
		- Watch me!
		- 난 못 죽여, 스테판
		- 어디 보지!
00:22:06	 
		 
00:22:06	Stefan!
		스테판
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	I may not have a witch
		protecting me today,
		오늘 날 지켜줄
		마녀가 없을지 몰라도
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	but if you kill this body,
		이 몸을 죽이면
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	what's to stop me
		from choosing Jenna
		그 다음으로
		제나 몸을 택할지
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	- as my next one?
		- Jenna, go.
		- 누가 알아?
		- 제나, 당장 도망쳐요
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	But you're-- you--
		하지만 넌..
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	I said go!
		도망치랬죠!
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:22	Kill me.
		날 죽여
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	Just remind Elena how easy it
		will be for me to get my revenge
		엘레나가 저주를 깨려는 날
		막는 짓을 하면
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	if she tries to stop me
		from breaking this curse.
		그 보복이 얼마나
		쉬운지 보여주게
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:43	Klaus and I faked
		the Sun and Moon curse
		클라우스와 난 태양과 달의 저주를
		거짓으로 만들었어
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:45	dating back over
		a thousand years.
		천 년 전으로 거슬러 올라가지
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:47	But if there's no curse...
		하지만 저주가 없다면..
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	There's a curse.
		Just not that one.
		저주는 있어
		그 저주가 아닐 뿐이지
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	The real one's much worse.
		실제 저주는
		더 심하지
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:54	It's a curse placed on Klaus.
		클라우스만이 걸린 저주지
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	What are you talking about?
		무슨 말이죠?
00:22:58	 
		 
00:22:58	Klaus has been trying to break
		it for the last thousand years.
		클라우스는 몇 천 년간
		저주를 깨려 노력했어
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	You were his only hope.
		[Cell phone vibrating]
		네가 유일한 희망이었지
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	What is this curse?
		그건 무슨 저주죠?
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:05	[Vibrating continues]
		 
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:08	Your phone will not stop
		its incessant buzzing.
		네 전화기는 끊임없이 울리는 구나
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:11	Answer it, please.
		받아 어서
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	[Sighs] Stefan--
		스테판--
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	what's wrong?
		무슨 일이야?
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:21	No.
		아니
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:22	No, no, no, no.
		안돼
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:24	Ok, I'll be right there.
		바로 갈게
00:23:26	 
		 
00:23:27	Klaus went after Jenna.
		I have to go to her.
		클라우스가 제나를 찾아갔어요
		가봐야 해요
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	I'm afraid that wasn't part
		of today's arrangement.
		오늘 약속에는
		없었는줄 아는데
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	She's my family,
		Elijah. I have to.
		우리 가족이에요
		일라이자. 가봐야만 해요
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	I'll be back.
		돌아올게요
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	You have my word.
		맹세해요
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:43	That doesn't mean
		anything to me
		지키지 않으면
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	until you live up to it.
		맹세는 소용 없네
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	[Sighs] Thank you.
		고마워요
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:58	You have to chase me!
		[Laughing]
		나 잡아봐라!
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:01	You're meant to catch me.
		날 잡아야 하는데
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	But if I catch you,
		the game will be over.
		잡으면 게임이 끝나잖소
00:24:06	 
		 
00:24:06	[Exhales]
		 
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:08	Thank you for entertaining me.
		즐겁게 해줘 고마워요
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:10	You seemed lonely inside,
		so I took pity on you.
		속으로 외로운 것 같아 보여
		동정을 느꼈소
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:16	Klaus promised to spend
		the day with me,
		클라우스는 오늘 하루
		나와 함께하기로 약속했는데
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:19	but he never returned
		home from the night.
		어젯밤 이후로
		집에 돌아오지 않네요
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:22	Yes, Klaus does not live
		by any rules but his own.
		그래, 클라우스는
		자기 방식대로만 살죠
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	He is a very charming man.
		아주 멋진 분이세요
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	Hard for anyone to resist,
		I suppose.
		어떤 여성도 거부하기 힘들겠죠
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	And yet...
		하지만..
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	I know not why he courts me.
		왜 나한테 구혼하지 않는지 모르겠어요
00:24:38	 
		 
00:24:38	He seems to not care
		about me at all.
		날 전혀 좋아하는 것 같지 않구요
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:41	Many a union has been
		built on much less.
		아직 그럴 단계는 아닌것 같네
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	Is it wrong to want more?
		더 원하는 게 잘못된건가요?
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	Did you have more with Trefor?
		트레버는 어떻게 생각하오?
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	Trefor believes
		that he loves me,
		트레버는 날 사랑한다 믿지만
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	but true love is not real
		unless it's returned.
		상대방이 마음에 없다면
		진실한 사랑은 아니죠
00:24:57	 
		 
00:24:57	Do you agree?
		내 말에 동의하나요?
00:24:59	 
		 
00:25:00	I do not believe
		in love, Katerina.
		난 사랑을 믿지 않소, 캐터리나
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	That is too sad for me
		to accept, my lord.
		받아들이기 슬프네요, 각하
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:07	Life is too cruel.
		인생은 참 잔인하죠
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:10	If we cease to believe in love,
		사랑을 믿지 않는다면
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:12	why would we want to live?
		어찌 살고 싶을까요?
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:18	[Footsteps]
		 
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:20	- What do I interrupt?
		- He's returned.
		- 내가 방해가 되려나?
		- 돌아왔군
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:24	Long night.
		긴 밤을 보냈군
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	What has happened?
		어떻게 된거죠?
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:29	The wrong village picked
		a fight at the tavern.
		선술집에서 어떤 이가
		싸움을 걸었소
00:25:33	 
		 
00:26:02	Oh, Jenna, thank God.
		제나 이모, 다행이다
00:26:04	 
		 
00:26:04	No.
		아니
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:08	I'm so sorry.
		정말 미안해
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	I never meant for any
		of this to happen.
		이런 일이 일어나길 원치 않았는데
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	When I was little, your mom used
		to tell me bedtime stories.
		내가 어릴 때, 너희 엄마는
		자기 전에 이야기를 해줬어
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	Stories about vampires.
		뱀파이어에 관한 얘기
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:20	I never thought that what
		she said could be true.
		난 그게 사실일지 몰랐어
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	It is true, Jenna.
		진짜 존재해, 제나
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	I should have told you.
		말했어야 하는데
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:30	I thought that if you
		didn't know, you'd be safe.
		모르는게 안전할 것 같았어
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	But then things got
		so out of control
		그러다가 상황이
		통제 불능이 되고
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	and everything I had done
		to keep you out of it,
		이모한테서 숨기려
		했던 모든 일들이
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	it just blew up in my face.
		다시 내 앞에
		되돌아오더라
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	Who else knows?
		또 누가 알아?
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:44	Jeremy?
		제레미?
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:50	John?
		존?
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:52	We were just trying
		to protect you.
		이모를 지키려 했어
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	- Protect me?
		- I'm so sorry.
		- 지키려고?
		- 정말 미안해
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	I will tell you everything.
		다 말해줄게
00:26:58	 
		 
00:26:58	No, Elena... I am the one who's
		supposed to be protecting you
		아니, 엘레나
		널 보호할건 바로 나야
00:27:02	 
		 
00:27:02	- and Jeremy.
		- I know, but there's
		- 제레미도
		- 알아, 근데
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	nothing that you could have done.
		There's so much more to it--
		달리 방법이 없었어
		너무 많은 일이..
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	no, this is--
		this is so--
		정말.. 이건
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	- I don't know how-- it's--
		- I know, hey.
		- 어떻게 말해야 할지
		- 알아
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	Why didn't you tell me?!
		왜 말 안한거야?
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:19	I'm scared.
		무서워
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:20	I know.
		알아
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:24	I know.
		알아
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:25	I know, hey.
		알아
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	Hey.
		이모
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:32	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:35	Jenna, I am so, so sorry.
		이모, 정말 미안
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:56	Is she gonna be ok?
		괜찮아질까?
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:57	She's in shock.
		충격을 받았어
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	I tried to tell her
		as much as I could,
		최대한 다 말하려 했어
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	but I barely scratched
		the surface.
		하지만 본론도 못 들어갔네
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:05	I'm so sorry, Elena.
		정말 미안, 엘레나
00:28:07	 
		 
00:28:07	I hate this.
		진짜 싫다
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	It's not your fault, Stefan.
		네 탓이 아냐, 스테판
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	It's mine.
		내 탓이지
00:28:14	 
		 
00:28:14	Anyway...
		어쨌건...
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	I have to go back.
		다시 가봐야 겠어
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:19	To Elijah.
		일라이자한테
00:28:21	 
		 
00:28:21	Wait, what? No, no!
		잠깐만, 뭐?
		안돼
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:23	Stefan, I promised him
		that I would return.
		스테판, 돌아가리라 약속했어
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	I can't break that promise.
		약속을 깰 수 없다고
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:29	Oh.
		 
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	Yeah.
		 
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:35	I'll be ok.
		괜찮을거야
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:40	Where do you think you're going?
		어디 가려고?
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:42	- Back to Elijah.
		- No.
		- 일라이자한테요
		- 안돼지
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	Get out of my way, Dam...
		당장 비켜줘요
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	if you so much as try
		and take a step
		이 집 밖으로
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	out of this house...
		한 걸음만 디뎌도
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	Damon, easy.
		데이먼, 진정해
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	- Stay out of this, Andie.
		- Let her go.
		- 비켜있어, 앤디
		- 놔줘
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:53	Are you kidding me?
		We just got her back.
		농담이지?
		이제 돌아왔는데
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:55	You heard me.
		들었잖아
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	I said let her go.
		놔주라고
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:01	That's twice today
		you've stood in my way.
		오늘 날 두번째로
		가로막는군
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	I wouldn't try a third.
		한 번 더 시도해봐라
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:07	[Music playing loudly]
		 
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:35	[Music continues]
		 
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:38	You mind turning that down?
		그것 좀 줄일래?
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:42	[Turns music down]
		 
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:44	Why so grumpy?
		왜 그리 표정이 안좋죠?
00:29:45	 
		 
00:29:45	Well, this body has
		outlived its usefulness.
		이 몸은 한계에 도달했어
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:49	Do you want a drink?
		술 마실래요?
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	No, Katerina,
		I don't want a drink.
		아니, 캐터리나
		난 술이 필요 없어
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	Come on. It might
		loosen you up.
		왜요, 기분도 좀 풀겸
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	[Gasping]
		 
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	What I want
		내가 원하는건
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	is for you to sit down
		앉아서
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	and shut up.
		입 다물고 있는거다
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:12	Maddox, what took you so long?
		매덕스, 왜 이리 오래 걸렸나?
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	You've got a lot of luggage.
		가방이 참 많더군요
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:24	Greta. Finally.
		그레타. 마침내 왔군
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	Hello, love.
		안녕, 내 사랑
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:30	Nice body.
		멋진데
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:33	You ready to get out of it?
		나올 준비 됐어?
00:30:35	 
		 
00:31:01	Welcome back.
		돌아온 거 환영하네
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:05	Tell me.
		말해줘요
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:07	What is Klaus' curse?
		클라우스의 저주는 뭐였죠?
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:12	Please.
		제발
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:20	My family was quite close,
		우리 가족은
		꽤 가까웠지
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:23	but Klaus and my father
		did not get on too well.
		하지만 클라우스와 아버지는
		그다지 친밀하지 않았지
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:25	When we became vampires,
		뱀파이어가 됐을때
00:31:27	 
		 
00:31:27	we discovered the truth.
		사실을 알았지
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	Klaus was not my father's son.
		클라우스는 우리 아버지
		아들이 아녔어
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:33	My mother had been unfaithful
		many years before.
		어머니는 몇 년 전부터
		불륜을 저지르고 있었지
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	This was her darkest secret.
		어두운 비밀이었어
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	Klaus is from
		a different bloodline.
		클라우스는 다른 혈통 출신이었지
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	Of course, when my father
		discovered this,
		물론, 아버지가
		이 사실을 발견했을 때
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	he hunted down and he
		killed my mother's lover
		어머니의 애인을 쫓아가 죽였지
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	and his entire family.
		그의 가족 모두도
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	Not realizing, of course,
		깨닫지 못한건
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	that he was igniting
		a war between species
		종족간의 전쟁의
		불씨가 됐다는 거지
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	that rages until this day.
		현재까지 계속되고 있고
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:55	A war between the species?
		종족간의 전쟁요?
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	The vampires...
		뱀파이어와
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	And the werewolves.
		늑대인간
00:32:03	 
		 
00:32:04	So Klaus' real father
		was from a werewolf bloodline?
		그럼 클라우스의 친아버지는
		늑대인간 혈통인가요?
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:11	What does that make Klaus?
		그럼 클라우스는
		어떤 존재인거죠?
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:14	A werewolf?
		늑대인간?
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:17	Or a vampire?
		뱀파이어?
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:21	He's both.
		둘 다야
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:29	A hybrid would be deadlier
		혼혈종은 더 치명적이지
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	than any werewolf or vampire.
		어떤 늑대인간이나
		뱀파이어보다도
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:32	Nature would not stand for
		such an imbalance of power.
		자연은 그런 힘의 불균형을
		허락치 않았지
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	Therefore the witches,
		the servants of nature,
		자연의 하인인
		마녀들은 그래서
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	saw to it that my
		brother's werewolf side
		내 형의 늑대인간적인 면을
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	would become dormant.
		쓰지 못하게 만들었지
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	That's the curse
		that Klaus wants to break?
		그게 클라우스가 깨려든
		저주인가요?
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	He wants to trigger that part
		of him that's a werewolf.
		늑대인간의 면을
		끌어내려는 거지
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:48	If allowed, Klaus would
		sire his own bloodline.
		가능하다면 자신만의 혈통을
		창시할 수 있어
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	He'd build his own race.
		자신만의 종족을
		만드는 거지
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	Endangering not just vampires,
		뱀파이어를 멸종시킬 뿐 아니라
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	- but everyone.
		- But you helped him.
		- 모든 종족을 멸종시킬수 있지
		- 하지만 그를 도왔잖아요
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	I helped him
		because I loved him.
		그를 사랑해서 도와준거야
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	That's changed,
		now he must die.
		이제 내 맘이 변했어
		죽어야 하지
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	We have the dagger now.
		We can stop him.
		단도가 있잖아요
		이제 멈출 수 있어요
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	When a werewolf
		is wounded by silver,
		늑대인간은 은으로 만든 물건으로
		상처를 받으면
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	it heals.
		회복되지
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:09	An Original can't be
		killed by anything
		원조 뱀파이어는 죽을 수 없어
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:11	but white oak ash
		on a silver dagger.
		하얀 재와 은으로 만든 단도가 아니라면
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:13	So you see the conundrum.
		왜 어려운지 알겠지
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	The dagger does not work.
		단도는 통하지 않을거라네
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	What, are you saying
		that Klaus can't be killed?
		클라우스는 죽일 수 없단 건가요?
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:17	There's one way to kill any
		supernatural species--
		초자연적 종족을
		죽이는 한가지 방법이 있어
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	at the hands of the serpents
		of nature themselves.
		자연의 하인의 손에
		직접 죽는거지
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:24	A witch.
		마녀 말이죠
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:26	If they can channel
		that much power.
		많은 힘을
		통할 수만 있다면 말이죠
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:31	[Sighs] But it would kill them.
		하지만 죽을 수도 있어요
00:33:34	 
		 
00:33:34	The curse must be broken
		during the full moon.
		저주는 보름달이 뜰 때
		깨져야만 해
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	When Klaus is in transition.
		클라우스가 변이 중일 때 말이지
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:38	That's when he'll be
		at his most vulnerable.
		그 때가 가장
		약해지는 때니까
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:41	A witch with enough power...
		충분한 힘을 가진 마녀는
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	Can kill Klaus.
		클라우스를 죽일 수 있지
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	What if I told you
		만약에
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:50	that I knew a witch
		그 정도의 힘을 합칠
		마녀를 안다면요?
00:33:52	 
		그 정도의 힘을 합칠
		마녀를 안다면요?
00:33:52	that could channel
		that much power?
		그 정도의 힘을 합칠
		마녀를 안다면요?
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	Then I would tell you there's one
		more thing that you should know.
		그럼 알아야 하는 게
		한가지 더 있지
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:59	The full moon is tomorrow, brother.
		동생, 보름달이 내일 뜨는군
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	After all these centuries,
		it is finally time.
		몇 세기를 기다리고
		마침내 때가 왔어
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	I have been to see the witches.
		마녀를 보러 갔다 왔어
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:09	They believe they may
		have found a way
		도플갱어를 살릴
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:11	to spare the doppelganger.
		방법을 찾은 것 같아
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	What does it matter
		if she lives or not?
		그녀가 죽든 살든
		뭐가 중요하지?
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:17	She's a means to an end,
		that is all.
		그녀는 목적을
		이루려는 수단일 뿐야
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	What, she should die
		for your gain?
		형의 이득을 위해
		죽어야 한다?
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	She is human.
		그녀는 인간이야
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:23	Her life means nothing.
		그녀의 목숨은
		아무 의미 없지
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	I beg you to consider this.
		다시 생각해봐
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:31	Are you so foolish
		정말 바보같이
00:34:33	 
		 
00:34:33	as to care for her?
		그녀를 좋아하는 거야?
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:36	Of course not.
		물론 아니야
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	Love is a vampire's
		greatest weakness,
		사랑은 뱀파이어의 가장 큰 약점이지
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:42	and we are not weak, Elijah.
		우린 약하지 않아, 일라이자
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	We do not feel,
		우린 감정을 느낄 수 없어
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	and we do not care.
		좋아할 수도 없지
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	We did once.
		한 때는 그랬잖아
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:56	Too many lifetimes
		ago to matter.
		너무 오래 전 일이야
00:34:59	 
		 
00:34:59	Tell the witches not to bother.
		마녀한테
		신경 끄라고 해
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	The sacrifice
		will happen as planned.
		계획대로 제물을 바칠테니까
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	You found a way to save the
		life of the doppelganger?
		도플갱어의 목숨을
		살리는 방법을 찾았나요?
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:10	Yes, Elena.
		그래
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	I did.
		그랬지
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	But unfortunately,
		하지만 불행히
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	Katerina took matters
		into her own hands first.
		캐터리나는 혼자서 먼저
		문제를 처리했지
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:23	I believe you already
		know how that played out.
		그래서 어떻게 됐는지
		자네도 알지
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:27	You cared about her,
		didn't you?
		그녀를 좋아했군요?
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:30	It's a common mistake,
		I'm told.
		많은 사람들이 저지른
		실수라고 들었지
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:35	And it's one
		I won't make again.
		다시는 저지르지 않을거라네
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:40	You don't have to be
		so mad at your brother.
		동생한테 화내지 마
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:43	You know, he's worried
		about Elena, and...
		엘레나 걱정을 해서..
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	[Sighs] Just go, please.
		제발 가줘
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	- I know you're worried
		about her, too. - Andie.
		엘레나도 걱정하는 거 알아
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:50	Go.
		가줘
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:51	Ok.
		좋아
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:58	Tired of your little
		play thing already?
		벌써 인형도 지겨워 진거야?
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	Don't start with me, Stefan.
		시작도 하지 마, 스테판
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:01	She's just my distraction.
		기분 전환용인걸
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:03	[Scoffs] She's a person.
		You're victimizing her.
		앤디도 인간이야
		희생양 삼고 있지
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:06	You should be thankful
		she's here.
		여기 있어
		다행인줄 알아
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	She keeps me from going
		for what I really want.
		내가 정말 원하는 걸
		못하게 만드니까
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:14	You're right.
		맞다
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	Thank you.
		고마워
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	For being in love
		with my girlfriend.
		내 여자친구와
		사랑에 빠져서
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:23	And there it is.
		또 시작이군
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:28	There it is.
		그래
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	You know, you can be in love
		with Elena all you want...
		원하는 만큼 사랑해
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	If it means that
		you'll protect her.
		그렇게 엘레나를
		보호해줄거라면
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:38	But I have the one thing
		that you never will.
		하지만 절대 받지 못할
		한가지가 있지
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	Oh, yeah?
		그래?
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:43	What's that?
		그게 뭔데?
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:47	Her respect.
		그녀의 마음
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:54	[Both grunting and groaning]
		 
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:57	Stop!
		그만해!
00:36:58	 
		 
00:37:05	What have you done?
		무슨 짓을 한거야?
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:08	I don't understand.
		이해가 안 가
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	Katerina has gone.
		She has fled.
		캐터리나가 사라졌어
		도망쳤다구
00:37:12	 
		 
00:37:13	No.
		설마
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:15	What did you tell her?
		I told her nothing.
		- 뭐라고 한거야?
		- 아무 말 안했어
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	Do not lie to me!
		거짓말 하지 마!
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:20	I will find her.
		찾아낼게
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:23	You have my word.
		약속해
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	If you do not,
		못찾아내면
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	I give you my word
		you will be dead.
		맹세컨대
		죽을 줄 알아
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:33	Now you've invited him in?
		그도 초대했어?
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:35	Elijah and I have renewed
		the terms of our deal.
		일라이자와 난
		계약을 갱신했어요
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	Really?
		정말?
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	The two of you will come
		to no harm at my hands.
		자네 둘은 나한테서
		무사할 거네
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:44	I only ask for one
		thing in return.
		그 보답으로 한가지
		부탁하지
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	What?
		뭐죠?
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	An apology.
		사과
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	A what?
		뭐라고요?
00:37:53	 
		 
00:38:03	I'm sorry for the part
		당신을 죽게끔 도운거
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	that I played in your death.
		미안해요
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	I was protecting Elena.
		엘레나를 지키려 했어요
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	I will always
		난 늘
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	protect Elena.
		엘레나를 지킬거죠
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:17	I understand.
		이해하네
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:25	Elena: Sacrifice
		is going to happen, Damon.
		제물의식이 행해질 거에요, 데이먼
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:29	Bonnie will be able to kill
		Klaus without hurting herself
		보니는 다치지 않고
		클라우스를 죽일거에요
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	and Elijah knows
		how to save my life.
		일라이자는
		내 목숨을 살릴 방법을 알구요
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	I told you I'd find another way.
		내가 다른 방법
		찾을거랬죠
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	And I did.
		찾아냈구요
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	- Is that true?
		- It is.
		- 사실이야?
		- 그래
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	And you're trusting him?
		그를 믿어?
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:41	I am.
		네
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	You can all go to hell.
		다들 지옥에나 떨어져
00:38:46	 
		 
00:38:56	He's angry with me right now.
		나한테 화났어
00:38:59	 
		 
00:38:59	But he'll come around.
		돌아올거야
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:02	Perhaps.
		어쩌면
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:12	I thought I told you to leave.
		떠나라고 말한줄로 알았는데
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	You didn't compel me.
		나한테 주문 안 걸었잖아
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:19	I want to be here.
		여기 있고 싶어
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	Just let me be here.
		여기 있게 해줘
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:27	I'm upset.
		나 열 받았어
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:28	And you know what happens
		when I'm upset.
		내가 화났을때
		무슨 일 생기는지 알지
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:32	You have to leave.
		떠나줘
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:34	No.
		싫어
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	You need to know that
		somebody cares about you.
		누군가 당신을
		아낀다는걸 알아줘
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	I care about you, Damon.
		난 당신을 아껴, 데이먼
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:45	[Screaming]
		 
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:50	[Crying]
		 
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:52	[Breathing heavily]
		 
00:39:55	 
		 
00:39:55	[Crying]
		 
00:39:57	 
		 
00:39:59	Hey.
		이봐
00:40:02	 
		 
00:40:04	Hey. Look at me.
		날 봐
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:09	Get out of here,
		before I kill you.
		내가 죽이기 전에
		당장 나가
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	Just go.
		도망치라고
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:16	Go.
		가
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:19	Now!
		당장!
00:40:21	 
		 
00:40:35	[Gasping]
		 
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:42	[Maddox and Greta chanting in latin]
		 
00:40:46	 
		 
00:40:57	[Gasps]
		 
00:41:00	 
		 
00:41:08	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:41:10	 
		 
00:41:10	[Gasps]
		 
00:41:12	 
		 
00:41:33	Now that's more like it.
		바로 이거야
