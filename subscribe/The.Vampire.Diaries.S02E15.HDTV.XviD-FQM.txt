00:00:00	Previously on
		"the vampire diaries..."
		지난 이야기
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	You must be Elena. How
		do we look exactly alike?
		- 엘레나구나
		- 우린 왜 똑같이 생긴거죠?
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	You are a Petrova doppelganger.
		네가 페트로바의
		도플갱어야
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	You're the key to
		breaking the curse.
		저주를 푸는 열쇠지
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	The Sun and the Moon curse?
		태양과 달의 저주요?
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	The curse is
		the real deal.
		클라우스는
		제일 위험한 존재야
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	From the first generation
		of vampires.
		뱀파이어 1세대 중 한명이지
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	The oldest vampire
		in the history of time
		역사상 가장 오래된 뱀파이어가
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	Is coming after me?
		날 쫓고 있다구요?
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	One of the originals.
		1세대 중 한 명이자
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	He's a legend.
		전설이지
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	I'm prepared to
		offer you a deal.
		거래를 제안하려고 하네
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	What kind of a deal?
		어떤 거래요?
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	You and I shall drop out
		자네와 난
		여기서 그만 물러나고
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	And I shall make certain
		your friends remain unharmed.
		난 자네 친구들을
		다치지 않게 지켜주겠네
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	And then what?
		그리고는요?
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	Then I kill him.
		그리고 클라우스를 죽여야지
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	Take me far, far away.
		저 멀리로 데려가줘
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	Where would you
		like to go?
		어디로 가고 싶은데?
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	These must be the other
		Jonathan Gilbert journals.
		조나단 길버트 일기가
		더 있을거야
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	- I come bearing gifts.
		- This is how you kill an Original.
		- 선물 가져왔네
		- 1세대 뱀파이어를 죽이는 도구야
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	That ring Isobel gave you.
		이자벨이 준 반지
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	That's mine.
		I'm gonna want that back.
		주인은 나라네
		곧 돌려받을거야
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	Did he ever tell you
		what happened to his wife?
		아내한테 무슨 일이
		일어났는지 얘기해줬어?
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	What are you saying?
		무슨 소리야?
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	Why don't you ask rick?
		릭한테 직접 물어보지 그래?
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	How will you kill Klaus?
		클라우스는 어떻게 죽이지?
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	After the sacrifice.
		제물 의식 후에
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	After the sacrifice?
		제물 의식 후에?
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	Elena has to die.
		엘레나는 죽어야 해
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:43	You knew that you weren't
		going to survive this?
		살아남지 않을거란걸 안거야?
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	If it comes down to
		the people that I love
		내가 사랑하는 사람들이
		죽느냐 사느냐 문제라면
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	Getting killed or me, I know
		what my choice is going to be.
		내가 어떤 선택을 할지 알아
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	You're being a martyr.
		희생자가 되려는거지
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	That's not heroic.
		It's tragic.
		영웅적인게 아냐
		비극적이지
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:58	With the dying embers of the fire
		펠스 교회를 휩싼
		불길이 꺼져가듯이
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:00	at Fell's church, the scourge
		of the vampires had passed.
		뱀파이어의 무리들도
		사라져갔다
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:05	And though war raged all around us,
		전쟁으로 마을 사람들 모두가
		흥분 상태였지만
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	our town was safe from
		the demons of the night...
		우리 마을은 밤의 괴물로부터
		안전해졌다
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:13	Or so we thought.
		하지만 그것은 착각이었다
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:17	For the monsters we drove
		to their fiery deaths
		불길로 몰아 죽였던 괴물들이
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	had begat new monsters.
		새로운 괴물들을 낳았던 것이다
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:23	Did you hear that?
		방금 들었어요?
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:33	- Stay here.
		- No, Thomas.
		- 여기 있어요
		- 아뇨, 토마스
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	It's all right, dear, the
		vampires are all dead.
		괜찮아요
		뱀파이어는 다 죽었습니다
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	Yes, Honoria... they burned
		in the church. We're safe now.
		오노리아. 뱀파이어들은 교회 안에서
		불타 죽었어요. 우린 안전합니다
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:50	Please, Jonathan.
		I'm worried.
		제발, 조나단
		정말 걱정되요
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:52	Very well. I shall go too.
		알았습니다
		저도 나가보죠
00:01:55	 
		 
00:02:00	I can prove there are no vampires.
		뱀파이어가 없다는걸
		증명해 보이겠소
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:07	See?
		봤죠?
00:02:09	 
		 
00:02:22	Thomas?
		토마스?
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:25	Thomas?
		토마스?
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:33	Thomas!
		토마스!
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:34	No, stay inside! Get
		back in the house!
		들어가 계세요!
		집으로요!
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:36	No!
		안돼!
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:41	I knew I was about to die.
		난 곧 죽게 될 거란 걸 알았다
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:43	You can not run from a vampire.
		뱀파이어로부터
		도망칠 수 없다
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:47	I saw the vampire who killed me.
		날 죽인 뱀파이어를 보았다
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:50	I recognized him.
		바로 누군지 깨달았다
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:52	Stefan Salvatore.
		그것은 바로 스테판 살바토어
00:02:55

00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:23	What's going on?
		무슨 일이야?
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:25	Well, I showered. I shaved.
		샤워하고
		면도했지
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	Had breakfast. Very relaxed.
		아침 먹고
		아주 릴랙스중이야
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	That makes one of us.
		나도 마찬가지야
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	I did hear one piece
		of good news though.
		한가지 좋은 소식을 들었어
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:33	Tyler Lockwood ran away
		from home last night.
		타일러 락우드가
		어젯밤 가출했대
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	How do you know?
		어떻게 알아?
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	Well, I heard it
		from sheriff Forbes,
		포브스 보안관님한테 들었지
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	who heard it from a very
		distraught Carol Lockwood,
		그분은 괴로워하시는
		캐롤 락우드 여사님한테 들었고
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:44	thus, ending our werewolf
		chapter, bringing us to...
		결국에 늑대인간 챕터의 결말은
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	...killing Elijah.
		...일라이자 죽이기로 넘어가지
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	Exactly.
		내 말이
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:50	Well, it's not going to
		be easy. He's crafty.
		쉽지 않을거야
		정말 능란한걸
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	Well, I've got a crafty little dagger.
		나도 능란한 단도가 있는걸
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	He's an Original.
		We don't know what all that encompasses.
		1세대야
		얼마나 강한지 모른다구
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:56	Oh, trust me, Stefan.
		믿어봐
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	I'm gonna dot all my t's.
		I don't want any surprises.
		꼼꼼히 준비할거야
		뒤통수 맞는거 싫다구
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	Wow, Damon, tell me you're actually
		gonna be careful for once.
		형, 이번엔 정말
		조심스럽게 하나 보구나
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	Yes, Stefan, I've become you.
		그래, 스테판
		너처럼 되가고 있지
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	How tragic for both of us.
		참 비극적이지
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	Got to run. I've a murder
		to plan. Busy day.
		가봐야겠다
		살인계획 준비하느라 바빠서
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:20	The old Fell property actually
		starts just beyond that fence.
		펠가의 소유지는
		이 담장 너머부터 시작해요
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	Ah, the Fells... one of
		the Founding Families.
		펠가는..
		개척자 가족 중 하나죠
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	Why do you say it like that?
		왜 그런식으로 말씀하시죠?
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	My research showed me that
		this area was actually settled
		제 조사자료에 의하면
		이 지역은 이미
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	almost two full centuries earlier.
		그들이 오기 2세기 전부터
		정착이 된 상태였어요
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	It was a migration of
		townsfolk from the northeast,
		북동쪽에서 온
		이민자들이었죠
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	um, it was Salem, to be precise.
		정확히 말하면
		세일럼가요
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Massachusetts?
		As in the witch trials?
		매사추세츠요?
		마녀재판이 있던 곳?
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	Which means the ever lauded
		founding families...
		그 뜻은 개척자 가족으로
		추앙받던 분들이
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	They didn't actually found anything.
		사실 아무것도
		발견 못했단 거죠
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	Well, I bet it was the men
		who made a big deal
		1860년대에 자신들이
		개척자라고 우겼던 주인공은
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	about being founders back in 1860.
		남자가 틀림없어요
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	Men are very territorial.
		남자들은 세력권세 습성이 있잖아요
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	Yes, they are.
		그렇죠
00:04:59	 
		 
00:05:01	Elijah, this is my friend,
		Alaric Saltzman.
		일라이자, 제 친구
		알라릭입니다
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	Yeah, I got your message
		about walking Elijah here
		응, 일라이자가
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	through the old property lines.
		이쪽에 들린다고 하길래
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	I thought I would tag along.
		나도 와볼까 싶었어
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	You know being a history buff and all.
		당신이 역사에 대해 잘 아니까
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:15	Where to next?
		다음엔 어디로 가죠?
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	I'm pretty curious about the
		freed slave property owners.
		해방된 노예 소유지 주인이 궁금해요
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	Some say, you know,
		the descendents of the slaves
		어떤 사람들은
		노예의 후손들이야말로
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	are the true keepers
		of American history.
		미국 역사를
		진정으로 간직한 사람들이라면서요
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	Well, I only brought the surveys.
		조사자료가 있는데
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	I got the list in the car
		just give me a sec.
		차 안에 있어요
		조금만 기다려 주세요
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:34	Alaric Saltzman.
		알라릭 살츠만
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:39	So you're one of those people
		당신은 엘레나가
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	on Elena's list
		of loved ones to protect.
		지켜야할 목록에
		포함이 됐더군
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	So is Jenna.
		제나도 마찬가지야
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	You don't have to be jealous.
		질투할 필요 없어
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:47	I don't really pursue younger women.
		난 어린 여자는 별로거든
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:53	It's a joke, Ric, lighten up.
		농담이야
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:55	Right.
		그러셔
00:05:57	 
		 
00:06:05	Hey, whatcha doin'?
		뭐해?
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	Thinking about last night.
		어젯밤 생각하느라
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	Yeah, yeah. Me, too.
		나도 그래
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	It was a tough spell.
		힘든 마법이었어
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	I could feel it draining me.
		I need practice.
		에너지가 고갈되는걸 느꼈어
		연습이 필요해
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Yeah, well, uh, maybe, I don't know.
		그럼 글쎄
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	Maybe you should come over tonight.
		오늘 밤에 우리 집에 올래
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	We can practice.
		Get stronger.
		연습하면서
		더 힘을 키우게
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	Yeah, sure. Thanks.
		그래. 고마워
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:29	Ah, incoming.
		저기 오시네
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:35	You want to tell me what
		the hell happened yesterday?
		어젯밤 대체
		무슨 일이 있었는지 말해줄래?
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	Sorry?
		무슨 말이야?
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	Don't play dumb.
		You both were here and...
		모르는 척 하지마
		너희 둘 다 여기 있었고..
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	And?
		그리고?
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	And that's all I remember.
		그것밖에 기억이 안 나
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:43	One minute I'm playing pool
		당구를 치고 있었는데
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	and the next I'm waking up
		in a bathroom stall.
		깨보니 화장실이었어
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	Sorry, Luka, but everything
		seemed normal yesterday.
		미안해, 루카
		하지만 어젠 모든게 정상이었어
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	I brought you a coffee
		and we played pool.
		난 커피를 가져왔고
		우린 당구를 쳤잖아
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	See, I think you're lying.
		거짓말하는 것 같은데
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	And I think you need to back off.
		이제 물러나지 그래
00:06:57	 
		 
00:07:24	Are you still mad?
		아직 화났어?
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	Yeah, I'm still mad.
		그래
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:29	We had a difference
		of opinion, Stefan,
		의견이 달랐지만
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	we're not always gonna
		agree on everything.
		늘 모든 일에
		동의할 순 없어
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	Elena, you've agreed to
		sacrifice yourself to Klaus.
		엘레나, 넌 클라우스를 위해
		너 자신을 희생하기로 동의했어
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	To say that we have
		a difference of opinion
		의견이 다르다고만 말한다면
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	is the understatement of the century.
		한 세기를
		줄잡아 말한거야
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	You would know.
		너도 알텐데
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:46	What does Jonathan
		Gilbert have to say?
		조나단 길버트는
		뭐라고 적었어?
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:52	A lot.
		많은 것들
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	It's insane the things
		he wrote in his journal
		이상하게도
		일기장에 적은 것들이
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	that he kept from
		the founding families.
		설립자 집안들에
		숨겼던 것들이자
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	Stuff that nobody knows.
		Stuff that...
		아무도 모르는 것이면서...
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	You never told me.
		네가 전혀 말 안했던 것들이야
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:15	We were, uh...
		우린..
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	We were angry at the founding families
		개척자 가족에
		열받아 있었어
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	for what they did to Katherine.
		캐더린한테 했던 짓 때문에
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	We wanted revenge.
		복수를 원했어
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	I didn't know about
		Jonathan Gilbert's ring yet.
		조나단 길버트의 반지에 대해 몰랐어
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:27	I didn't know that he would...
		that he would survive.
		나는 전혀 그가..
		살아남으리라 상상 못했어
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	He describes you as a monster.
		널 괴물로 묘사했던데
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	That's what I was.
		그 때는 그랬지
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:39	I want you to know the truth...
		사실을 알길 원해
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:42	But I want you to hear it from me.
		나한테서 듣기를 원해
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:47	In the weeks after I became a vampire,
		뱀파이어가 되고 몇 주 후에
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	I relished in it.
		피 마시는 것에 빠졌지
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	I took it to
		the darkest place I could.
		가장 어두운 시기였어
00:08:54	 
		 
00:09:00	Who wants to die next?
		다음으론 누가 죽고 싶지?
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	Me, I'm next.
		내 차례에요
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	Me, you promised me.
		나요, 나한테 약속했잖아요
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:07	What about you?
		넌 어때?
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:09	You know if you
		don't pick up the tempo,
		템포를 맞추지 않으면
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	you're going to lose
		your head. Snap. Snap.
		머리를 잃게 될거야
		어서
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:21	Company, brother?
		내가 끼어도 될까?
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:25	I brought enough to share.
		함께 나눠마실 사람은
		충분히 데려왔어
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Are you mad bringing them here
		온 동네가 우릴 쫓고 있는데
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:28	when the entire town is hunting us?
		이 여자들을 여기로
		데려오다니 미쳤어?
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	Damon, if you're worried
		about the founding families,
		데이먼, 설립자 가족들이 걱정되는 거면
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	please don't be. They're
		all dead or about to be.
		그러지 마
		다 죽거나 죽게 될거니까
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:38	Leave this place.
		Never think of it again.
		여길 떠나라
		다신 생각하지 마라
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:40	Same for you.
		Leave this place.
		너도 마찬가지야
		여길 떠나라
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	Never think of it again.
		다시는 생각하지 마라
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	Damon, don't be like this.
		I'm just having some fun.
		데이먼, 그러지 마
		그저 즐기는 뿐인데
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:46	Staying alive is more fun, Stefan.
		살아있는게 더 재미있어, 스테판
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	We have to be more careful than this.
		우리 이것보다 더 조심해야 돼
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	More clever.
		Like Katherine was.
		더 영리하게
		캐더린처럼
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Look what that got her.
		그래서 캐더린이
		어떻게 됐나 봐봐
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:55	I'm done here.
		끝났어
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	With you.
		너랑
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	I'm leaving town.
		여길 떠날거야
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:04	You hate me. I know. I know.
		날 미워하는 구나
		알아
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	An eternity of misery
		and on and on. I know,
		영원히 끝나지 않는 불행과...
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:09	but you don't have to leave town.
		Damon, I'll do better. I promise.
		하지만 떠날 필요 없어
		데이먼, 더 잘할게. 약속해
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	No, you will get us killed.
		아니, 너 때문에
		둘 다 죽겠어
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	I'd rather leave you
		to do that to yourself.
		혼자 그러도록 남겨두지
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:18	I wasn't myself then.
		난 내 자신이 아녔어
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	I was full of guilt.
		What I did to my father,
		죄책감에 차 있었어
		아버지한테 했던 짓과
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	to my brother.
		I had to turn it off.
		형한테 했던 짓 때문에
		방황을 했었지
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	It was the only way I could survive.
		내가 살아남을
		유일한 방법이었으니까
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	It sounds like you were Damon.
		그때는 데이먼 같았구나
00:10:31	 
		 
00:10:34	I was worse.
		더 심했지
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:38	Other than the lecture on
		the history of Mystic Falls,
		미스틱 폴즈의
		역사에 대한 강연보다
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	did you get anything out of Elijah?
		일라이자에 대해 알아낸 거 있나?
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	No, it was boring.
		지루하네
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:46	Of course, Jenna thinks he's charming.
		물론, 제나는 그가 매력적이라지
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	You sounded jealous.
		Sound a bit jealous?
		질투난 것 같은데
		그렇죠?
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	Kinda do.
		맞아요
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	Maybe we shouldn't
		talk about this here.
		여기서 얘기하지 말자
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:56	Andie, she's been compelled
		앤디, 내 비밀은
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	not to divulge
		my secrets. Haven't you?
		누설하지 않도록
		주문을 걸었어요. 맞죠?
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	Uh-huh.
		네
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Mmm. My lips
		are sealed.
		입 꽉 다물거에요
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	This is too weird.
		진짜 이상하다
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	I just need the right opportunity.
		좋은 기회가 필요해
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:11	Ah, there's Jenna
		with her new boyfriend.
		제나와 새 남친이네
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:16	Hi.
		안녕하세요
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	Hey, guys.
		안녕하세요 여러분
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	So I hear you two had quite a meeting
		두분이 역사적인
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	of historical minds today.
		미팅을 하셨다면서요
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	Yeah, I guess you could say that.
		그렇다고 볼 수 있죠
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	Well, as much as I'd
		love to continue this,
		계속 함께하고 싶지만
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	I've got papers to grade.
		채점할 시험지가 있어서
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	No, you know what?
		We should continue this.
		이거 알아요?
		계속 이어가지 그래요
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	Let's have a dinner party.
		오늘 저녁 식사하는거 어때요?
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	Ooh, my girl.
		Full of good ideas.
		내 여자는
		아이디어가 넘친다니까
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	I'll be happy to host.
		제가 주최하죠
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	Say tonight. Maybe?
		오늘밤 어때요
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	It's good for me. Jenna?
		괜찮아요
		제나?
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	I don't know
		if tonight works...
		오늘밤 시간이 될지 모르겠는데..
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	I'm free.
		시간되요
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:46	It'd be a pleasure.
		저야 고맙죠
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:48	Great.
		좋아요
00:11:50	 
		 
00:12:02	Drink up.
		마셔
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	Good girl.
		옳지
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:06	I've come bearing gifts.
		선물 가져왔어
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	I didn't have time to properly shop,
		제대로 쇼핑할 시간이 없었지만
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:11	but I did get a couple
		of things. Hmm?
		몇 개 가져왔어
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:20	Wow, that blood did the trick.
		혈액이 정말 효과가 있네
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:24	You're almost pretty again.
		거의 예전처럼 예뻐졌어
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	What is it you want, Damon?
		원하는게 뭐야?
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Guess who's back in town?
		누가 돌아왔게?
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:31	Your old friend, John Gilbert.
		네 옛 친구, 존 길버트
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	Really. Why?
		정말? 왜?
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	Says he loves his daughter.
		딸을 사랑한데
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	Wants to protect her from
		Elijah and big, bad Klaus.
		일라이자와 클라우스로부터
		그녀를 지키고 싶대
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	Touching.
		감동적이네
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	Yeah, right.
		그렇지
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	He told me this old wives tale
		옛 설화에 대해 얘기해줬어
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	about how to kill an Original.
		1세대를 죽이는 방법을
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	And you want to know if it's true.
		사실인지 알고 싶구나
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	If it was, I wouldn't tell you.
		사실이라면
		너한테 말 안 할거야
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Now, why not? I mean,
		you want Elijah and Klaus
		왜? 그러니까
		일라이자랑 클라우스는
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	dead as much as I do.
		나만큼이나 죽었는 걸
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	Klaus, yes. Elijah, no.
		클라우스는 그렇지만
		일라이자는 아냐
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	He's compelled me to stay in here.
		여기 갇혀있도록
		주문을 걸었다구
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	If he dies, I'm stuck forever.
		그가 죽으면
		난 영원히 여기 갇혀
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	Sucks for you.
		안됐군
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	Forget it, Damon.
		관둬, 데이먼
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	Killing Elijah would be
		a suicide mission.
		일라이자 죽이는 건
		자살 임무나 다름없어
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	You can't do it.
		할 수 없다구
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	- Can so.
		- Can't.
		- 가능한걸
		- 안돼
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Even with a dagger and
		a little white oak ash?
		단도와 떡갈나무 재가 있어도?
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:19	No. Damon, if you kill Elijah,
		안돼, 데이먼
		일라이자를 죽이면
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	then I'm stuck in here forever.
		난 영원히
		여기 갇힌다구
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	You're really scared.
		정말 무서운 모양이구나
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	Just get me out of here first
		우선 날 나가게 해줘
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:29	and then I'll help you.
		그럼 도와줄게
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	I'll... I'll help
		you kill Elijah
		일라이자 죽이는 거나...
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	or... or protect Elena.
		Whatever you want.
		엘레나 지키는 거
		원하는 건 뭐든지
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	I get you out of here and your ass
		널 여기서 나가게 해주면
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	is sipping
		Klaus-free margaritas
		너랑 일라이자는
		클라우스를 피해서
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	on some unknown island
		somewhere. No way.
		이름모를 섬에서
		휴식을 취할텐데. 안돼지
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	That's not true. I'll stay.
		그건 사실이 아냐
		떠나지 않을게
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	Damon, please just don't do it.
		데이먼, 제발 그러지 마
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	Well, thank you, you've told
		me everything I need to know.
		고마워, 알아야 할 모든 걸 알려줬어
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	I've told you nothing.
		아무 것도 말 안했다구
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	You have. You have
		indeed confirmed
		말했는걸
		정말 확인을 해줬어
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	that it is possible
		to kill an Original,
		1세대를 죽이는 게 가능하단 걸
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	which I will do tonight.
		그래서 오늘 죽일거야
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:57	Guess who's coming to dinner?
		누가 저녁식사 하러 오게?
00:13:59	 
		 
00:14:02	For weeks I kept spiraling.
		몇주간 악순환을 겪었지
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	I was completely driven
		by the desire for blood.
		난 피를 향한
		욕망에 사로잡혀 있었어
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:07	Hunt, prey, kill.
		사냥과 약탈과 살인
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	That was all I knew.
		그것만 알았지
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	How come no one caught on
		어째서 아무도
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	to what you were doing?
		네가 하는 짓을 몰랐을까?
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:13	Mmm. There was a war going on.
		전쟁 중이었으니까
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	The thing about wartime.
		전시는 말이야
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:20	Endless, anonymous blood supply.
		끊임없이 낯선이의
		혈액을 공급받을 수 있지
00:14:24	 
		 
00:15:14	Ah!
		 
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	What kind of an idiot are you?
		누구길래 이런
		얼간이 짓을 하는거야?
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:19	Alexia Branson, as she
		was known back then.
		알렉시아 브랜슨
		그 시절 이름이었지
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	Lexi? Your
		best friend Lexi?
		렉시? 네 단짝친구 렉시?
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	That's how you met her?
		그렇게 만난 거야?
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	What was she even doing
		in Mystic Falls?
		미스틱 폴즈에는
		왜 온거래?
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	She had heard it was
		a good place for vampires.
		뱀파이어들이 살기
		좋은 마을이라 들었대
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:34	You know, had no idea that
		they'd all been massacred.
		모두 학살당했으리라는걸 몰랐대
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	Needed a place to crash,
		so I brought her home with me.
		잠시 지낼 곳이 필요해서
		집으로 데려왔지
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:43	I'd say it isn't
		necessary to take me in,
		절 들여줄 필요는 없지만
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:46	but you did try to eat me
		and well, with dawn coming,
		날 먹으려 들은데다
		동틀녘이 다가오는 이상
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	beggars can't be choosers.
		가릴 처지도 아니군요
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:53	Or should they be?
		생각을 다시해야 하나요?
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	I, um...I meant
		to dispose of those.
		처리하려고 했는데
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	My God, you're a ripper.
		살인광이군요
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	A what?
		뭐라구요?
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	There are good parts
		of being a vampire
		뱀파이어는
		선한 면도 있지만
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	and there are bad parts.
		악한 면도 있죠
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	You're the bad parts.
		당신은 악하군요
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:09	Well... we're going
		to have to change that.
		바꿔야겠어요
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:18	You ok?
		괜찮아?
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:23	Talking about her brings up
		things I'd rather forget.
		그녀에 대해 얘기하니
		잊고 싶은 기억들이 떠올라서
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:28	Like Damon killing her?
		데이먼이 죽인 일?
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:36	So what's going on
		with you and Alaric?
		알라릭하고 어떻게 된거에요?
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	I feel like there's some tension.
		뭔가 긴장감이 감도는데
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	I don't know.
		모르겠어요
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	I really like him.
		정말 좋아해요
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	It's more than like
		그러니까
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	and I want it to work,
		잘 되길 원하지만
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	but I can't help but
		feel that he's hiding
		뭔가 숨긴단 느낌이 들어서요
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	something from me.
		And then I've got John
		그리고 존한테
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:58	whispering things in my ear about him.
		뭔가 들은게 있어서요
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	Like what?
		어떤 얘기요?
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	Things I don't want to believe.
		내가 믿고 싶지 않은 거요
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	Things I don't believe,
		내가 믿지 않는 얘기
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	not if they're coming
		from John's mouth.
		존한테서 나온 말이니깐요
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	Oh. Well, there you go, then.
		그게 문제네요
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	Trust is the key to any relationship.
		어떤 관계든
		신뢰가 중요해요
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:11	I mean, I am so grateful that
		Damon tells me everything.
		데이먼이 모든걸 얘기해줘서
		정말 기쁘죠
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:16	This is a bad idea.
		정말 나쁜 아이디어야
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	There's no such thing as a bad idea.
		나쁜 생각 같은 건 존재하지 않아
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Just poorly executed
		awesome ones. Here.
		그냥 실행이 서투른
		엄청 멋진 생각 뿐이지
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	No. I don't like the
		idea of Elijah being
		아니. 난 일라이자가
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:28	in the same house with Jenna.
		제나랑 같은 집에 있다는
		생각 자체가 싫어
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	Jenna's perfectly safe.
		제나는 정말 안전해
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	Besides, it's just
		a fact-finding mission.
		게다가, 이건
		사실을 찾는 임무야
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	It's totally harmless.
		무해하다구
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	Just a fact-finding mission.
		사실 찾는 임무라
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	Yeah.
		그래
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	Listen, no sneak attacks.
		No surprise plans.
		몰래 급습하기나
		깜짝 계획같은건 하지마
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	Nothing that's gonna put
		Jenna in harm's way. Ok?
		제나를 위험하게 만들
		일은 하지 말자고. 알았지?
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	Scout's honor.
		날 믿게
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:46	Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine.
		제나가 와인 때문에
		좀 와달래요
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:52	- Thanks.
		- Yeah.
		고마워요
00:17:54	 
		 
00:18:01	Ok.
		좋아요
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:04	What's that?
		그게 뭐죠?
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	Dessert.
		디저트요
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:09	Hmm.
		 
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:12	Elijah's stronger than me.
		일라이자는
		나보다 강해요
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:15	Faster than me.
		나보다 빠르고요
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	It's all about
		the element of surprise.
		깜짝선물의 요소가 중요하죠
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:18	Ah, it's too bad. I like him.
		He's very old-school. Classy.
		안됐네요, 맘에 드는데
		보수파에 예의 넘쳐요
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	Which is why you should
		encourage the gentlemen
		그래서 신사한테는
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	to take their after dinner
		drinks in here
		여기서 술도 한 잔 하라고
		유도해야 되죠
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	while you do coffee in in
		the kitchen with the girls.
		그 동안 여자들끼리는
		부엌에서 커피 마시면서요
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	Hmm. That is a little
		too sexist for me.
		그건 너무 성차별적인 소리 같은데
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:34	Stop talking.
		얘기 좀 그만해요
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:40	Who invited him?
		누가 초대했죠?
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	John! Surprise... Leave.
		존, 놀랍네.. 나가요
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	When Jenna told me she was
		coming to a dinner party
		제나가 일라이자를 위한
		저녁 식사에 간다고 해서
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	for Elijah, I decided I couldn't
		miss out on all the fun and games.
		재미와 게임를
		놓칠 수 없겠다 싶어서
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	There are not going to
		be any games tonight, John.
		오늘은 아무 게임 안해
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	It's just a friendly
		dinner party.
		그냥 친구끼리 저녁식사지
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:56	What he said.
		맞아
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:59	- Hey.
		- Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	Thanks.
		고마워
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	That thing weighs a ton.
		무겁더라
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	I'm starving.
		You guys have any... food?
		배고파
		집에 뭐.. 없니?
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:09	Oh, God. Heh!
		This is a date.
		이런. 이거 데이트잖아
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	No, no it's not like a date, date.
		아니, 데이트는 아냐
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	More of a hey, I kissed you,
		그것보단
		키스를 했으니
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	and I thought you liked
		it, um... hang thing.
		좋아한 것 같아서
		그냥 어울리는 거지
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	Jeremy, I need to make sure
		Elena is cool with this
		제레미, 난 아무 일 생기기 전에
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	before anything else happens.
		엘레나는 괜찮은지
		확인해야 해
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	I didn't realize my sister had
		approval over who I'm with.
		난 내가 누구랑 사귀든지
		누나 허락이 필요할지 몰랐내
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	She's my best friend,
		I tell her everything.
		내 단짝친구야
		모든걸 말한다구
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	And this whole hang thing
		might freak her out.
		그리고 이렇게 어울리는건
		엘레나가 놀랄 수 있어
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:37	All right, all right, so we'll, um...
		알았어
		그럼..
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	We'll hang out, eat some food,
		어울리면서
		뭐도 좀 먹고
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	work on some spells.
		주문 연구도 하자
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	It's not a big deal.
		별 거 아냐
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:46	But you did...
		You did like it, right?
		하지만.. 누나도 좋았지?
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	Yeah. I liked it.
		그래, 좋았어
00:19:56	 
		 
00:20:00	Good evening.
		안녕하세요
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	Thank you for coming.
		Please, come in.
		와줘서 고맙네
		제발 들어와요
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	Just one moment.
		잠깐만
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	Can I just say that
		if you have anything less
		지금 말해도 될지 모르지만
		만약에 오늘 저녁식사중에
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	than honorable intentions about
		how this evening is going
		뭔가 올바르지 않은 의도가 있다면
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:11	to proceed, I suggest you reconsider.
		다시 생각하길 바라네
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	No, nothing, nothing dishonorable.
		불명예스러운 계획은 없어
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	Just getting to know you.
		그저 더 잘 알려는 의도 뿐이지
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	Hmm. Well, that's good.
		Because, you know,
		그럼 좋아
		왜냐면
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	although Elena and I have this deal,
		엘레나와 거래를 했지만
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	if you so much as make
		a move to cross me,
		나를 거스를 짓을 한다면
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:29	I'll kill you and I'll kill everyone
		in this house. Are we clear?
		자네 뿐 아니라 이 집의
		모든 이를 죽일거야. 알았나?
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:33	Crystal.
		확실히 알아들었네
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:35	Jenna. Wonderful
		to see you again.
		제나. 다시 보게되어 기뻐요
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	How are you?
		잘 지냈어요?
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:39	- Nice to see you.
		- You look incredible.
		정말 아름다우시네요
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:43	I hate to break it to you, Damon,
		데이먼, 말하고 싶지 않지만
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	but according to Elijah,
		일라이자에 의하면
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	your family is so not
		a founder of this town.
		당신 조상은
		이 마을 개척자가 아녜요
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	Hmm, do tell.
		말해봐요
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	Well, as I mentioned to Jenna earlier,
		낮에 제나한테 말했듯이
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	a faction of settlers
		migrated from Salem
		이 마을 개척자는
		세일럼에서 이주했죠
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	after the witch trials in the 1690s.
		1690년 마녀 재판 이후로요
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	Over the next hundred years
		they developed this community
		그 후로 몇백년간
		이 마을을 발전시켰죠
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	where they could feel
		safe from persecution.
		박해로부터 안전하게 말이죠
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	Hmm. Because
		they were witches.
		마녀들이니깐요
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	Yeah, but there's no tangible proof
		네, 하지만 세일럼에
		마녀가 있었다는
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:04	there were witches in Salem.
		실질적인 증거가 없어요
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	Andie's a journalist.
		Big on facts.
		앤디는 기자에요
		사실을 잘 알죠
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	Well, the lore says
		that there was this wave
		민간전승에 의하면
		마녀를 반대하는 운동이
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	of anti-witch hysteria.
		It broke out in the neighboring
		주변 정착지에 발발하면서
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	settlement, so these
		witches were rounded up.
		결국에 이쪽에 모이게 되었다네요
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	They were tied to stakes
		in a field together
		그들은 함께 들판에 묶인채로
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:19	and, uh, burned.
		화형에 처했다네요
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	Some say you could hear the
		screams from miles around us.
		어떤 사람들은 수십만 마일
		떨어진 곳에서 비명소리를 들었답니다
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:24	They were consumed by the
		fire. Could you pass the...
		불속에서 죽은거죠
		실례지만 저것좀?
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:26	I wouldn't repeat this
		to the Historical Society.
		역사학회는 반복하고 싶지 않아요
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:31	It's starting to sound a little
		like a ghost story to me.
		나한텐 귀신얘기같이 들리는데요
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:36	So why do you want to know
		그럼 이런
		대학살 현장에서
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	the location of
		these alleged massacres?
		뭘 알고 싶은거죠?
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:41	You know... a healthy historian's
		curiosity, of course.
		건전한 역사학자의
		궁금증 뿐이죠
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	Of course.
		물론요
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:53	Jonathan Gilbert
		got crazier and crazier.
		조나단 길버트는
		점점 더 미쳐갔어
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	I guess that's what happens when you
		spend your life obsessed with vampires.
		뱀파이어에 집착해 평생을
		살면 저렇게 되나봐
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:08	He researched the Originals.
		1세대를 조사했어
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:12	You're kidding.
		농담이지
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	Later in life, Look.
		후년에 말야. 봐봐
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:14	Pages and pages of
		questions and scribbles.
		질문과 낙서들로 가득찼어
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:22	What's that?
		뭐지?
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:25	"The wood from one tree
		and one tree alone,
		'오직 한가지 나무'
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:28	"an ancient white oak would bring
		death to an Original vampire.
		'오래된 떡갈나무를 사용하면
		1세대 뱀파이어를 죽일 수 있다'
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	When the tree burned,
		all hope was thought lost."
		'나무가 불에 탔을때
		모든 희망이 사라진줄 알았다'
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	He was trying to figure out
		how to kill an Original.
		1세대를 죽일 방법을
		찾아내려 했던 거야
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:43	"But the ash from the tree was saved
		'하지만 나무의 재는 남았고'
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	"and witches forged
		a dagger to which the ash
		'단도를 불려서 재가'
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	could be bonded. This alchemic bond
		provides the necessary poison."
		'붙을 수 있게 하였다. 이런 연금술의
		결합은 필요한 독물질을 제공한다'
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Elena.
		엘레나
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	I wonder if this is true.
		사실인지 궁금해
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:54	I mean, do you think this
		dagger actually exists?
		단도가 실제로
		존재할 것 같아?
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	I know it does...
		있는 거 알아
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	Because John gave it to Damon.
		존이 데이먼한테 줬거든
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:02	John gave Damon the weapon
		존이 데이먼한테
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:05	that's supposed to
		kill Elijah? This one?
		일라이자를 죽일 도구를 줬다구?
		이거를?
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:10	"It must be brandished by
		humans alone, for it will
		'인간이 혼자서
		다뤄야 하며'
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	bring death to all
		demons who wield it."
		'그것을 휘두른 괴물 모두에게
		죽음을 불러일으킬 것이다'
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:16	John's trying to get Damon killed.
		존은 데이먼을 죽이려 한거야
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:21	Does anyone care for some cognac?
		코냑 드실분?
00:23:23	 
		 
00:23:23	I have a bottle
		I've been saving for ages.
		몇년간 아껴둔 코냑이 있거든요
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	None for me thanks.
		Nine bottles of wine is my limit.
		난 됐어
		9병이 한계네
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	Why is your phone off?
		Call me.
		왜 꺼놨어?
		전화줘
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	What's going on, Stefan?
		무슨 일이야, 스테판?
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:33	Damon is planning on killing Elijah.
		데이먼은 일라이자를
		죽일 계획이야
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:37	Tonight.
		오늘 밤에
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:41	The gentlemen should take
		their drinks in the study.
		신사분들은 서재에서 술을 드시죠
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	I have to say the food was almost
		음식은 함께한 분들 만큼이나
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	as wonderful as the company.
		멋졌습니다
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	I like you.
		맘에 들어요
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:53	Here you are, gentleman,
		make yourself useful. Hmm?
		여기요, 신사분
		좀 도와줘요
00:23:56	 
		 
00:23:58	Here, here. Put me to work.
		나도 도와줄게
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:00	Um, I got it.
		내가 할게
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	Hey, Jenna, are you...
		are you ok?
		제나, 괜찮아?
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:05	Yeah, fine, Ric.
		그래, 릭
00:24:06	 
		 
00:24:10	I suspect this is my fault.
		내 잘못이겠지
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:12	What did you do now?
		뭘 한거야?
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	I merely mentioned you haven't
		been completely honest
		난 단지 죽은 아내에 대해
00:24:16	 
		 
00:24:17	with her about your dead wife.
		솔직하지 못했다고
		언급한 것 뿐이네
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:18	You son of bitch.
		이 나쁜 자식
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:21	I think I've been very
		clear with you, Ric.
		난 확실히 말했네
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:23	I want my ring back.
		반지 돌려받고 싶다고
00:24:25	 
		 
00:24:29	Hello. Slow down.
		Slow down.
		여보세요
		진정해봐
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	So, let me guess. In
		addition to the moonstone,
		맞춰보자
		월장석에다가
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	the doppelganger, the lion,
		도플갱어와
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:39	the witch and the wardrobe,
		사자와 마녀와 옷장
		(나니아 연대기를 이용한 농담)
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:41	you need to find
		this witch burial ground.
		마녀를 묻을 땅이 필요하군
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	Because I feel as though
		we've grown so close, Damon,
		우리 사이가
		가까워진 것 같으니
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:46	I'll tell you yes.
		맞다고 해두지
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:50	Do you know where it is?
		어디있는지 아나?
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:51	Maybe.
		어쩌면
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:56	Tell me why it's so important.
		중요한 이유를 말해봐
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	We're not that close.
		우린 그리 가깝지 않아
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:01	It's quite a collection you have here.
		여기 참 많이도 모았군
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	Hmm.
		그래
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	It's a funny thing about books.
		책이란 참 웃기지
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	Before they existed, people
		actually had memories.
		책이 존재하기 전엔
		사람들이 기억을 잘 했거든
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	Uh!
		 
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:15	Gentlemen, we forgot about dessert.
		신사분들
		디저트를 잊었네요
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:21	Elijah?
		일라이자?
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	Miss Star...
		스타양..
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:42	 
		'단도를 휘두르면
		자넨 죽게 될거야'
00:25:43	??
		'단도를 휘두르면
		자넨 죽게 될거야'
00:25:45	??
		 
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:50	Sorry, guys, dessert is
		taking longer than I thought.
		죄송해요, 디저트는
		내 생각보다 오래 걸렸어요
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:53	I usually just unwrap food.
		난 그저 사온 음식을
		풀기만 했었거든요
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:59	So... I know this
		is a social thing,
		사교적 모임인 거 아는데
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	but I... I would really love
		to ask you some more questions
		전.. 몇가지
		질문을 하고 싶어요
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	about the work that you're doing here.
		여기서 하시는 일에 대해서요
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	I'd love to answer.
		기꺼이 답하죠
00:26:08	 
		 
00:26:08	Great. Oh, that's so great.
		좋아요. 잘됐네요
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:10	Ric, would you do me a favor and
		grab the notebook out of my bag?
		릭, 내 부탁 좀 들어줄래요
		가방에서 노트 좀 가져다줄래요?
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	Elijah, did John tell you
		he's Elena's uncle/father?
		일라이자, 존이 엘레나 삼촌이자
		아빠란거 들었어?
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	Yes, I'm well aware of that.
		잘 알고 있지
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	Of course, she hates him,
		so there's absolutely no need
		물론, 엘레나는 존을 혐오하니
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	to keep him on the
		endangered species list.
		위험에 빠진 종 목록에
		포함시킬 필요 없잖아
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:24	Ric, it's in the front pocket.
		릭, 앞주머니에 있어요
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	On the... you know what?
		Excuse me, guys. Sorry.
		이거 알아요?
		죄송해요
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	What I'd like to know, Elijah,
		내가 알고 싶은건
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:31	is how do you intend on killing Klaus?
		어떻게 클라우스를 죽일 계획인지야
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	Gentlemen, there's a few things
		신사분들
		지금 확실히할
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	we should probably
		get clear right now.
		사항이 있네
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:37	I allow you to live solely
		to keep on eye on Elena.
		난 엘라나를 감시하기 위해
		자네를 살려둔거야
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:41	I allow Elena to remain in her house
		엘레나가 집에 남아서
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	living her life with
		her friends as she does
		친구와 함께
		살 수 있도록
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:46	as a courtesy. If you
		become a liability,
		호의를 베풀었네
		잘못을 저지른다면
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	I'll take her away from you and
		you'll never see her again.
		엘레나를 떼어서
		절대 못보게 할거야
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:50	Ok. My first question is when
		you got here to Mystic...
		제 첫 질문은
		마을에 처음 왔을 때..
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	Aah!
		 
00:26:59	 
		 
00:27:20	Now, get rid of him before
		Jenna comes back with dessert.
		제나가 디저트 먹으러
		돌아오기 전에 처리해
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	All right.
		좋아
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:34	Elena, we need to talk about this.
		엘레나, 얘기 좀 하자
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	What good is talking if you and
		Damon are just gonna lie to me?
		둘이 거짓말을 할거면
		뭐하러 얘기를 해?
00:27:40	 
		 
00:27:41	If you don't like
		my decisions, that's fine.
		내 결정이 맘에 안 들면 괜찮아
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:43	There's nothing I can do about that,
		내가 어쩔 수 없으니까
00:27:45	 
		 
00:27:45	but if you ever go
		behind my back again, I'll...
		하지만 또
		나 몰래 일을 꾸민다면
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	you're gonna what? Hmm?
		What are you gonna do, Elena?
		이거 알아?
		넌 어쩔건데?
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	It's my life.
		Yeah, exactly.
		- 내 인생이야
		- 그러니까
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	It's your life and I'm
		gonna do everything
		네 인생이고
		나는 네가 살도록
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	I can to make sure that you live it.
		뭐든지 다 할거야
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:54	Then what? This... this...
		this trip through the past.
		그리곤? 이건..
		이 과거로의 여행
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:57	You being honest.
		Was there any truth to that
		진실한 모습 말이지
		정말 사실인 거야
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:59	or were you just distracting me?
		아니면 정신을
		딴데로 돌리려는 거야?
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	I was telling you about a time
		난 모든걸 잃은 줄 알았던
00:28:01	 
		 
00:28:01	when I thought everything was lost.
		시절에 대해 얘기하는 거야
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	When I had given up because
		내가 다 포기했을 때를
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	that's exactly what
		you're doing right now.
		왜나면 너도 바로
		지금 그러고 있거든
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:05	That is not what...
		그건 내가..
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	Yes, it is! Even if you don't
		want to admit it.
		맞는걸! 넌 인정도 안해
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	You are giving up...
		and Lexi?
		포기하고 있다구
		렉시는?
00:28:10	 
		 
00:28:10	she wouldn't let me give up.
		포기하지 못하게 막았어
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:11	I'm not gonna let you.
		이번엔 내가 그렇게 두지 않을거야
00:28:14	 
		 
00:28:17	All of these men are dead or dying.
		이 사람들은
		죽거나 죽어가죠
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:21	What does that make you feel?
		저들을 보니 기분이 어때요?
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	Nothing.
		I feel nothing.
		아무 느낌 안납니다
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:25	Because you shut out the part
		of you that was human.
		인간의 일부를
		막으려고 하니까요
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	The part that lets you feel.
		감정을 말이죠
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:29	Is that not the point?
		그래야 되는게 아닌가요?
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:30	Well, there is a better way.
		You simply have to want it.
		더 좋은 방법이 있어요
		원하면 되죠
00:28:32	 
		 
00:28:33	Is it better?
		감정을 느끼는게 더 좋나요?
00:28:35	 
		 
00:28:35	Not at first. You can't
		choose what you feel.
		처음엔 아니죠
		느끼고 싶은걸 선택할 수 없어요
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:38	You have to let it all back in.
		모든걸 다 받아들여야 해요
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	The pain and the look in their eyes
		생명을 앗아갈 때
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:43	when you took their life.
		The cries of their loved ones.
		저들의 고통과 눈빛
		저들을 사랑하는 이들의 울음
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	Why would I want
		to do that? Hmm?
		왜 그래야 하죠?
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	Because once you
		can hurt, you can love.
		상처를 받을줄 알아야
		사랑할 수 있으니까요
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:51	Love, Stefan.
		사랑요, 스테판
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:53	That's the point.
		그게 중요하죠
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:56	Everything is intensified
		when you're a vampire.
		뱀파이어가 되면
		모든게 극대화되죠
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	When we hurt, we really hurt.
		상처를 받으면
		정말 아파요
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:06	But when we love...
		하지만 사랑을 하면..
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:13	Lexi showed me that
		there was another way.
		렉시는 다른 방법이
		있다는 걸 보여줬어
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	And from that day forward,
		I started fighting for it.
		그 후로
		맞서싸우기 시작했지
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:22	For my own survival.
		스스로 살아남기 위해서
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:29	That's all I want you to do.
		너도 그랬으면 좋겠어
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:31	I just want you to fight for it.
		맞서 싸우길 바란다구
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:52	Now, you said there wasn't
		going to be any violence.
		폭력적인 일은 없을 거라며
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	Says the guy that did all the killing.
		다 죽인 사람이 말하시네요
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	Hey, I took the shot
		because I saw an opening,
		좋은 기회가 생겨서
		시도했던 거야
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	not because I planned
		to do this with Jenna
		제나가 있는 집에서 하려는
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	in the house.
		Now, you can't lie to me like that.
		- 계획 같은건 없었다구
		- 그런 거짓말 마
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	Hey, I am your friend, damn it.
		난 네 친구야
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:05	And you don't have any friends.
		다른 친구들 없잖나
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	So, no more lying.
		이젠 거짓말 말게
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:24	Elijah's dead.
		일라이자는 죽었어
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:28	Alaric did it.
		알라릭이
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:37	Originals believed in truth and honor.
		1세대는 사실과 명예를 믿었어
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:39	It was forbidden for a vampire
		to kill another vampire.
		뱀파이어가 다른 뱀파이어를
		죽이는 건 금기시됐어
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	So, the dagger would take both lives.
		그러니 단도는
		둘 모두의 삶을 앗아가지
00:30:47	 
		 
00:30:47	And as long as the dagger
		stays in place,
		단도가 제 자리에 있는 한
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	the Original, for all intents
		and purposes, is dead.
		1세대는 완벽히 죽는거지
00:30:54	 
		 
00:31:05	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	I need you to find Elena.
		엘레나를 찾아
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	Now.
		당장
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:25	Ah... now, that is cool.
		How does it work?
		좋았어
		어떻게 하는 거야?
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	It's called channeling.
		힘을 통하는 거야
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:31	Siphoning power
		from something...
		무언가로부터 파워를 흡수해서
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	another witch...
		the Moon, an element.
		다른 마녀나
		달이나 어떤 원소로
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	So, technically, you could channel me.
		그럼 말 그대로
		나도 통할 수 있겠네
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	What?
		뭐라고?
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Well, I'm an element, sort of.
		난 일종의 원소잖아
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:40	I mean, isn't... isn't
		the human body mostly water?
		그러니까 인간의 신체는
		대부분 물이 아니던가?
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:44	You're right.
		맞아
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:47	Let's... see what happens.
		어떻게 될지.. 보자
00:31:50	 
		 
00:32:06	What the hell are you doing here?
		대체 여긴 무슨 일이죠?
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:09	Jeremy!
		제레미!
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	What did my son tell you?
		내 아들이 뭐라고 했지?
00:32:12	 
		 
00:32:12	What did he tell you?
		무슨 얘기를 했냐고?
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	He told me about your daughter.
		당신 딸에 대해 얘기해줬어요
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:16	I know Klaus has her and I
		want to help you get her back.
		클라우스가 데리고 있으니
		되찾는데 돕고 싶어요
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	But I want us to work together.
		같이 힘을 합쳐요
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	Please.
		제발
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:23	This is for your own good.
		널 위한거다
00:32:26	 
		 
00:32:27	No! No.
		안 돼요!
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	No!
		안 돼!
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:41	If any harm comes to my son
		네가 한 일 때문에
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	because of what you did,
		you will answer to me.
		내 아들이 위험에 쳐하면
		내가 찾아올거네
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:56	You ok?
		괜찮아?
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:59	It's ok.
		응
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:02	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:05	He took my powers.
		내 힘을 빼앗아갔어
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:34	He's here.
		그가 여기 있어
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:49	You have to go. I need
		to talk to him alone.
		넌 가봐
		내가 혼자 얘기할게
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:52	- Elena.
		- Stefan, I'm ok.
		- 엘레나
		- 스테판, 괜찮아
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	He can't come in the house.
		집에 들어올 수 없다구
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	You know, I might not be
		able to enter this house...
		집에 들어갈 수 없을지는 몰라도..
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:59	But I'm a very patient man.
		난 아주 인내심이 강하네
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	I'll wait you out.
		밖에서 기다리지
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:21	They shouldn't have
		done what they did.
		그런 짓은 할 필요 없었는데
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:23	The deal is off.
		거래는 끝났네
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	I'm renegotiating.
		재협상을 하죠
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	You have nothing left
		to negotiate with.
		이제 협상할 게
		아무것도 남지 않았어
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:38	I'd like to see you lure
		Klaus into Mystic Falls
		미스틱 폴즈로
		클라우스를 유인해줘요
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	after the doppelganger
		bleeds to death.
		도플갱어가 제물로
		죽은 후에 말이죠
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:43	Stefan won't let you die.
		스테판은 네가 죽는걸
		가만두지 않을거야
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:45	No, he won't.
		그래요
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	He'll feed me his blood to heal me,
		날 회복시키려
		피를 먹일거고
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:49	and then I'll kill myself
		and become a vampire,
		그럼 난 죽어서
		뱀파이어가 되는거죠
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	just like Catherine did.
		캐더린이 그랬듯이요
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:54	So unless you want
		that to happen again,
		그런 일이 생기길 원치 않는다면
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:56	promise me the same
		as before... promise me...
		전처럼 약속해줘요
		나한테
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:00	You won't harm anyone that I love.
		내가 사랑하는 누구든
		해치지 않겠다구요
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	Even if they've harmed you.
		그들이 자넬
		죽여도 말인가
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:11	I'm sorry, Elena.
		미안, 엘레나
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:17	I'm going to have to call your bluff.
		자넬 못 믿겠네
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:33	Uhh!
		 
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:34	No!
		안돼!
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:43	Yes. Yes, you can
		have your deal.
		그래. 거래를 다시 하지
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	Let me heal you.
		내가 치유하게 해주게!
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	Give me your word!
		맹세해줘요
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:49	I give you my word.
		맹세하지
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:52	Uhh!
		 
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	Uhh.
		 
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	Uhh!
		 
00:35:57	 
		 
00:36:16	Little tip. Don't
		pull the dagger out.
		팁 하나 줄게
		단도 빼지 마
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:30	Where did John disappear to?
		존은 어디로 사라진거야?
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:34	Maybe the same place the rest
		of the dinner party ran off to.
		저녁 식사 손님들이
		도망친 데로 갔겠지
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	Look, Jenna, I'm, uh...
		제나, 있지..
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	I'm so sorry
		tonight was...
		오늘 밤 미안해..
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	what happened to Isobel?
		이자벨한테
		무슨 일이 있던거야?
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:45	You know, John should have
		never brought that up.
		존은 그 얘길
		꺼내선 안됐는데
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:47	That's not an answer.
		답은 그게 아니잖아
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:49	He's just trying to stir up trouble.
		문제를 일으키려던 것 뿐였어
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	That's not an answer, either.
		그것도 내가 원하는 답이 아냐
00:36:52	 
		 
00:36:52	I can't talk about this, Jenna.
		말해줄 수 없어
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	I keep thinking that maybe it's me.
		계속 나만 그런건가
		생각했어
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	Maybe I'm reading into things.
		내가 너무
		해석하는건지 모르지만
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:58	I should trust you.
		당신을 믿어야 해
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:00	That's what a relationship
		is about, right?
		사람 관계란 믿음이 중요하잖아?
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	But then I think that
		maybe John is right
		하지만 존이 맞았던 것 같아
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:06	and maybe you're not
		being honest with me.
		당신이 나한테
		솔직하지 않은 것 같아
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:09	So... are you being honest?
		나한테.. 숨기는 거 없지?
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:21	Hmm.
		 
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:24	Right, ok.
		좋아
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:32	...that was an answer.
		...답 잘 들었어
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:41	Well, that was awkward.
		곤란한데
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:50	You know, I can clear
		all this stuff up
		원한다면 내일
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	about Isobel tomorrow, if you want.
		이자벨에 대한 얘기를
		정리해주지
00:37:56	 
		 
00:37:56	Or not.
		싫으면 말고
00:37:58	 
		 
00:38:09	You want it?
		이걸 원해?
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	Take it.
		가져가
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:12	It's yours.
		당신 꺼니까
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:13	And after what you did to Damon...
		데이먼한테 했던 일은..
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:18	You're gonna need it more than me.
		나보다 더
		이 반지가 필요할 테니까
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:33	Uhh!
		 
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	What do we have here?
		이게 누구신가?
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	A little moonstone bar of soap.
		월장석 비누네
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	I'll hold on to this.
		내가 갖고 있지
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	So, that's it.
		끝이야?
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:44	I mean, as long as we keep the dagger
		단도를 박아놓은 이상
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	in there, then he stays dead.
		죽어 있을 거야
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	Pretty much.
		그렇지
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:51	Ok, then...
		Good night.
		그럼, 잘 자
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:56	You know, you guys want me
		to fight, fine, I'll fight.
		맞서 싸우길 바란다면
		싸울게요
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	But if we're gonna do this,
		이렇게 할거면
00:39:02	 
		 
00:39:03	you can't keep anything
		from me anymore.
		나한테 숨기는 게 없어야 해요
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:05	From this moment on,
		we're doing it my way.
		이제부터는
		내 식대로 할거에요
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:11	That seems fair.
		좋아
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:16	Ok.
		알았어
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:18	Ok.
		좋아
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:23	Seems like she's had
		a change of attitude.
		태도가 바뀐 모양이군
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:25	How did you get through to her?
		어떻게 설득시킨 거야?
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	I told her a little story
		옛 이야기를 꺼냈어
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	about when I was making
		the wrong decisions
		내가 잘못된 선택을 저지를 
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:33	and somebody showed me
		there was a better way.
		누군가 더 좋은 방법을
		보여줬거든
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:36	Lexi?
		렉시?
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:38	Yeah.
		그래
00:39:39	 
		 
00:39:40	You remember her?
		기억나?
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:57	Going somewhere?
		어디 가요?
00:39:59	 
		 
00:40:03	You must be the vampire I hear
		my brother complaining about.
		내 동생이 불평하던
		그 뱀파이어군요
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	That would be me.
		나 맞아요
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:07	And you must be
		the brother who hates him.
		당신은 그를 싫어하는 형이군요
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:14	We are at irreparable odds.
		만회하기 힘든 불화가 있었죠
00:40:17	 
		 
00:40:17	You know the hate you're
		feeling towards Stefan?
		스테판한테 느끼는 증오 말이죠
00:40:20	 
		 
00:40:20	Towards everyone?
		모든 이들한테 가진 증오도
00:40:21	 
		 
00:40:21	You think you have it under
		control but you don't.
		모든걸 통제한다 생각치만
		사실이 아녜요
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:25	It will get the best of you.
		그런 증오가 당신을
		침식시킬거에요
00:40:27	 
		 
00:40:32	Help him.
		스테판을 도와줘요
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:35	He needs it.
		필요하니까요
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:38	I'll help him.
		알았어요
00:40:40	 
		 
00:40:47	Andie?
		앤디?
00:40:49	 
		 
00:40:49	I thought you left.
		간 줄 알았어요
00:40:51	 
		 
00:41:02	Hello, Damon.
		안녕, 데이먼
00:41:04	 
		 
00:41:05	Hey, do you have a robe?
		타올 있어?
00:41:08	 
		 
00:41:12	How did you get out?
		어떻게 나온 거야?
00:41:13	 
		 
00:41:13	I knew that if I begged
		you not to kill Elijah,
		일라이자를 죽이지 말라고 빌면
00:41:18	 
		 
00:41:18	that's exactly what you'd do.
		죽일 줄 알았어
00:41:19	 
		 
00:41:19	Little known fact... Originals
		can compel vampires.
		잘 안 알려진 사실. 1세대는
		뱀파이어에게 주문을 걸 수 있지
00:41:23	 
		 
00:41:23	But as soon as they die,
		the compulsion wears off.
		하지만 죽으면
		주문도 사라져
00:41:28	 
		 
00:41:28	And you knew?
		알겠어?
00:41:30	 
		 
00:41:30	And I'm still here.
		근데도 난 아직 여기 있지
00:41:32	 
		 
00:41:32	I didn't run.
		도망치지 않았어
00:41:34	 
		 
00:41:34	I meant what I said to him, Damon.
		내가 했던 말 진심이야
00:41:36	 
		 
00:41:36	I'm going to help you.
		널 도울거야
00:41:39	 
		 
00:41:42	So...
		그럼..
00:41:45	 
		 
00:41:45	How about that robe?
		타올은?
00:41:47
