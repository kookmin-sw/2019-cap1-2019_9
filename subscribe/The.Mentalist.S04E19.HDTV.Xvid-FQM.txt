00:00:01	Just think--
		생각을 해 봐 
00:00:03	 
		 
00:00:03	this was once the seabed
		of a prehistoric ocean.
		여긴 한때 원시 바다의 해저였다구
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	So?
		그래서? 
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	So it lends perspective
		in the great scheme of things,
		세상의 이치를 꿰뚫어 볼 지혜를 빌려주지 
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	just how insignificant,
		how small, how tiny we are.
		우리가 얼마나 덧없고 사소한
		존재인지를 
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	- Maybe for you. Tiny
		- Cho. What do we got?
		넌 그런지 몰라도 난 아니야.
		조, 밝혀진 게 뭐야?
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	License and registration
		I.D. him as a Ryan D'Stefano.
		운전면허증에 따르면 이름은
		라이언 스테파노입니다 
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Wallet was on him.
		No money gone.
		지갑도 소지했고 돈도 그냥 있습니다 
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	Keys in the ignition.
		Gas tank was empty.
		차 키는 꽃혀 있고 연료통은 비었습니다 
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	How'd he die?
		사인은? 
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	Shot from behind
		at close range.
		근접거리에서 등에 총을 맞았습니다 
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Road rage, or paid hit?
		도로에서 시비가 붙은건가, 
		살인청부인가? 
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:40	There's two sodas
		in the drink holder.
		앞좌석에 음료수컵 두개가 있는데 
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	One's diet.
		The other's regular.
		하나는 다이어트용 하나는 일반이야 
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	Body's on
		the passenger side,
		시체는 조수석 쪽에 있으니 
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	so one can assume there were
		two people in the car.
		차에는 두 사람이 타고 있었다고
		생각할 수 있겠지 
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:51	Where'd the other one go?
		나머지 한 사람은 어디로 갔지? 
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:52	That's a good question.
		좋은 질문 
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:53	Anything else useful?
		다른 쓸만한 건? 
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	No, we're still
		running down the name.
		아직 이름으로 조회중입니다 
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	Found this in his pocket.
		이걸 주머니에서 찾았어요 
00:00:58	 
		 
00:00:58	It's a start.
		여기서 시작해야겠네 
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:02	Hmm.
		 
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:09	Yeah, I know Ryan D'Stefano.
		라이언 스테파노라면 압니다
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:12	He worked here for about,
		I don't know, six weeks.
		6주 정도인가 여기서 일했죠 
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	He doesn't work
		for you anymore?
		그만 뒀습니까? 
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	Not for the last six months.
		6개월 전에 그만뒀어요 
00:01:17	 
		 
00:01:17	What kind of work was he doing
		for you, Mr. Holmes?
		무슨 일을 했습니까, 홈즈씨? 
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:20	Security guard. I run security
		here at the casino.
		보안이요. 제가 여기 보안 담당자입니다 
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	Mr. D'Stefano
		is a convicted criminal.
		스테파노씨는 전과자였습니다 
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:26	He's served time
		for burglary and armed robbery.
		절도와 무장 강도 혐의로 복역했어요 
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	You hire ex-cons to work
		for security for you often?
		전과자를 경비로 자주 채용합니까? 
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	No, I don't,
		and that's why I fired him.
		아니요. 실은 그래서 해고한 겁니다 
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	How'd he get past
		the background check?
		신원조회를 어떻게 통과했죠? 
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	Look, I can't access
		police records as fast as you.
		난 경찰이 아니니 그런 정보를
		늦게 알 수 밖에요 
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	Once I found out,
		I dealt with it.
		하지만 알자마자 조처를 취했죠
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	Yes, you seem like a man
		that deals with things.
		빈틈없는 해결사 타입으로 
		보이십니다 
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	You got that right.
		당신 말이 맞소 
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:45	Did Mr. D'Stefano
		form any relationships
		스테파노가 여기서 일하면서 
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:47	while he was working here?
		Friends or enemies?
		친구라던가 적을 만들지는 않았나요? 
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	No, he kept pretty much
		to himself.
		아니오, 거의 혼자서 지냈습니다 
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:52	Can you think of anybody
		스테파노씨를 해칠 동기가 
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	who may have wanted
		to harm Mr. D'Stefano?
		있을만한 사람은 없습니까? 
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	No.
		없습니다 
00:01:56	 
		 
00:01:56	We need to talk to your boss.
		Where is he?
		그쪽 사장님이랑 말씀 나누고 싶은데
		어디 계시죠? 
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	That would be Mr. Shaw.
		He's not here today.
		쇼씨는 오늘 여기 안 계십니다 
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:02	What about any kind of paperwork
		you might have on D'Stefano?
		스테파노씨에 대한 문서기록은요?
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	Where's that?
		그것들은 어딨습니까?
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:04	This way.
		이쪽으로 오시죠 
00:02:06	 
		 
00:02:07	Where's the other guy?
		같이 오던 한 사람은? 
00:02:09	 
		 
00:02:09	Ah. He does that.
		He'll be back later.
		원래 그래요. 이따 나타날 겁니다 
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	This way.
		따라오시죠 
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	The handcuffs are no longer
		on me. They are on you.
		수갑은 이제 내가 아닌 이 분이 
		차고 계십니다 
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:21	 
		 
00:02:24	And here's your watch,
		good as new.
		그리고 여기 새것같은
		시계를 받아가시죠 
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:25	Ohh.
		 
00:02:27	 
		 
00:02:27	A round of applause
		for our volunteer.
		자원자께 큰 박수 부탁드립니다

00:02:36	In the Lamaseries
		of the Orient--
		동방의 밀교 사원에서.... 
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	Hey, Jack,
		where's my 50 bucks?
		여어, 잭! 내 50달러 돌려줘! 
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:45	From the Lamaseries

		동방의 밀교 사원에서 
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	to the ancient texts...
		아틀란티스의 
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	of Atlantis...
		고대 문서까지를 종횡무진하며
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:51	I have found the key to
		controlling the dark energies...
		저는 우주의 신비한 어둠의 힘을
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54

00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	 
		 
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:01	Channeling these energies...
		그 힘을 이용해 
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	I will transport
		my beautiful assistant
		제 아름다운 조수를 
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	across the stage...
		무대에서 이 상자 속으로 
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	to reappear in this box.
		이동시켜 보겠습니다 
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	Seriously, Jack.
		I just want what's mine.
		농담 아니라고, 잭. 내 돈 달란 말이야 
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:14	Where's my 50 bucks?
		내 50달러 어디 있냐고? 
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	50 bucks, or I'll blow the trick.
		내 50달러!
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:26	Lowlife piker!
		I want my scratch!
		삼류 구두쇠 악한 같으니!
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	Or I'll tell 'em about the trapdoor.
		내 돈 떼어먹은 놈!
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:34	Hey, Jack, calm down.
		Don't recognize me?
		잭, 진정해. 나 못 알아보겠어? 
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	Patrick Jane?
		I should have known.
		패트릭 제인? 네놈인줄 알았어야 했는데 
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	Little heckling,
		and you blow a simple pass.
		야유 좀 한 것 갖고 정색하기는 
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	You're losing your touch,
		Jack.
		솜씨가 예전만 못한데, 잭 
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:45	Oh!
		우욱!
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	You ruined my act.
		내 쇼를 망치다니 
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:48	 
		하지만 다시 만나 반갑군 
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51

		♪ The Mentalist 4x19 ♪
		Pink Champagne on Ice
00:03:58	 
		 
00:04:03	Yeah, I'm doing pretty good
		here all around.
		여기 대우도 꽤 나쁘지 않아 
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:05	This job's just temporary,
		really,
		물론 여기 일은 잠깐 해주는 거지만 
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	until the new floor show
		at Caesars.
		시저스 호텔에서 쇼를 맡기 전까지만
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:09	That's next... probably.
		아마 그게 다음 스케줄이...될거야 
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	Oh, that's great.
		그거 잘됐네 
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:13	Yeah. I'm excited.
		I am super excited.
		나도 이만저만 기대되는게 아냐 
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:18	What happened, Jack?
		그 사이 무슨 일이 있었어? 
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:22	You were headed for the top.
		성공가도를 달리고 있었잖아 
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	I still am.
		지금도 마찬가지야 
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:27	I still am--I still am.
		난 지금도 최고라고 
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:30	I just, uh...
		그저 난... 
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:34	I got sidetracked.
		I got caught up in some stuff.
		잠깐 옆길로 샜어, 경찰 신세를 졌거든 
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:42	I got busted for drugs.
		I did some time.
		마약 단속에 걸렸어. 잠깐 약을 하기도 했고 
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	It's not a big deal.
		Just, uh...
		뭐 그리 대단한 건 아니야 
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	Just messed with my bookings
		a little, so...
		그러다보니 계약에 불성실해지고 해서...
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	That's showbiz. Right?
		그런게 쇼비즈니스지, 안 그래? 
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	But I'm working my way
		back up, so...
		하지만 재기하려고 노력하고 있어 
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	Blah blah blah, that's me.
		What you been up to, Patrick?
		뭐 내 처지는 그렇고 그래. 
		넌 그동안 어떻게 지냈어? 
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:03	I work with the police.
		나 경찰이랑 일해 
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:07	CBI.
		CBI
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	I'm investigating a murder.
		지금 살인사건 수사 중이야 
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	You're kidding me.
		농담이지 
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	No. No.
		아냐, 진짜야 
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	In fact, uh...
		실은... 
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	This is my bit. Uh...
		바로 이 남자인데, 
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	Do you recognize this man?
		얼굴 알아 보겠어? 
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:22	No, never seen him.
		한번도 본 적 없는데 
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	Seriously.
		진짜로?
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:28	N--y--no, no.
		으음, 역시 아니야 
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:31	How are you, of all people,
		working with the cops?
		도대체 너 같은 녀석이 어쩌다
		경찰하고 일하는거냐?
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	You didn't hear
		what happened?
		무슨 일 있었는지 못 들었어? 
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	No. Hear what?
		아니, 뭘 들어? 
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	Eh, it's a long story.
		에, 얘기가 길어져 
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:42	I'm here.
		아무튼 난 요새 이래 
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:45	Well, I'm sorry I can't be
		of more assistance, Officer.
		도움이 되어드리지 못해 죄송합니다, 
		경찰 나으리 
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:50	Good to see you so well,
		Jack.
		잘 지내는 것 같아서 기뻐, 잭 
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	Last time I saw you
		was 16 years ago,
		마지막으로 본게 16년 전이었지 
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	when you opened for me
		in Kansas City,
		캔자스에서 일할 수 있게 도와줬잖아 
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	and for what it's worth,
		you don't look a day older.
		그리고 이건 그냥 내 생각이지만,
		넌 그때랑 비교해 하나도 안 늙었다 
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	Well, thank you,
		but you're mistaken, Patrick.
		흐음, 고마워. 하지만 정정할게 있군 
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	It's you who opened for me.
		캔자스 지역을 소개해준건 너였어 
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	Your memory's going.
		기억력이 갔구만 
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	Mm. Mentalists.
		멘탈리스트들이란
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	@@/Big talkers.@@\ No skills.
		허풍만 셌지 실제 할줄 아는건 없지 
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:16	See you.
		또 봐 
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:22	Ballistics reports
		the slugs came from a .38.
		탄도 분석 결과 쓰인 총은 38구경입니다 
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	Explains why there were no shell
		casings at the crime scene.
		탄피가 발견되지 않은 이유가 설명되죠 
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	We got D'Stefano's prints
		all over the car
		스테파노 지문이 차 안 곳곳과 
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	and on one of the soda cups.
		음료수 컵 하나에서 발견됐습니다 
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	There's different prints
		on the other cup.
		두번째 지문이 다른 컵에서 나왔구요 
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	Haven't come up with anything
		yet, but we're still searching.
		아직 조회된 건 없지만 계속 찾고 있습니다 
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	If they're in the system,
		we'll find 'em.
		시스템 상에 있다면 나올 겁니다 
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	Okay, what have we learned
		about D'Stefano?
		스테파노에 대해 추가적으로 밝혀진건?
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	Grew up near the Oregon border.
		오레곤주 경계 근처에서 자랐고 
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	Brother claimed D'Stefano was
		getting his life back on track
		그 형은 스테파노가 가석방 출소 뒤 
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	since he was released on parole.
		정신차리고 살려 했다 말했습니다 
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	They always say that,
		don't they?
		꼭 그렇게 말은 하지 
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	All tracks, though--
		new town, new job, fresh start--
		새로운 도시에서 새 직장을 가지고 
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:45	leave all
		the bad influences behind.
		과거로부터 절연한 새출발이었죠 
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:47	Getting fired would have
		put a dent in that.
		그런데 해고당했으니 좌절이 컸겠군 
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	What'd he do
		after he lost his job?
		실직하고 나서는 어땠지? 
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	Nothing.
		아무것도요 
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	What do you mean, "nothing"?
		아무것도라니? 
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	He didn't get another job?
		He didn't go back up north?
		다른 일자리를 구하거나
		고향으로 가지 않았어? 
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	Nope, he just hung around in
		San Refugio until he was killed.
		계속 인근에 있었어요, 죽을 때까지 
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	Here's something.
		I called his parole officer.
		그게 뭔가 있어요. 
		담당 감찰관과 얘기해봤는데 
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	He said D'Stefano
		got into a scuffle
		교외의 술집에서 정체불명의 사람과 
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	with an unknown individual
		at a bar outside San Refugio.
		실랑이를 벌인 적이 있다고 했어요 
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	P.O. gave him a break
		and let it slide.
		감찰관이 떼어놓고 한번 봐줬답니다 
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	When was that?
		그게 뭐였는데? 
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	A couple months ago,
		after he got fired.
		두세달 전, 해고된 다음이구요 
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	Okay, what about the casino?
		We finding any connection?
		카지노에 대해선 없어? 
		아무 연관되는 일이라도? 
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	Yeah, owner's a guy
		named Nicky Shaw.
		오너는 니키 쇼라는 사람인데 
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	He's reputed to be mobbed up,
		for what it's worth.
		확실친 않지만 배후에 폭력조직이
		있다고 합니다 
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	Cho, you and Rigsby
		look into D'Stefano's movements
		조는 릭스비랑 사망 시각까지의 
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	leading up to his murder.
		See if you can find anything.
		스테파노 행적을 조사해보고 
		나오는게 있으면 연락해 
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	Grace, follow up
		on the bar fight.
		그레이스는 그 시비 났다는 술집을
		조사해봐 
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	Will do, boss.
		알겠습니다 
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:25	Are you planning on taking
		any interest in this case?
		이 사건에 흥미를 가질 계획이긴
		한거니? 
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	I'm looking for clues.
		실마리 찾는 중이야 
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:32	Yes, in the newspaper.
		신문에서 
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	Besides,
		I heard every single word.
		또한 너희들 하는 얘기는 빠짐없이
		듣고 있었어 
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	Really?
		정말?
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	Yes.
		그럼 
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	Our victim is either
		a hardened criminal
		우리 피해자가 무시무시한 전과자 혹은 
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	or a tragically misunderstood
		Dickensian waif.
		디킨스 소설에 나올 것 같은
		불행한 남자일수 있다는 말 
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	Also, the casino may be
		connected to the Mafia.
		그리고 카지노가 마피아와
		손잡았을 수 있다는 말 
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	Okay, so what do you think?
		그래, 네가 생각하는 건 뭔데? 
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:50	"What do I think?"
		내가 뭘 생각하냐고? 
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	I think I'm hungry.
		배가 고프다는 것 
00:07:54	 
		 
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:09	Howdy.
		안녕
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	What can I do you for?
		뭘 도와줄까요? 
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	I'm curious about a fight
		that happened here
		두세달 전 이 남자가 연루되었다는 
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	a couple months ago,
		involving this guy.
		소동에 관해 조사하고 있어요 
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	That's Ryan. Yeah. They went
		at each other pretty good.
		라이언이로군, 그날 꽤 시끄러웠지 
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	You knew Mr. D'Stefano?
		스테파노씨를 알고 있습니까? 
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	What's this about?
		왜 묻는거요? 
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	He was murdered. You don't
		know anything about that?
		그는 살해됐습니다. 뭐 들은 게 없습니까? 
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	What happened?
		어쩌다?
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	He was shot.
		총에 맞았어요 
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	What can you tell me
		about him?
		어떤 사람이었죠? 
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	You know,
		he was a good guy, just...
		좋은 사람이었어요 
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	hotheaded.
		좀 다혈질이었지만 
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	Is that how
		the fight started?
		그래서 시비가 붙은 건가요? 
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	Yeah, I mean, after he lost
		his job at the casino,
		카지노에서 짤리고 나서 
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	he was always going on and on
		about getting back at them,
		복수하겠다는 말 뿐이었어요 
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	so, you know, when the guy
		who fired him showed up one day,
		그래서 직장 상사가 나타나자 
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	yeah, Ryan lost it.
		머리 뚜껑이 열린거죠 
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	Was that Shaw,
		the casino owner?
		그게 카지노 오너인 쇼였나요? 
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Or the other guy,
		head of security?
		아니면 보안 담당자? 
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	I don't know. Big black guy
		with a shaved head.
		모르겠어요. 머리를 민 거구의 흑인 남자인데 
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	Finished eating?
		식사는 마쳤니? 
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	D'Stefano got in a bar fight
		스테파노하고 술집에서 싸운 남자는 
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	with the security guy
		from the casino--Dante Holmes.
		카지노 보안담당 단테 홈즈였어 
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	I think we should
		talk to him again.
		다시 가서 얘기해야겠어 
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	Oh, interesting.
		I'll take care of it.
		그거 재밌네, 내가 알아서 할게 
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	W-what do you mean?
		Where are you?
		무슨 소리야? 지금 어디 있는데? 
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	Uh, be back soon.
		We'll talk then.
		곧 돌아갈게, 가서 애기해 
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	Sorry about that, Mr. Shaw.
		미안합니다, 쇼씨
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	So rumor has it
		that you're a made man.
		소문에 따르면 자수성가하신 분이라던데
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	Did you have D'Stefano whacked,
		rubbed out, smudged,
		스테파노를 청소하거나 처분하거나
		찍소리 못하게 하거나 
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	whatever it is
		the phrase you use?
		아무튼 마피아 용어로 죽이셨나요? 
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	That's funny.
		이것 재밌군 
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	Look, is it an embarrassment
		that we hired a convicted felon?
		전과자를 고용한 걸로 드러나 
		당황했냐고? 
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	Of course.
		물론이지 
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	Does that implicate us
		in his death? Not at all.
		그게 우리가 그 자의 죽음에
		연루되었다는 뜻인가? 그럴리가 
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	Does that make us liable
		in any way? I don't think so.
		그렇다고 당신네가 우리 말을
		믿어줄까? 그럴것 같지도 않군 
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:41	What about the fight
		that you had with D'Stefano?
		스테파노와 싸우셨다면서요?
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	What fight?
		싸우다니?
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:49	He was drunk and angry at me
		for canning him.
		취한데다 해고당한 일로 앙심을
		품었습니다
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:53	Can't blame him for that.
		인지상정이죠 
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	So I tuned him up a little.
		그래서 가볍게 손 좀 봐줬습니다 
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	Saw no reason to speak about it,
		딱히 보고할 일이 아니라 생각했습니다 
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	seeing as there was no
		connection to him getting shot.
		그 자가 총을 맞은 일과는
		아무 관련이 없어 보였으니까요 
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	Well, that seems
		reasonable enough,
		그거 꽤 합리적인 생각이네요 
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	and who wants
		that kind of publicity?
		게다가 그런 일이 알려지는걸
		누가 반기겠습니까?
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:06	Right.
		그래 
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	Look, I run
		a nice establishment here.
		난 여기서 건실한 사업체를 운영하고 있소
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	Everything is the best.
		모든 것이 잘 돌아가고 있어 
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	Next month,
		다음 달이면 
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	I've got an international
		poker tournament coming in.
		여기서 국제 포커대회도 개최해 
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	Top cable coverage.
		It's gonna be big.
		유명 케이블 방송사들이 취재를 오고
		성대할거야 
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	You didn't know
		about the fight?
		싸움에 대해선 몰랐습니까?
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	No.
		음
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	And you don't mind
		that Holmes here
		여기 홈즈씨가 그 일을 
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	was withholding
		that information from you?
		보고 않은 사실도 개의치 않으시고? 
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	No.
		그래 
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Hmm.
		흐음
00:10:31	 
		 
00:10:31	Look, is there anything else
		you'd like to know?
		우리가 알아야만 하는 뭔가 
		또 있는거요? 
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:33	My business is an open book
		to law enforcement.
		내 사업은 이미 경찰이 손바닥처럼
		들여다 보고 있소 
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	Mm. Mm.
		으음
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:38	Ohh.
		 
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:44	No, I'm fine, thanks.
		뭐, 더는 필요없습니다. 고마워요 
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:53	Enjoy the show.
		재밌게 보시오 
00:10:56	 
		 
00:11:04	What's up?
		뭐 나왔어? 
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	We found the gas station where
		D'Stefano and his passenger
		스테파노와 동행자가 기름 넣고 
		음료수를 사 마신
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	got gas and sodas.
		We got an I.D. on the passenger.
		주유소를 찾아냈고 동행자의
		신원을 확인했습니다 
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	Her name's Holly Danvers.
		이름은 홀리 덴버 
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	Paid for the drinks
		using a credit card.
		덴버의 신용카드로 음료수를 샀고 
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	Hasn't used it since.
		현재까지 추가 결제 기록은 없습니다 
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	Couple of drug priors.
		There's an address there.
		마약 전과가 좀 있고 주소는 여기입니다 
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	Nice work.
		Go and get her, but be careful.
		잘했어, 가서 데려오되 조심해 
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	If she executed D'Stefano
		in cold blood,
		스테파노를 죽인게 그 여자라면 
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	she's likely to put up
		a fight.
		격렬하게 저항할 가능성이 있어 
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	All right.
		We'll call in, we get anything.
		알겠습니다, 상황 봐서 보고하겠습니다 
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:39	Can I, uh, help you gents?
		뭘 도와드릴까요? 
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	CBI.
		CBI입니다 
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	Do you know a woman
		named Holly Danvers?
		홀리 덴버라는 여성을 아십니까? 
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	Sure. We know Holly.
		알지요 
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Trailer 60. Fine tenant.
		60번 트레일러예요, 얌전한 세입자죠 
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	Huh. Her roommate Cheryl's
		a pushy one, though.
		집을 같이 쓰는 셰릴은 좀 드센 편이지만 
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	Complains about
		the water pressure.
		수압에 대해 불평하곤 해요 
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	Is she in her trailer?
		트레일러에 있습니까?
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	No, she went away with a young
		fella couple of days ago.
		며칠 전에 어떤 젊은이와 떠났어요 
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	My wife sees everything.
		우리 집사람은 놓치는게 없다오 
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	Nobody gets away
		with anything around here.
		도둑질이란 불가능하지 
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	You recognize this man?
		이 남자 알아보시겠습니까?
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:11	Yeah, that's him.
		아까 말한 그 남자예요 
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	Yeah, I remember because
		one of 'em forgot something,
		둘 중 하나가 뭘 잊었다며 
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	and then he went
		back to get it.
		남자가 도로 가지러 와서 기억하고 있지 
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	Can we talk to the roommate?
		룸메이트와 얘기할 수 있을까요? 
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	I... don't think she's in.
		집에 있는지 모르겠는데 
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	Oh.
		 
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	I stopped by earlier
		to check her propane,
		프로판 가스를 확인해주러 아침에 갔는데 
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	but, uh, she didn't answer.
		안에서 대답이 없더라고 
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	Any chance we could take
		a look around the trailer?
		트레일러 주변을 봐도 됩니까? 
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	Be a big help to us.
		크게 도움이 될 텐데요 
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Oh, of course you can.
		We run an honest place.
		물론이지, 우린 정직하게 장사한다오 
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	Go get the keys.
		열쇠 가져와요 
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	Yes, ma'am.
		그럽지요 
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	Head over.
		먼저 가봐요 
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	He'll come meet you.
		바깥 양반이 곧 뒤따라 갈테니 
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	Thank you.
		감사합니다 
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	Thank you.
		감사합니다 
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:48	CBI.
		We need to speak to you.
		CBI입니다, 말씀 좀 나누시죠 
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	See? Nobody home.
		집에 아무도 없다니까 
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Can you unlock it
		for me, please?
		대신 열어주시겠습니까?
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	Yeah, sure.
		물론
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:59	Stand back.
		물러서 계세요 
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:06	Hello?
		여보세요? 
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:11	Your park manager
		let us in.
		캠핑장 관리인과 함께 왔습니다 
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:24	Cheryl?
		셰릴?
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	Cheryl?
		셰릴?
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:35	Prepare yourselves,
		ladies and gentlemen,
		신사 숙녀 여러분 
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:38	to be terrified and amazed.
		경이의 체험에 앞서 각오를 단단히 하십쇼 
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:44	Hey. What did you do to me?
		I can't feel my toes.
		나한테 무슨 짓을 한 거예요?
		발가락 감각이 없어 
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:51	Where are my toes?
		내 발이 어디 갔지? 
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	I can't feel my toes.
		발가락 감각이 없어 
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	Hey. Hey, hey,
		look, look, look.
		이봐요, 저기 봐요 
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	Her head's in a box,
		but she's still talking.
		상자 안에 머리만 남았는데 
		아직도 말을 하네 
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:02	That is crazy.
		미쳤어, 진짜 재밌다 
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	Crazy.
		재밌어 
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	Holly Danvers is
		our number one suspect.
		홀리 덴버는 현재 가장
		유력한 용의자야 
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	What do we know about her?
		어디까지 알고 있지? 
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	Well, according
		to her parole records,
		가석방 기록에 의하면 
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	Holly Danvers did everything
		she was supposed to.
		줄곧 모범적인 모습을 보였습니다
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:13	She got clean and stayed clean.
		마약에서도 완전히 깨끗해졌구요 
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	Passed all her drug tests,
		went to regular counseling,
		검사도 통과하고 의무 상담도 
		꼬박꼬박 출석했답니다 
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	even got a good job
		as a waitress
		빅 프랭크란 곳에서 
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	at a place
		called Big Frank's.
		조건이 좋은 웨이트리스 일도 
		얻었어요 
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Big Frank's
		outside San Refugio?
		산 리푸지오 외곽의 그 빅 프랭크?
00:14:22	 
		 
00:14:22	Yeah.
		그래 
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	That's where D'Stefano
		got into his fight.
		스테파노가 소동을 일으킨 곳인데 
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	They must have met there.
		거기서 만난게 틀림없어요 
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	Love triangle gone wrong,
		maybe?
		삼각관계 같은 거였나? 
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	D'Stefano and Danvers hook up,
		덴버가 스테파노와 사귀는 중인데
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	then she catches him cheating
		on her with the roommate,
		룸메이트가 끼어든 걸 눈치채고 
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	kills 'em both.
		둘 다 죽여버린거지 
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	Does she have
		a history of violence?
		폭력전과가 있나? 
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	No.
		없습니다 
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:34	We need to dig deeper.
		더 조사해야겠어 
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	Van Pelt, go to Big Frank's.
		See what you can learn.
		반펠트, 빅 프랭크로 돌아가 탐문해 
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	All right.
		알겠습니다 
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:42	Order up!
		주문 나왔습니다!
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	Holly? She's one of
		my best waitresses. Why?
		홀리? 여기 최고의 웨이트리스였죠. 왜요?
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	When was the last time
		you spoke with her?
		마지막으로 대화한건 언제죠? 
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	She was supposed
		to be working today.
		오늘 원래는 일을 나왔어야 해요 
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	She called in this morning, said
		she had to miss a couple shifts.
		오늘 아침에 전화해 당분간 
		나올 수가 없다고 하더라구요 
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	Order up!
		주문 나왔어!
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	She called in?
		What'd she say?
		전화를 했다구요? 뭐라던가요? 
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:57	Needed time off
		for a personal matter.
		개인 사정으로 휴가를 내야 된다고 
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	Seemed kind of cranky,
		so I didn't push.
		낌새가 이상해 캐묻진 않았어요 
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	Like I said,
		she's one of my best. Hey!
		말했다시피 홀리는 여기 최고의 
		웨이트리스입니다 
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	Hello. Order up.
		여기, 주문 받아가 
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	Thank you.
		고마워 
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:19	Hey, Patrick. What is it?
		패트릭, 무슨 일이야? 
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:21	Well, I caught the show.
		It was great. Very smooth.
		쇼 잘 봤어. 멋지더라, 흐름도 부드럽고 
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	Uh, the Sphinx, nicely played.
		Love the Blammo Box.
		스핑크스쇼, 멋졌고 
		머리 절단 상자 너무 마음에 들었어 
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	Of course it's all about
		the assistant. Patrick.
		물론 다 여기 조수님 덕이죠, 패트릭입니다 
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	Oh, I'm Trish.
		트리시라고 해요 
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	We're old friends.
		잭하곤 친구예요 
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	Oh.
		 
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:35	Yeah.
		 
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	Sorry.
		Uh, this is Vincent and Skiddy.
		아, 여기는 빈센트와 스키디 
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	They're young magicians
		I am mentoring.
		내가 가르치는 젊은 마술사들이야 
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:43	Hi.
		안녕하세요 
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Jack and I used to work
		the carnival circuit together.
		잭하고는 유랑극단에서 같이 일했어요 
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	Mentoring, huh?
		Well, that's great.
		네가 가르친다고? 그거 멋진데 
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Used to be this guy was so tight
		he wouldn't tell you the time.
		예전엔 너무 쌀쌀맞아
		시간도 못 물어볼 정도였어요 
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	Uh, still owes me 50 bucks
		from what, 16 years ago?
		16년전 나한테 50달러 빚진거 알지? 
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	I don't remember
		this 50 bucks.
		50달러라니 기억나지 않아 
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:57	Of course you don't.
		You know what?
		못하시겠지, 하지만 말이야 
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	I'm gonna let that slide.
		Anyway, I have to run.
		까짓거 눈감아 주겠어, 이제 가봐야겠어요 
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	Um, it was a great act.
		Nice to meet you.
		멋진 쇼였고 만나서 반가웠습니다 
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	Be good.
		열심히 하세요 
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	Thanks. Hey, uh, I'll call you.
		We'll--we'll get together, okay?
		고마워, 내가 전화할게 언제 한번 보자 
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	- Sure, Jack.
		- All right.
		- 물론이지, 잭 
		- 그래 
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:42	Hello, Lisbon.
		리스본
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	You wondering
		when I'm coming back?
		내가 언제쯤 돌아올거냐고? 
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	No. Not at all.
		아니, 그건 전혀 궁금하지 않아 
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	I wouldn't want to impose.
		강요하고 싶지도 않고 
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	Whenever you find the time
		is okay with me.
		언제든 너만 시간나면 난 오케이야 
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	Ah. Sarcasm.
		Doesn't suit you much at all.
		이야, 비꼬는 리스본이라니
		너한테는 별로 어울리지 않는걸
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:56	I'm working the case.
		In fact, I've almost cracked it.
		나 일하고 있어, 게다가 거의 해결 직전이야 
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	Really? So have we.
		그래? 우리도 그런데 
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	Really? What do you got?
		그래? 어디까지 진척됐길래? 
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	It looks to be
		a crime of passion.
		치정극인것 같아 
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	A woman named Holly Danvers
		was the last person
		홀리 덴버란 여자가 
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	to see D'Stefano
		before his death,
		스테파노 죽기 전에 마지막으로 
		함께 있었고 
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	and we found her roommate
		dead in their apartment.
		그 여자 룸메이트가 죽어서 발견됐어 
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	Ahh.
		아 
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	Yeah, and Danvers
		was a waitress
		그리고 덴버는 스테파노가 
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	at the bar
		D'Stefano got in a fight at.
		시비 붙은 술집의 웨이트리스였어 
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	Ooh. Well, now it seems
		to make sense.
		이제 좀 말이 되는 것 같네 
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	Yeah, because I just
		explained it to you.
		이렇게까지 얘기해줬기 말인데, 
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	When are you coming back?
		너 대체 언제 돌아올거니? 
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:28	We'll talk later, Lisbon.
		Thanks.
		나중에 얘기하자, 리스본 
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	Wait. Jane...
		야, 제인.... 
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:38	Security's too tight.
		보안이 너무 빡세요 
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	It was 12 minutes, man.
		We checked it twice.
		12분이라고, 두번이나 체크했어요 
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	Sorry, man.
		미안하게 됐습니다 
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	Gosh, guys. There's gotta...
		이봐, 그래도 무슨 방법이... 
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	There's no way, man.
		불가능해요
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:58	 
		 
00:18:03	Thanks. Thank you.
		알았어, 고마워요 
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:09	Hello, Jack.
		안녕, 잭 
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:12	Where'd you come from?
		대관절 어디서 튀어 나온거야? 
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:16	I know what's going on.
		무슨 일인지 알겠어 
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	What are you talking about?
		You--you been following me?
		무슨 소리야, 너 내 뒤라도 밟은거야? 
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	The way you fell apart
		onstage when I yelled
		공연 중에 내가 야유했을때 
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	was the first clue.
		집중력이 너무 쉽게 깨졌지, 
		그게 첫째 단서 
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:27	Then you lied about
		knowing D'Stefano,
		그리고 스테파노를 모른다고 거짓말했고 
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	and now you're palling around
		with a couple of ex-cons.
		지금은 전직 사기꾼들과 
		뭔가 모의하고 있군 
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	Your friends are more
		professional than they look.
		저 친구들 겉보기보단 훨씬
		프로들이야 
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	I must say that. They did
		a good job of casing this place.
		안팎을 정찰하는 솜씨가 꽤 쓸만했어 
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	What do you mean?
		What place?
		무슨 소리야? 정찰이라니? 
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	You're planning
		to rob the casino, Jack.
		이 카지노를 털려는 거잖아, 잭
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	There's no point
		in hiding it.
		숨겨봐야 소용없어 
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	Shut up.
		조용히 해 
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	You can get me
		in a lot of trouble,
		사람들이 듣고 오해라도 하면
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	people hear you
		talking like that.
		난 곤경에 빠진다고 
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	Question is, why? You're not
		the casino-robbing type.
		내 질문은, 이유가 뭐야?
		넌 카지노 털이범 타입이 아니야 
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	I don't know
		what you're talking about,
		네가 무슨 소리 하는지 모르겠다 
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	and you should
		leave it alone.
		그리고 날 좀 가만 놔둬 
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	You're scared--
		I knew that from the first--
		뭔가를 두려워하고 있군, 처음부터 눈치챘어 
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	but not for yourself,
		for someone you care about.
		하지만 네 문제가 아니라 
		네 가까운 사람 때문이야 
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	Cut it out. I mean it.
		Walk away.
		거기까지 해, 경고했어.
		못 본척 지나가 
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	Holly Danvers
		is your girlfriend.
		홀리 덴버는 여자친구지? 
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	She's been kidnapped
		누군가 홀리 덴버를 납치한 뒤 
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	by whoever's making you
		rob the casino.
		너더러 카지노를 털라고 시킨거지? 
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:09	Yes.
		그래 
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	But it can't be robbed.
		It's impossible.
		하지만 털 수가 없어, 불가능해 
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	Really?
		정말이야?
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	I mean, it's not Fort Knox.
		여기가 포트 녹스라도 돼? 
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Is it really that hard?
		그 정도로 어려워? 
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	I've been looking at it
		every which way.
		모든 가능한 수를 다 살펴봤어 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	I can't see how it can be done,
		어떡해야 할지 모르겠어 
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	and they've got Holly,
		그럼 놈들은 홀리를 죽일거야 
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:27	and there's nothing
		I can do to save her.
		그런데 내가 할 수 있는 일이 없어 
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	Hey, whoa, whoa.
		진정, 진정해 
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	Don't worry.
		I can help you.
		걱정하지 마, 내가 도와줄게 
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	Okay?
		알았지? 
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	What are you doing?
		어쩌려고? 
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	Calling the police.
		경찰에 전화해야지 
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	No, no, no, they said,
		any hint of the cops,
		안돼, 경찰을 끌어들이지 말랬어 
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	and they'll kill her.
		They told me.
		그럼 홀리를 죽일 거랫어 
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	Okay.
		알겠어 
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	Then we have to do it
		the other way.
		그럼 다른 식으로 하는 수밖에 
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	What's the other way?
		다른 식이라니? 
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:51	I rob the casino for you.
		널 위해 카지노를 털어줄게 
00:19:54	 
		 
00:20:00	Here's what they sent me.
		이게 내가 받은거야 
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:06	You have any idea
		who sent it?
		누가 보냈는지 알겠어? 
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	No.
		전혀 
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	But you know how it is.
		I meet all kinds of people.
		하지만 너도 알거야, 난 별별 사람들 다 만나 
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	There's some hard cases in
		this town. It could be anyone.
		이 근방엔 미친놈도 꽤 있지,
		범인은 누구라도 될 수 있어 
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	Why now?
		왜 지금이지? 
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:16	The first of the month is
		when the vault is the fullest,
		매달 1일은 카지노 금고가 가득 차는 때야 
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	so whoever's doing this
		knows how the casino works.
		누구 소행이든 내부 사정을 아는 자야 
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	Okay. Well, I'll take a look
		around and see what can be done.
		좋아, 그럼 한바퀴 둘러보며 
		어떡할지 구상하자 
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	Can't be done.
		안된대두 
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	Vince and Skiddy agree,
		빈스와 스키디가 안된대 
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	and they've done things
		like this before.
		그들은 경험도 있어 
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	And they're doing this out of
		the goodness of their heart?
		그들이 정말 악착같이 해보려고
		살펴봤을까? 
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	Of course not.
		그건 아니겠지 
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	They don't know anything about
		the kidnapping or about Holly.
		두 사람은 인질극이나 홀리에 
		대한 건 전혀 몰라 
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	Nobody can know.
		아무도 알 수 없지 
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	What about Trish?
		트리시는? 
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	She's involved, isn't she?
		How much does she know?
		트리시도 한패지? 거긴 얼마나
		알고 있어? 
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:42	Only what Vince and Skiddy know,
		nothing more.
		빈스와 스키디가 아는 만큼이야
		그 이상은 몰라 
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	Okay.
		알았어 
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	Well, we'll meet tomorrow
		to discuss it more. Um...
		내일 만나서 구체적으로 얘기하자 
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	And I think we should
		introduce me to your team.
		그리고 너희 팀에 날 정식으로
		소개시켜 주는게 좋을 것 같아 
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:58	Hey, Jane.
		제인, 
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	 
		 
00:21:00	Uh... thanks.
		고맙다 
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	Yeah. Sure.
		그래 
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:09	Hey. Found something.
		뭔가 찾았어요 
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	What is it?
		뭔데? 
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	Remember Hellion
		told Jane and Lisbon
		잭 헬리온이 제인과 리스본에게 
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:13	he didn't know D'Stefano?
		스테파노를 모른다고 했죠? 
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	Yeah.
		그래 
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:15	Take a look at this.
		이걸 봐요 
00:21:17

00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:24	No. Just found it.
		방금 찾은 거예요 
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	What's with the flowers?

00:21:32	Yeah.
		응 
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:33	Oh. Okay.

		고마워요, 조심해서 들어가요 
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:43	Wow.
		 
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:50	That goes there...
		 
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:52	Who is it?
		누구예요? 
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:54	It's us.
		저희요 
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:56	What's this about, Hellion?
		어떻게 된 거예요, 헬리온? 
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	You're late. Sit down.
		We got a lot of work to do.
		늦었군, 들어와 앉아. 할 일이 태산이야 
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:03	What's he doing here?
		이 사람 여기서 뭐해요? 
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	Jane's coming in
		on the job with us.
		제인도 우리와 함께 하기로 했어 
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:08	I don't know about that.
		금시초문인데 
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	How do we know
		we can trust this guy?
		우리가 이 자를 어떻게 믿죠? 
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	It's okay. You can trust him.
		He's one of us.
		괜찮아, 믿어도 돼. 같은 출신이야 
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Says you.
		I'm not doing this with him.
		그건 당신 얘기고, 난 같이 일 못해요 
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	Well, fine.

00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:23	I didn't think you really
		had the chops for it anyway.
		여기 썩 재능이 있는 것 같지도 않고 
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:36	Show us your plan.

00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	Doesn't mean

		the lock to the vault.
		처음 순서는 금고 자물쇠를 해결하는 거야 
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Okay,

00:24:04	You better be on the level...

		그래 
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:19	Let's get to work.
		움직이자고 
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:22	Jane? We need to talk to you.
		제인, 우리 얘기 좀 해 
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:24	Well, that sounds ominous.
		I need to talk to you as well.
		이것 불길하군, 나도 마침 할 얘기가 있는데 
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	Your friend Jack Hellion
		looks good for this.
		네 친구 잭 헬리온이 수상해 
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:30	You think?
		정말이야? 
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	He knew our victim D'Stefano.
		스테파노를 알고 있었어요 
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	And he was dating
		Holly Danvers.
		홀리 덴버와 사귀는 사이고 
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	We think they were
		in it together.
		홀리 덴버와 함께한 것 같습니다 
00:24:36	 
		 
00:24:36	"In" what?
		뭘 함께해? 
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	The murder of Ryan D'Stefano.
		스테파노를 죽였을 거라고 
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:39	@@/Oh.@@\ Yes. Uh...
		아 그래.. 
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:41	Well, it's a theory.
		하나의 가설이네 
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	And you think it's wrong.
		네 보기엔 틀렸다는거고 
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:46	Well, I know it's wrong.
		I mean, it's way off the mark.
		알고말고, 완전히 헛다리 짚은거거든 
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	I'm--I'm sorry.
		참 유감이지만 말야 
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	And you know the right story,
		of course.
		그리고 너만이 진실을 알고 있다 
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	Yes, I do, and I know how
		to close this case neatly.
		그렇지, 이 사건을 말끔하게 
		끝낼 방법 또한 
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:56	So? Do tell.
		그래서요? 말씀하세요 
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	I shall, but we're in
		a very tricky situation here.
		할건데, 지금 상황이 복잡해 
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	There is a life at stake,
		사람 목숨이 걸려 있어 
00:25:02	 
		 
00:25:02	and you're gonna
		have to bear with me,
		그리고 여러분이 인내심을 가져야 해 
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	because what I'm about to say
		might sound a little crazy,
		왜냐면 내가 지금부터 할 얘기가
		조금 미친 소리처럼 들릴 거라서 
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	but...
		하지만... 
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	trust me.
		It is the only way.
		날 믿어. 이게 유일한 방법이야 
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:10	He said, "crazy idea."
		미친 소리를 할거란다 
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	He said, "trust me."
		믿어달라고도 하는군요 
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:12	Always a bad sign.
		나쁜 징조인데 
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	Well, listen,
		I'm just a consultant here.
		뭐, 알았어. 나야 여기 자문에 불과하고 
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	We don't have to
		do this all together.
		꼭 여럿이 다함께 할 필요는 없지 
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:16	I mean, I can manage
		on my own somehow.
		나 혼자서든 어떻게 해볼거니까 
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	Wait.
		기다려 
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:25	I will bear with you.
		인내심을 가져주지 
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:30	Talk.
		말해봐 
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:51	Uh, it's the kidnappers.
		인질범들이다 
00:25:52	 
		 
00:25:52	They've given us a location
		일이 끝난 뒤에 
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:53	to drop the money
		after the job is done.
		돈가방을 가져갈 위치를 줬어 
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:55	Well, tell 'em
		we're not doing anything
		홀리가 살아있다는 걸 보여주지 않으면 
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	until we know
		that Holly's alive.
		아무것도 하지 않겠다고 해 
00:25:57	 
		 
00:25:57	Okay.
		 
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:02	Oh. They're
		sending something.
		뭔가 보냈네 
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	Oh, my God.
		이걸 어떡해 
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:12	Okay, keep it together, Jack.
		We got a job to do here.
		좋아, 정신 똑바로 차려, 잭 
		우린 이제 할 일이 있어 
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:16	Okay? Text them back.
		지시한 위치에 
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	Tell 'em we'll take the money
		to the drop site
		돈을 가져가겠다고 
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	just like they said.
		다시 문자 보내 
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:26	Okay?
		괜찮지? 
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	Okay.
		괜찮아 
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	Let's go.

		준비됐죠? 
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	Uh, there is one small thing--
		uh, those police
		주의사항이 하나 있어, 경찰들 말야 
00:26:41

		D'Stefano's murder--
		스테파노 사건 수사하는 
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	they're here again.
		여기 다시 왔어 
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	I just wanted you to know so you
		don't freak out if you see them.
		그러니 경찰을 보더라도 너무
		당황하지 마 
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	Oh, crap.
		이런 젠장 
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	We gotta call it off.
		오늘밤은 철수해요 
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:50	No, no. No, we don't.
		아니야 
00:26:51

		전부 계획대로 할거야 
00:26:53

00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	They're not even gonna be

00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	We do it right

		경찰들 코앞에서 해치우자고, 알겠지? 
00:26:59	 
		 
00:26:59	Okay.

00:27:50	Hello, Grace. What luck
		running into you here.
		안녕, 그레이스. 여기서 마주치다니
		뜻밖이야 
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	Hi, Jane. Am I late?
		안녕, 제인씨. 제가 늦었나요? 
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:54	Not at all. Follow me.
		전혀, 전혀. 따라와 
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:57	My next demonstration
		is something I learned
		제가 다음으로 보여드릴 묘기는 
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	from a yogi mystic
		in Dharamshala--
		다람살라의 수행자에게서 배운 것으로 
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	how to see by using
		your astral mind,
		육체의 감각이 아닌 
00:28:07	 
		 
00:28:07	not your physical senses.
		마음의 눈으로 사물을 보는 능력입니다 
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	I will need a volunteer.
		자원자가 필요합니다 
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:14	You, sir.
		선생님
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	No.
		됐어요 
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:18	Come on, folks. Give him a hand.
		He's just shy.
		여러분, 큰 박수 보내주시죠. 
		부끄러움이 많은 분인것 같군요 
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:20	Go on.
		나가봐 
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	@@/♪@@\
		 
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:31	I want you to
		examine this hood.
		이 덮개를 살펴봐 주십시오 
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	It's impossible to see
		out of it. Is that not so?
		전혀 앞을 볼 수 없겠지요? 
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:37	Okay. Uh...
		그러네요 
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	Yes, you can't see out of it.
		안 보이겠어요 
00:28:43	 
		 
00:28:43	Thank you.
		Please step over here.
		감사합니다, 이쪽으로 와주세요 
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:50	Okay.
		네 
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	It's coming up.
		이제 준비해 
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:57	Can you see?
		앞이 보이나요? 
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	No.
		아니요 
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:01	Great, now from our volunteer,
		그럼 자원자로부터 
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	could I get an object?
		Any object, please.
		물건 하나만 빌릴까요? 
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:09	Can I have a spot
		here, please?
		여기 조명을 주시겠어요? 
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:12	What is the first object
		I am showing you?
		지금 보여드리는 물건은 뭐죠? 
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:17	Is it a wallet?
		지갑인가요? 
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:19	Ohh.
		 
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:23	You can go back to your seat.
		Thank you.
		자리로 돌아가셔도 됩니다, 감사합니다 
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	I will now come out
		to the audience.
		이제는 관객 여러분께 가보죠 
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	Anyone can give me
		an object.
		아무나 제게 물건을 빌려주세요 
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:33	Okay. Hat and glasses.
		모자랑 안경 
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:53	Dante Holmes.
		단테 홈즈씨 
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	Like to introduce you
		to Grace Van Pelt.
		그레이스 반펠트 요원을 
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	She's an agent at the CBI.
		소개해 드리죠 
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	She'd like to ask you
		a few questions.
		몇가지 질문할게 있다고 하는데요 
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	I think you two are
		gonna get along famously.
		두분이서 말씀이 잘 통하실 것 같습니다 
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	Hi.
		안녕하세요 
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:07	So, um... you're

00:30:29	- Nobody saw us.
		- You get the key?
		- 아무도 
		- 열쇠는? 
00:30:31

00:30:42	Okay.
		좋아 
00:30:44

00:30:48	Okay.
		 
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:53	Ha.
		 
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	All set.
		준비됐습니다 
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	You have roughly
		five and a half minutes.
		시간은 약 5분하고 30초 있어 
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:04	Good, good, good, good,
		good, good, good, good.
		좋아 좋아 좋아 
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:17	Okay, gentlemen, I have to
		get this key back to Holmes
		그럼 홈즈가 알기 전에 
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	before he realizes it's gone.
		열쇠 돌려주러 갈게 
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	Wait.
		잠깐 
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:26	My hands.
		내 손이 
00:31:27	 
		 
00:31:27	What?
		왜? 
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:30	I don't think
		I can do this.
		못하겠어 
00:31:31	 
		 
00:31:31	I'm not cut out
		to be a criminal.
		난 범죄자 체질이 아닌가봐 
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:35	All right.
		알겠어 
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	You're gonna have to get this
		key back into Holmes' pocket.
		당신이 가서 이걸 주머니에 넣고 와요 
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:40	I'll stay here and help.
		Right side jacket pocket.
		내가 남아 도와줄테니. 
		오른쪽 주머니입니다 
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:44	Remember--
		right side jacket pocket.
		오른쪽 주머니예요 
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	Okay.
		알았어요 
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:52	Okay, Jack.
		Hey, look at this coin.
		좋아, 잭. 동전을 바라봐
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	Look at how bright that is.
		동전이 반짝이는 걸 자세히 봐 
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	Look at the way
		the light hits it. Eh?
		빛이 떨어지는 방향이 보이지? 
00:31:59	 
		 
00:32:04	As you breathe,
		숨 쉴 때마다 
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	you will feel your body
		slowly relax.
		네 몸이 천천히 이완된다 
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	I think you will be able
		to tell what I have now.
		제 손에 있는게 뭘까요? 
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:13	Is it a pair of glasses?
		안경인가요? 
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:16	See you soon, I hope.
		조만간 보자꾸나 
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:17	Yeah, good luck.
		행운을 빌어요 
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:22	When I click my fingers,
		Jack,
		내가 손가락을 퉁기면 
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	you will feel
		calm and relaxed.
		네 긴장은 풀어지고 기분은 차분해진다 
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	It'll be easy
		to open the safe.
		금고를 여는게 너무나 쉬워져 
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	When I click my fingers,
		Jack,
		내가 손가락을 퉁기면, 잭 
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	you will open the safe
		with great ease...
		너는 신속하게, 또 간단히 
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	and quickness.
		금고를 열게 돼 
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:44	What do you say
		we open the safe?
		이제 금고를 열어야지? 
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	Okay, here we go.
		좋아, 까짓거 
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:51	Grace, have you seen Jane?
		그레이스, 제인 봤어? 
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	Um, he was here
		a second ago.
		아까 전만 해도 여기 있었는데요 
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:56	Oh.
		 
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	Careful, son.
		조심하세요 
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	Excuse me, sir.
		Um, which way to the bathroom?
		죄송합니다만 화장실은 어디로 가야 하죠? 
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	Right over there.
		저기서 오른쪽으로요 
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:09	Excuse me, agents.
		I've gotta get back to work.
		죄송하지만 일하러 돌아가야겠군요 
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:30	 
		 
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:37	You guys ready?
		준비 됐어요? 
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	Let's go. You need
		to get back to the stage.
		얼른 무대로 돌아가요 
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:47	Okay. I got the rest of this.
		나머지는 내가 챙길테니 
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	Time to bring the van
		round to the loading dock.
		하역장으로 밴을 가져다 놔 
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	Okay.
		알겠어요 
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:57	 
		 
00:34:58	Thank you,
		ladies and gentlemen.
		감사합니다 
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:00	And for our last demonstration,
		may I have an object, please?
		저희 공연 마지막 순서로, 
		물건 하나를 빌릴 수 있을까요? 
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	This will do quite nicely.
		 
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	I think you will be able
		to tell what I have now.
		제가 뭘 갖고 있는지 맞춰보시죠 
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	You are holding...
		손에 있는 건 
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	A set of car keys.
		차 열쇠들이군요 
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:28	Ohh.
		 
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:36	Ohh.
		 
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	 
		 
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:14	Got it.
		됐어 
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:22	Okay. Me and Vinnie will follow
		right behind you in the car.
		나랑 빈스가 바로 뒤에 붙어 갈게요 
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	You have the keys?
		열쇠 가졌어? 
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:26	- Yep.
		- All right.
		 
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	We get separated, we meet
		at the truck stop at I-90, okay?
		나눠타고 주간고속도로 휴게소에서
		만나는 걸로, 알았지? 
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	Oh, don't worry.
		We won't get separated.
		걱정마요, 반드시 따라갈테니 
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	Well done, men.
		잘했어, 이 친구야 
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	We did it. Congratulations.
		우리가 해냈어, 축하해 
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	Okay.
		 
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	Nicely done.
		멋지게 해줬어 
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	Hey. Don't stick around.
		여기서 너무 머물지 마 
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:39	CBI's gonna be crawling
		all over the place very soon.
		CBI들이 금방 이 일대 깔릴테니까 
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:43	Why'd he have to hug me, man?
		I hate that.
		도대체 사람을 왜 껴안는거야?
		기분 나쁘게 
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:45	Who cares, bro? We're rich.
		그게 무슨 상관이야? 우린 이제 부자라고 
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:51	Open the car. Let's go.
		차 문 열어, 가자 
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	He took the keys.
		저 놈이 열쇠를 가져갔어 
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:55	Bastard took the keys!
		제길, 그 자식이 열쇠를 가져갔어! 
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:58	That's not the worst of it.
		최악은 여기 있지 
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:00	Let me see your hands.
		두 손을 머리 위로 올려라,
		당신들을 체포한다 
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:12	Heads up. Here they come.
		녀석들이군 
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:32	Holly?
		홀리? 
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:33	Whoa...
		Stop right there, Jack.
		움직이지 마, 잭 
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:35	Trish?
		트리시? 
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	Turn around... slowly.
		천천히 돌아서 
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:41	Open the back of the truck.
		차 뒷문 열어 
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:42	Trish, what are you doing?
		트리시, 뭐하는 거야? 
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	Open it.
		Let me see the money.
		열어서 돈을 보여줘 
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:52	The money's in the box.
		돈은 상자 안에 있어 
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	It's gonna be all right, Holly.
		It's gonna be all right.
		괜찮을거야, 홀리. 괜찮을거야 
00:37:59	 
		 
00:37:59	Yeah, sure it is.
		Get over there. Line up. Move.
		그러시겠지, 옆으로 나란히 서 
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:06	Trish, you don't
		have to do this.
		트리시, 이럴건 없잖아 
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	He's right, you know.
		You don't have to kill us.
		그 말이 맞아요, 우릴 죽일건 없잖아요 
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	You're right. I don't,
		but it's cleaner this way.
		그럴 필요야 없지만 이 편이 깔끔해 
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	Everybody who can identify me
		will be dead,
		내 얼굴을 본 자는 다 죽어야 해 
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:17	and I will be on my way
		to Mexico with a boxful of cash.
		그리고 난 상자 가득한 현금을 들고
		멕시코로 튀는거지 
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:20	Drop the gun
		and put your hands in the air!
		총 내려놓고 두 손 머리 위로 들엇! 
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:29	Blammo.
		놀랬지 
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	Ballistics checks out
		for the gun, Trish.
		탄도 분석 결과가 일치하는군요 
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	Tell us why you did it,
		동기가 뭐죠? 
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	and we'll ask the D.A. to take
		the death penalty off the table.
		검사와 얘기해 사형을 면할 수 있나 
		살펴보죠 
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	What do you mean,
		"Why did I do it"?
		동기가 뭐냐구요? 
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	For the money, of course.
		I was robbing a casino.
		물론 돈이죠, 난 카지노를 털었다고 
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:45	Okay.
		좋아요 
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	You think I was bitter
		because Jack was seeing
		잭이 엉덩이 가벼운 웨이트리스년과 
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	some cheap-ass waitress
		instead of me?
		사귀어 내가 상심이라도 했을까봐? 
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:53	You're 100% wrong.
		Couldn't care less.
		그런건 신경도 안 썼어요
