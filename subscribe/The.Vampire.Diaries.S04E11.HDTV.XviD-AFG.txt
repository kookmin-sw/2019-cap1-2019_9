00:06:41	The cure is buried with Silas,

00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	that he gave away that he has on

00:06:52	I see. You want to
		steal it.
		그걸 훔치고 싶구나
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	Yes. And then team Shane will
		have to join team Rebekah,

		예전처럼
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:10	 
		눈만 감았다고 해서
		명상을 하는건 아니야

		이젠 명상도 제대로

00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	Bonnie, you didn't fail.

00:07:26	Exactly. Almost.
		그래, 안죽었자나

00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	Sorry about the mess.
		지저분한건 미안해
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:06	It was a little crowded
		when I arrived,
		도착했을때 좀
		복잡했었어
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	and I prefer more
		intimate gatherings.
		난 사적인 모임을
		더 좋아하거든
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	We 3 need to have
		a little chat.
		우리 3명은

		얜 어리고
		난 네가 싫어

		그러니 본론만 말해

00:10:29	My brother bragged
		about his plan
		형이 제레미의 표식을

		그건 늙다리도
		마찬가지야
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	Why? What's it to you
		either way?
		왜? 너한테 득이
		되는게 뭔데?
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	Because, you fools, in your
		zeal to find the cure,
		치료제를 찾으려는
		너희 멍청이들이
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	you risk waking someone
		very dangerous.

		깨우려고 하니까
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Oh. You must be talking
		about Silas.
		아, 사일러스
		말하는구나
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	What do you know of him?
		그에 대해
		아는게 뭐야?

		Not our problem.
		아무것도, 알고싶지도 않고
		우리 문제가 아니거든
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	Isn't it?
		그럴까?
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	A few hundred years back,
		I came across a group
		몇백년전에 사일러스를
		숭배하는 그룹과 만났었어
00:10:59	 
		몇백년전에 사일러스를
		숭배하는 그룹과 만났었어
00:10:59	that worshiped Silas.
		몇백년전에 사일러스를
		숭배하는 그룹과 만났었어
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	His followers told me
		that he would rise again,
		추종자들이 말하길
		그는 부활할것이고
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	 
		부활하면 종말을
		일으킨다고 했어
00:11:03	and when he did, he would
		trigger the end of all time.
		부활하면 종말을
		일으킨다고 했어
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	You know, being an immortal,
		you can see why I'm opposed
		불멸의 존재인,
		넌 이해가 될거야
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:07	to time's ending.
		왜 내가 종말에
		반대하는지
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	I murdered all of them,
		추종자들을
		전부 죽였는데
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	and now here you are
		willing to risk raising him
		이젠 너희들이
		치료제를 찾으려고
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	in your search for the cure.
		위험을 무릅쓰고
		그를 부활시키려고 하는구나
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	I can't exactly sit back
		and let that happen, can I?
		그렇게 되게
		내가 놔둘것 같아?
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	We're not gonna back off the
		cure because you were told
		멍청이가 무서운 얘기 좀
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	one too many scary
		bedtime stories, you idiot.
		들었다고 해서
		물러서지 않을거야

		mates in Colorado.
		제레미, 콜로라도에서
		우리 친구였자나

00:11:26	You're a smart lad.

00:11:27	Why don't you call off this
		imbecilic treasure hunt?
		같잖은 보물찾기는
		그만두지 않을래?
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	I'm not calling
		anything off, mate.
		취소따윈 안해, 친구야
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:35	Well, I could kill you,
		죽일수도 있지만
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	but then I'd have to deal
		with the hunter's curse,
		그럼 헌터의 저주에
		걸리게 되자나
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	and I... I don't particularly
		feel like being haunted
		게다가 백년동안이나
		유령에 쫓기는건
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	for the next century.

		do the trick.
		이걸로 속임수를
		부린거구나
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	Exactly what you need.

00:12:33	Not interested.
		관심없어

00:12:35	What happened to you? You were
		so much fun in the twenties.
		왜그래? 20년대에는
		정말 재밌었는데
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	I was a psychotic killer with
		no emotions in the 1920s.
		1920년대에 난 무심한

00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	You may have been a killer,
		살인마였을지도 모르지만

00:12:44	but you were far from
		emotionless, Stefan.
		무심한거랑은
		거리가 멀지
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	You had a blast.
		I know you remember.

		교수는 걱정하지마

		killing a house full of people.
		잘은 모르지만 목사에게
		사람을 죽이라고 말했다
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	It doesn't make any sense.
		말이 안되요
00:13:49	It doesn't make any sense.
		 
00:13:49	It doesn't make any sense.
		이런 사람을 겪어봤어
00:13:49	 
		이런 사람을 겪어봤어
00:13:49	I've met people
		like this, Bonnie.
		이런 사람을 겪어봤어
00:13:50	I've met people
		like this, Bonnie.
		 
00:13:50	I've met people
		like this, Bonnie.
		말을 유창하게 하고
		멋있고 사람을 조종해
00:13:51	 
		말을 유창하게 하고
		멋있고 사람을 조종해
00:13:51	They're fast-talking, they're
		charismatic, they're manipulators.
		말을 유창하게 하고
		멋있고 사람을 조종해
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	They prey
		on the weak-minded.
		마음이 약한 사람을
		먹이로 삼지
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	Mmm. And you're worried
		that's what he's doing to me.
		그래서 나한테도
		그랬을까봐 걱정하는거죠
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	That's why you brought
		him in, isn't it?
		그것땜에 불러들인거죠?
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	No. We brought him in because
		April young told us what he did.
		아니, 에이프릴이
		그가 했다고 말해서야
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	Rebekah Mikaelson confirmed it.
		레베카 마이클슨이
		확실히해줬어
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	He confessed to her.
		그가 자백했다고
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	I'm going in there.
		저기 들어갈게요
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	Bonnie, no, you're not.
		보니 안돼
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	If he's gonna tell anyone
		what he did, it's me.
		누군가에게 말한다면
		들을사람은 저에요
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	Unless of course you think
		I'm too weak-minded.
		제가 마음약하다고
		생각하지만 않는다면요
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:27	Bonnie, now is not the time.
		보니, 지금은 안돼
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	Let her talk.
		말하게 두세요
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:36	I think your dad's
		confused about the format
		네 아빠는 학부모
		상담시간이랑
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:37	of the parent-teacher
		conference.
		헷갈려 하는것 같은데
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	I'm so sorry.
		죄송해요
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	Rebekah told them
		you confessed.
		레베카가 교수님이
		자백했다고 말했대요
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	I know she's lying.
		거짓말인거 알아요
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:47	You know, the truth is,
		she's not.
		사실은 거짓말이 아니야
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:57	I'm so sorry. Listen.
		정말 미안해
00:14:58	I'm so sorry. Listen.
		 
00:14:58	I'm so sorry. Listen.
		제레미를 봐달라고
		했을때 난 생각지도...
00:14:59	 
		제레미를 봐달라고
		했을때 난 생각지도...
00:14:59	When I asked you to stay to
		Jeremy, I never thought...
		제레미를 봐달라고
		했을때 난 생각지도...
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	what did you expect, Elena?
		뭘 기대했어, 엘레나?
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	It's Damon.
		데이먼이라구
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	I never wanted
		anyone to get hurt.
		누가 다칠줄은 몰랐어
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Well, then you shouldn't
		have left him in charge.
		그럼 데이먼 책임하에
		두지 말았어야지
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:11	Look. I'm sorry. I know you
		didn't have a choice...
		미안해 너한텐
		선택의 여지가 없었을테니
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	sire bond and all.
		주종관계니까
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	Sire bond doesn't
		work like that.
		주종관계는
		그런식이 아냐
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	All I know, Elena,
		is that the old you
		내가 알았던 너는
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	would have never left
		Jeremy with Damon,
		제레미를 데이먼과 두고
		떠나지 않는다는 거야
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	especially after
		what happened last night.
		게다가 어젯밤
		일도 있었는데
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	[Cell phone rings]
		 
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:30	Jeremy?
		제레미?
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	Jeremy: Elena,
		we're in trouble.
		엘레나 문제가 생겼어
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
		Slow down.
		천천히 말해봐
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	Where's Damon?
		데이먼은 어딨어?
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	Listen to me.
		Kol attacked us.
		들어봐
		콜이 공격했어
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	I barely got away,
		but he's got Damon.
		난 겨우 도망쳤는데
		데이먼은 붙잡혔어
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	A bit ironic you
		coming to me for help.
		나한테 도움을 청하다니
		좀 아이러니한데
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	Weren't your friends just trying
		to bury me in a cement tomb?
		네 친구들이 날 시멘트
		무덤에 묻으려고 하지 않았나?
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	This is your fault.
		이건 당신 잘못이에요
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	You started this when you forced
		Jeremy to kill those vampires.
		제레미보고 그 뱀파이어를
		죽이라고 강요한건 당신이자나요
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	And my little brat of a brother
		has gone and made things worse.
		그래서 내 동생이 가서
		일을 심각하게 만들었구나
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	Well, he never did like Damon.
		콜은 데이먼을
		좋아한적이 없었지
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	I suppose I should do
		something, shouldn't I?
		내가 뭔가 하기를
		바라는것 같은데?
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	Call him off, Klaus.
		콜을 불러들여요, 클라우스
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	You are in no position
		to make demands, love.
		넌 요구를 할
		자격이 없어, 러브
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	Whilst I'd like to cure you
		to make more hybrids,
		널 치료해서 하이브리드를
		많이 만들고 싶기도 하고
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	I do have other reasons
		for finding the cure,
		치료제를 찾는
		다른 이유도 있어
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	not the least of which
		is destroying it
		치료제가 파괴되는걸
		막기 위해서지
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	so you lot can't
		use it against me.
		그러니 나한테 불리하게
		치료제를 이용하진 못해
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	Whatever our differences,
		이유야 다르다해도
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	we want the same thing.
		우린 같은걸
		원하자나요
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	Please. Klaus,
		I'm begging you.
		제발 클라우스
		내가 빌게요
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:41	Little brother.
		동생아
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	Just two days home, and I'm
		told you've already gone
		이틀안에 집에와
		네가 가서
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	and made a mess.
		엉망으로 만들었다고
		들었어
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	Come on, Nik. I was
		only having some fun.
		왜그래 닉
		그냥 재미 좀 본건데
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	Those vampires were
		for my hunter.
		그 뱀파이어들은
		헌터를 위한거였어
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	I'll make some more. There's
		no shortage of people.
		내가 더 만들게
		사람이 부족하진 않자나
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	Where's Damon Salvatore.
		데이먼 살바토어는
		어딨어?
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	I gave him a good
		and proper beating
		내가 적당히
		두들겨 패줬어
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	just for old time's sake.
		옛정을 생각해서
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	Yes. Well, you've had
		your fun.
		그래 재미봤으니까
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Now let him go and come home.
		데이먼 놔주고 집에와
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	Avoid any more trouble, or you'll
		find yourself back in a box.
		문제 일으키지 말고
		안그러면 관에 들어갈줄알아
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	Hey. No need to be
		nasty about it.
		형 끔찍하게
		그럴필요는 없자나
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	On the contrary, I find
		nastiness to be essential
		아니지, 끔찍한건
		필수더라구
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	whenever my siblings
		try to sabotage me.
		내 형제가 날
		방해할땐 말이야
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	Listen closely, Kol.
		잘 들어, 콜
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	Stay away from the Gilbert boy.
		길버트 소년 건들지마
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	Understand?
		알아들었어?
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Fine.
		I won't touch him.
		알았어
		난 안건들게
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	You have my word.
		약속해
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:30	Very good, darling.
		잘했어, 자기야
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	Now stab yourself
		a little bit further.
		이제 조금더 찔러봐
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:36	[Groaning]
		 
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:40	If you're gonna kill me,
		do it like a man.
		날 죽일거라면
		남자답게 해
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	I don't want to kill you.
		안죽일거야
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	I just wanted to make sure
		you could be compelled.
		네가 주술에 걸렸는지
		확실하게 하고 싶은거야
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	I'm gonna rip out your spleen.
		네 비장을 뜯어낼거야
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	You ought to be thanking me.
		넌 나한테
		고마워해야되
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	You don't really want
		the cure found.
		정말로 치료제를
		찾고 싶은게 아니자나
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	You fancy Elena. I mean, even
		more now that she's a vampire.
		엘레나를 좋아하자나
		뱀파이어인 지금은 더 그렇겠지
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	Admit it.
		인정해
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	The last vestige
		of her humanity
		엘레나의 마지막 남은
		인간적인 면은
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	is her annoying
		little brother Jeremy,
		짜증나는
		동생 제레미야
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	and deep, deep down, I bet you
		want him dead, don't you?
		마음 깊숙한 곳에서는
		너도 죽이고 싶어하자나, 그치?
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	Nope.
		아니
00:18:12	Nope.
		 
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	You're lying.
		거짓말 하는구나
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	I bet you'd love to rip
		his head right off...
		제레미 머리를 뽑고
		싶어한다고 장담하지
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:20	And I'm gonna give
		you your wish.
		내가 네 소망을
		들어줄게
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:27	You're not gonna
		remember what I say,
		내가 말한걸
		기억하진 못할거야
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	but you're going to
		find Jeremy Gilbert,
		제레미 길버트를
		찾으러 가
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	and when you do,
		그리고 찾으면
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	you're going to kill him.
		넌 제레미를 죽일거야
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:45	Jeremy, it's over.
		제레미 끝났어
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	You can put all this away.
		이것들은 치워도 되
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	Klaus still wants me
		to finish the mark.
		클라우스는 아직도
		표식을 완성하고 싶어해
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	He's not gonna stop.
		그만두지 않을거야
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	Ok. Well, Damon's
		gonna be back soon,
		알았어, 데이먼이
		곧 돌아오니까
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	and then we can figure
		something out.
		그때 같이 고민해보자
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	Seriously?
		You still trust Damon?
		진심이야?
		아직도 데이먼을 믿어?
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	He saved your life.
		네 목숨을 구했자나
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	He saved the map to the cure.
		치료제를 얻으려고
		지도를 구한거야
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	He couldn't care less about me.
		난 조금도 걱정하지 않아
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	I care about you.
		난 걱정해
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	Don't.
		하지마
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Whatever's inside of me
		that makes me want to hunt,
		내 안에 무언가가
		사냥을 하고 싶게 만들어
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	right now it's on overdrive.
		지금은 더 그래
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:09	Jeremy.
		제레미
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:16	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	I know what I have
		to do, Elena.
		뭘 해야되는지
		잘 알아, 엘레나
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	I really want to get
		that cure for you,
		누나를 위해
		치료제를 찾고 싶어
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	but...
		그런데...
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	I just... I don't how
		I'm gonna do this.
		단지...어떻게
		할지 모르겠어
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:34	[Sighs]
		 
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	So much random crap in here.
		쓸모없는 쓰레기들
		엄청 많네
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	Crap, maybe.
		Random, no.
		쓰레기는 맞아도
		쓸모없지는 않아
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	Looks like Shane has
		a bit of an afterlife fetish.
		쉐인은 사후세계에
		집착이 심했나봐
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	Hopi prayer feathers, the
		han dynasty soul vase,
		호피족 염원 깃털
		한왕조 영혼 꽃병
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	and that is a polynesian
		sacrificial knife.
		그건 폴리네시아
		제물용 칼이야
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	Brutal way to die, but at
		least you appease the gods.
		죽이는건 잔인하지만
		적어도 신은 달랠수 있었으니까
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	Since when did you become
		such an artifact expert?
		언제부터 유물
		전문가가 된거야?
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	I enjoy other cultures, Stefan.
		다른 문화에
		관심이 많아 스테판
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	I know that might be hard
		for you to understand
		네가 이해하기
		힘들거란거 알아
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	considering you dated a child
		who only thinks about herself.
		너랑 데이트한건
		자기만 아는 어린애였으니까
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:08	Still a sensitive
		subject, I see.
		여전히 예민한
		사람이야
00:20:11	Still a sensitive
		subject, I see.
		 
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	Do you know why I wouldn't
		compel Elena from your memory?
		내가 왜 엘레나를
		지우지 않은 줄 알아?
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	Because you wanted me
		to suffer.
		내가 고통스럽길
		바랬으니까
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	I did. It's the only
		way you'll learn.
		그랬지,
		그래야 배우거든
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	It took me a thousand years
		난 천년이나 걸렸어
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	and hundreds of betrayals
		to realize
		수백번의 배반을
		당하고 깨달았어
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	that love, caring ruins you.
		사랑, 배려심은
		사람을 망치는거야
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	Hmm.
		 
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	That's awfully bleak.
		정말 암울하네
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	Quite the opposite.
		그렇지 않아
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	It's liberating actually.
		자유롭게 해줘
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	You know why we had so much
		fun in the twenties, Stefan?
		20년대에는 왜 그렇게
		재밌었는줄 알아?
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:41	Because we didn't care.
		걱정하지 않아서야
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	We just did what felt good...
		마음가는대로 했자나
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	drinking, feeding, sex.
		마시고, 먹고, 섹스하고
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	The sex wasn't good
		because we didn't care.
		걱정없어서 섹스가

00:30:29	Do it.
		어서 해
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:31	Do it!
		하라고
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:44	Ow.
		 
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	Ugh.
		 
00:30:47	 
		 
00:30:51	[Groaning]
		 
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:59	He shot me in the head.
		머리에 쐈네
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	Stupid idiot...
		멍청한 놈
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	Borderline brain-dead moron!
		말 안듣는 멍청한 놈
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:15	That was dumb, Jeremy.
		바보 같았어 제레미
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	Eh.
		 
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	Should have killed me
		when you had the chance.
		기회가 있을때
		날 죽였어야지
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:33	Going somewhere?
		어디 가나봐?
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:34	I would if I were you.
		내가 너라면 그럴거야
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	If Damon kills the hunter,
		데이먼이 헌터를
		죽였다면
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	Nik will not be pleased.
		클라우스가 기뻐하진
		않을테니까
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	I told Nik I wouldn't
		touch the kid.
		난 안건들거라고 말했어
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	I didn't.
		안건들였어
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	Oh. Well,
		that was clever.
		기발했어
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	I'm sure he'll really
		appreciate it.
		아주 고마워 할거야
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:50	You'd really dagger me?
		정말로 날 찌를려고?
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	If I do, Damon's compulsion
		ends and this is all over.
		그런다면 데이먼은 주술에서
		풀리고 모든게 끝날거야
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	And then you're no
		better than Niklaus.
		그러면 누나도
		클라우스랑 다를게 없어
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	Daggering siblings when
		you disagree with them...
		언쟁할때마다
		형제를 찌르는건...
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	look at what this
		family has become.
		우리 가족이 어찌
		됐는지 생각해봐
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	I mean, Elijah won't
		even show his face
		일라이자는 얼굴도
		보여주지 않으려 하지
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	he's so disgusted
		by our bickering.
		말다툼하는걸
		지극히 싫어했으니까
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:09	This cure has ruined us,
		치료제가 우릴 망쳤어
00:32:11	 
		 
00:32:11	and it hasn't even
		been found yet.
		아직 발견되지도
		않았는데 말이야
00:32:15	 
		 
00:32:15	Just imagine what would
		happen if it is.
		발견되면 무슨 일이
		벌어질지 생각해봐
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	This family was ruined long
		before we knew about the cure.
		이 가족은 치료제를 알기
		오래 전부터 이미 망했어
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:24	Kol!
		콜
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	I won't let you raise Silas.
		사일러스를 부활하게
		놔두지 않을거야
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:28	Enough of this foolishness.
		멍청한짓좀 그만해
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	Put it down, Kol.
		내려놔 콜
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:36	He was going to kill me.
		날 죽이려 했어
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:38	Well, then, I think
		you need a lesson
		그럼 내가
		가르쳐줘야겠네
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	in how to properly
		dagger a sibling.
		올바르게 형제를
		찌르는 방법을 말이야
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:47	Burn in hell.
		지옥에서 타죽어버려
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:58	Unh!
		 
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:11	Damon, stop!
		데이먼 멈춰요
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:16	I know that you don't
		want to hurt Jeremy,
		제레미를 다치게 하고
		싶지 않은거 알아요
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:19	so please stop.
		그러니 제발 그만해요
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:24	I can't.
		불가능해
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:25	Yes, you can.
		아니, 할 수 있어요
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:27	You're strong enough
		to resist the compulsion.
		주술에 저항할만큼
		당신은 강해요
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	I know that you are.
		그렇다는거 알아요
00:33:31	 
		 
00:33:31	Why, because Stefan did?
		왜, 스테판이
		그랬으니까?
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:32	Because I love you,
		because you love me.
		내가 당신을 사랑하고
		당신이 날 사랑하니까요
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:39	You'd do anything for me,
		so please...
		날 위해서 무엇이든
		할거자나요 그러니 제발...
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	Do this for me.
		날 위해서
		그만해요
00:33:45	 
		 
00:34:00	I'm sorry, Elena.
		미안해 엘레나
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:02	Damon!
		데이먼
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:06	Jeremy.
		제레미
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:10	Shoot now.
		지금 쏴
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:13	Hey, brother.
		Long time, no see.
		안녕 형
		오랫만이야
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	[Snap]
		 
00:34:17	 
		 
00:34:25	You're welcome.
		별거 아냐
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:40	[Groans]
		 
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:43	Easy there, buddy.
		진정해
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	You lost a lot of blood.
		피를 많이 흘렸어
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	[Groaning]
		 
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	So you bled me out?
		피를 빼낸거야?
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:54	Yeah. I didn't really
		have much of a choice.
		어, 달리 방법이 없었어
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:56	Kol's compulsion
		is still in effect,
		콜의 주술은 아직도
		영향을 미치니까
00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:58	so you need to stay locked up.
		갇혀있어야되
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:00	We don't have
		any vervain, so...
		마편초도 없으니까
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	This was the only way
		I could weaken you.
		약하게 만들려면
		이 방법 밖에 없었어
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:05	You sound
		real torn up about it.
		정말로 슬퍼하는 것처럼
		들리네
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	Shouldn't we be going
		after Kol,
		콜한테 가서
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	make him decompel me.
		주술을 풀어야
		되는거 아니야?
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:14	Yeah, yeah, sure. That
		sounds easy enough, Damon.
		그래 그럴게
		그건 하기 쉽겠어
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	I'll get right on that.
		그렇게 할게
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	[Music playing]
		 
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	[Coughs]
		 
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	At least let me see Elena.
		엘레나는 보게 해줘
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	Come on. You know
		you can't do that.
		안돼는거 형도 알자나
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	With the sire bond,
		all you have to do
		주종관계때문에
		내보내달라고
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	is tell her to
		let you out of here.
		말만하면 되는거자나
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:30	It's too risky.
		너무 위험해
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	You're really enjoying
		this, aren't you?
		너 재밌지, 그렇지?
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:34	It's better for Elena if
		you stay in here for now,
		형이 여기 있으면
		엘레나한테도 좋아
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:36	at least until we
		find the cure,
		적어도 치료제를
		찾을때까지는
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:38	and then once she's
		no longer sired
		그리고나서 엘레나가
		복종하지 않고
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	and you're no longer compelled,
		형도 주술에서 풀리면
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:43	you can both do whatever
		the hell you want.
		둘이서 하고싶은거
		마음대로 해
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	Stefan, wait. Stefan!
		스테판, 잠깐만 스테판

00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	Stef...
		스테...
00:35:55	 
		 
00:36:08	Going to see Damon?
		데이먼 보러가?
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:09	I need to talk to him.
		할말이 있어
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:11	Well, you can't. He'll just
		ask you to let him out.
		안돼
		꺼내달라고 할거야
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	I won't let him out.
		풀어주지 않아
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:15	You won't have a choice.
		선택할 수 있는게
		아니자나
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	You're sired.
		복종하자나
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:23	That all?
		그게 다야?
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	Stefan, what are you
		doing with Rebekah?
		스테판, 레베카랑은
		뭐하는 거야?
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	She tried to kill me.
		날 죽이려고 했어
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	And this will be
		the second time that
		이번이 두번째로
00:36:31	 
		이번이 두번째로
00:36:31	Damon tried to kill Jeremy.
		이번이 두번째로
00:36:31	Damon tried to kill Jeremy.
		 
00:36:31	Damon tried to kill Jeremy.
		데이먼이 제레미를
		죽이려 한거자나
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	So I guess nobody's
		perfect, right?
		완벽한 사람은
		아무도 없나봐, 그치?
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:39	Are you trying to punish me?
		왜 그렇게
		못되게 굴어?
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	I don't know how many times
		I can apologize.
		몇 번이나 더 사과해야
		되는지 모르겠네
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	I never asked you to.
		그러라고 한적없어
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	You can do whatever
		you want, Elena.
		네가 하고싶은대로 해
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:47	I really don't care.
		진짜로 관심없어
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:54	You're hurt.
		You're hurt,
		가슴아프구나
		가슴아파해
00:36:57	 
		가슴아프구나
		가슴아파해
00:36:57	and you're acting out, Stefan.
		가슴아프구나
		가슴아파해
00:36:57	and you're acting out, Stefan.
		 
00:36:57	and you're acting out, Stefan.
		그래서 이러는거지, 스테판
00:36:59	 
		 
00:36:59	This isn't you.
		이건 너가 아니야
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:00	Sure it is.
		맞아
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:02	You've just never
		seen me like this.
		내가 이러는걸
		본적이 없어서 그래
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:07	You don't know what I look like
		널 사랑하지 않을때는
		내가 어떤지 모르자나

		널 사랑하지 않을때는
		내가 어떤지 모르자나
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:18	I'll let Damon know
		you stopped by.
		들렸다고
		데이먼한테 말할게
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:36	I owe you an apology.
		죄송해요
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	You don't owe me anything.
		그럴 필요없다
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:41	I'm not happy to be right.
		차라리 내가
		틀렸으면 좋겠어
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:45	I'm gonna get you some help.
		넌 도움이 필요해
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	Help? Dad, I'm ok.
		도움이요?
		전 괜찮아요
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	Are you kidding me?
		장난하니?
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:51	I got angry I admit,
		화난거는
		인정할게요
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	but I knew what I was doing.
		내가 뭘 하는진
		알고 있었어요
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	You lost control,
		and Shane said...
		자제력을 잃었어
		그리고 쉐인이...
00:37:59	 
		 
00:37:59	didn't we just establish
		that we couldn't trust him?
		쉐인은 믿을수 없는
		사람인거 알잖아요?
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:03	He's trying to get
		under your skin.
		그렇게 생각하게
		하려고 그러는거에요
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	The only thing that got under
		my skin is what I saw,
		내가 그렇게 생각하는건
		내가 본 것 때문이야
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:07	which is my daughter
		using dangerous magic!
		내 딸이 위험한
		마법을 사용했자나
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	And the fact that you
		don't think you need help
		도움이 필요하지
		않다는 생각자체가
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:12	means you need it even more.
		더욱더 도움이
		필요하다는거야
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:29	Good evening, Gilbert clan.
		안녕, 길버트 가족
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:31	What do you want, Klaus?
		원하는게 뭐에요,
		클라우스?
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:33	I've come to fetch my hunter.
		헌터를 데려가려고
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	Seeing as how my brother's
		become a liability,
		동생이 얼마나
		골칫거리인지 봤자나
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	Jeremy will be safer with me.
		제레미는 나랑 있는게
		더 안전할거야
00:38:39	 
		 
00:38:39	I think I'll pass.
		그건 아닌것 같아요
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:41	I've killed enough
		people for you today.
		당신때문에 오늘은
		이미 사람을 많이 죽였어요
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	You think you're
		safer here? Hmm.
		여기가 안전하다고
		생각해?
00:38:46	 
		 
00:38:46	Clearly you don't know Kol.
		콜에 대해 모르는구만
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	He'll stop at nothing
		to get what he wants,
		원하는걸 얻을때까지
		절대로 포기하지 않아
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	so strange as it may seem,
		I'm your best bet.
		이상하겠지만
		내가 가장 안전해
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:51	Sorry, but I think we'd
		rather take our chances.
		미안하지만 우리끼리
		하는게 날것 같아요
00:38:55	 
		 
00:39:00	Fine, but when Kol does come...
		알았어,
		근데 콜이 오면...
00:39:02	 
		 
00:39:02	and he will come...
		분명히 올거야...
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:04	be sure to let me know,
		나한테 꼭 말해
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:06	preferably before he burns
		your nice little home
		 
00:39:07	preferably before he burns
		your nice little home
		집이 다타기 전에
		말해주면 좋겠어
00:39:09	 
		집이 다타기 전에
		말해주면 좋겠어
00:39:09	to the ground.
		집이 다타기 전에
		말해주면 좋겠어
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:12	And as for you, hunter,
		그리고 너, 헌터
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	there's no shortage
		of people to turn
		뱀파이어로 만들
		사람은 부족하지 않아
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	and loved ones to
		threaten, so sleep well.
		네가 사랑하는 사람도
		그렇고, 그러니 잘자
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	We'll plan on finishing

		이걸 끝낼 계획은
		내일 생각하자
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:36	[Door opens]
		 
00:39:39	 
		 
00:39:39	Sure. Just barge
		right in.
		당연하게 그냥 들어오네
00:39:41	 
		 
00:39:41	Oh. I thought not
		knocking was our thing.
		노크 안하는게
		우리방식인줄 알았는데
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:45	You didn't dagger Kol.
		콜을 찌르지 않았구나
00:39:46	 
		 
00:39:46	Well, the white oak stake
		pointed at my heart
		하얀 오크 말뚝을
		내 심장에 겨누는데
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:49	made things a little difficult.
		좀 힘들었어
00:39:51	 
		 
00:39:51	I do believe my brother Kol
		has finally lost his mind.
		콜이 드디어
		미친게 확실해
00:39:55	 
		 
00:39:55	That's all right.
		Jeremy's still alive,
		괜찮아
		제레미도 살아있고
00:39:57	 
		 
00:39:57	and I took care of Damon.
		데이먼은 내가
		데리고 있으니까
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:00	So where'd you put it?
		그건 어디다 뒀어?
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:04	The headstone?
		Mm-hmm.
		-묘비?
		-응
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	Some place safe.
		안전한곳에
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:07	Wasn't really our deal.
		그러기로 한건
		아니자나
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:08	Well, considering that
		you've betrayed me twice
		두번이나 날
		배신한걸로 볼때
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	and I've betrayed you never,
		난 한번도
		배반하지 않았지
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	I think I'm acting brilliantly,
		좀 더 뛰어나게
		생각해야겠더라구
00:40:15	 
		 
00:40:15	especially since we have no idea
		why that guy was looking for it.
		게다가 그놈이 그걸 왜
		찾았는지 이유도 모르니까
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:20	Did you work things out
		with Elena?
		엘레나랑은 해결봤어?
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:22	Do you care?
		신경쓰여?
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:24	Nope. Just trying to figure
		out why you're here.
		아니, 그냥 네가
		여기 왜 왔는가 해서
00:40:27	 
		 
00:40:27	Do you even have to ask?
		물어볼 필요가 있을까?
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:32	No feelings, no attachments.
		애정도 갖지말고,
		미련도 갖지마
00:40:36	 
		 
00:40:36	None...
		아무것도...
00:40:39	 
		 
00:40:39	Whatsoever.
		하나도 없어
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:52	This is never gonna end.
		절대로 끝이 안날거야
00:40:55	 
		 
00:40:55	If Kol doesn't kill me first,
		콜이 날 먼저
		죽이지 않으면
00:40:56	 
		 
00:40:56	then Klaus is just gonna force
		me to kill more innocent people.
		클라우스가 무고한
		사람을 더 죽이게 할거야
00:40:59	 
		 
00:40:59	How many is it
		gonna take, 10, 100?
		몇명이나 죽여야 되는데
		10명, 100명?
00:41:03	 
		 
00:41:07	If you kill one
		original vampire,
		오리지날 뱀파이어
		한명만 죽이면
00:41:10	 
		 
00:41:10	their entire sire line
		will die with them.
		콜이 만든 뱀파이어가
		전부 죽을거야
00:41:13	 
		 
00:41:13	That's thousands,
		수천명일거야
00:41:14	 
		 
00:41:14	maybe tens of thousands
		of vampires.
		어쩌면 수 천
		수 만명일지도
00:41:19	 
		 
00:41:19	Kol compelled Damon
		to kill you.
		콜은 널 죽이라고
		데이먼을 시켰자나
00:41:22	 
		 
00:41:22	You're gonna kill Kol instead.
		대신에 넌 콜을
		죽이는거야
00:41:25
