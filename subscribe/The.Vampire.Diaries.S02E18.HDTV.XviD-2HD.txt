		뱀파이어 다이어리
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	- You must be Elena.
		- How do we look exactly alike?
		- 네가 엘레나구나
		- 어떻게 이렇게 닮았죠?
00:00:03	You're a Petrova
		doppelganger.
		넌 페트로바의 도플갱어야
00:00:03	You're a Petrova
		doppelganger.
		 
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	You're the key
		to breaking the curse.
		저주를 푸는 열쇠지
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	- The Sun and the Moon curse?
		- Klaus is the real deal.
		- 해와 달의 저주요?
		- 클라우스는 엄청난 존재야
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	From the first
		generation of vampires.
		1세대 뱀파이어지
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:10	The oldest vampire in the history
		of time is coming after me?
		역사상 가장 오래된 뱀파이어가
		날 뒤쫓고 있다구요?
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	- Elijah.
		- One of the Originals.
		- 일라이자
		- 원조 뱀파이어중 하나야
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	- He's a legend.
		- Aah!
		전설이지
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	So that's it. As long as we keep the
		dagger in there, then he stays dead.
		끝이야. 단도를 빼지만 않으면
		그대로 죽은 상태지
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Elijah had no weapon
		to kill Klaus.
		일라이자는 클라우스를 죽일
		무기가 없었어
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:22	But he believed that if a witch
		could channel enough power,
		하지만 마녀가 충분한 힘을
		끌어 모으면
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	it wouldn't need one.
		무기가 필요없으리라 믿었지
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:26	Like the power
		you get from a spot
		몇 백 명의 마녀가
		죽은 장소로 부터
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	marked with
		a hundred dead witches.
		끌어모을 수 있는
		에너지처럼
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Says if you use too much of your
		powers at once, it'll kill you.
		한번에 너무 많은
		힘을 쓰면 죽을 수 있대
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	How much would it take
		to kill an Original?
		원조 뱀파이어를 죽이려면
		얼마나 많은 힘이 들어?
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	All of it.
		모든 힘을 다 써야해
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	I'm a vampire.
		난 뱀파이어야
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	- I don't want to know this!
		- Tell me what I can do.
		- 알고 싶지 않아!
		- 뭘 해야할지 알려줘
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	I drank that vervain stuff and
		then asked her to take it away.
		마편초 탄 걸 마셨고
		기억을 앗아달라 부탁했어요
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:40	I want you to tell me
		everything she said.
		캐롤라인이 말한걸
		다 말해주렴
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:42	I found my way to someone
		in his trusted circle.
		하지만 내부 사람 중
		한명과 접촉할 방법을 찾았지
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	One of Klaus' witches.
		클라우스의 마녀 중 하나
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:47	He's all yours.
		마음대로 하세요
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:50	I have Katherine
		and the moonstone.
		캐더린과 월장석을 갖고 있다
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:52	Klaus has everything
		he needs for now.
		클라우스님은
		당장 필요한걸 갖췄어
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:55	Alaric?
		알라릭?
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:59	Katerina, I've missed you.
		캐터리나, 그 동안 보고 싶었어
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:02	Klaus!
		클라우스!

00:01:14	Ok, bad,

00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:16	or badder?
		이제 더 구려?
00:01:17	 
		 
00:01:17	The dark colors
		suit you better.
		어두운 색이
		더 잘 어울려요
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:20	Oh, thank you,
		honey.
		고마워, 자기야
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:21	Ok, pop quiz.
		깜짝 퀴즈
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	The dagger and white ash are in the
		Salvatores possession, correct?
		단도와 하얀 재는
		살바토어 형제가 갖고 있지?
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:26	The dagger was used
		to kill Elijah.
		단도는 일라이자를
		죽이는데 쓰였어요
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	You'll find him in the basement
		of the Salvatore house.
		살바토어가 지하실에서
		찾을 수 있을거에요
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:31	Ok, that dagger needs to
		stay exactly where it is.
		단도는 그 위치에
		있어야 해
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	The last thing I need to
		do is resurrect Elijah.
		일라이자는 절대
		부활시키고 싶지 않거든
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	Ohh, that guy
		is a buzz kill.
		그 자식이
		분위기를 확 깼다니까
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	Don't forget you're on the outs
		with your girlfriend Jenna.
		제나와 사귀는 사이인거
		잊지 마세요
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	Right. Elena's aunt.
		For all the lies about Isobel.
		맞다. 엘레나 이모
		이자벨에 관한 걸 숨기고
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:45	- What else?
		- That's it.
		- 또 뭐가 있지?
		- 그게 다에요
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:50	Oh, so jumpy.
		겁내지 마
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	Please, just... kill me.
		제발, 그냥 죽여주세요
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	I've told you everything
		that I know.
		아는 건 다 말해줬어요
00:01:58	 
		 
00:01:58	Hmm.
		흠
00:01:59	 
		 
00:02:00	You see, I believe
		that you believe that.
		그걸 믿는다는 걸
		나도 믿겠어
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	But what would you
		not know?
		하지만 모르는게
		뭐가 있을까?
00:02:07	 
		 
00:02:07	What could they be
		keeping from you? Hmm?
		그들이 너한테서
		숨기고 있는게 뭘까?
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	Anything?
		아무 거라도?
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:14	Tell me.
		말해봐
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	They were trying to see
		if Bonnie could find a way
		지금 그들은
		원조 뱀파이어를
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:20	to kill an Original
		without a dagger.
		단도 없이 죽일 방법을
		찾고 있어요
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:22	Bonnie the best friend?
		단짝친구 보니?
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:26	And then you said she didn't
		have her powers anymore.
		능력을 잃었댔잖아
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:28	She doesn't.
		지금은 아녜요
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:29	Or didn't. I don't know.
		과거에 그랬던건가
		잘 모르겠어요
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	You kidnapped me, remember?
		I'm kinda out of the loop.
		날 납치한거 기억 안나요?
		한동안 소식을 몰랐어요
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:33	Well, we'll have to get
		to the bottom of that.
		그럼 그건
		직접 파악해보도록 하지
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:36	Please, just kill me, Klaus,
		and be done with it.
		제발 날 죽여요, 클라우스
		그냥 끝내라고요
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	And show you kindness?
		네게 친절을 베풀라고?
00:02:42	 
		 
00:02:42	I've searched for you
		for over 500 years.
		난 널 찾기 위해
		500년을 보냈어
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:47	Your death
		is going to last
		네 죽음은 최후가 될거야
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	at least half that long.
		최소한 그 정도로
		끌어줘야 하지
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:57	I want you
		to take this knife...
		이 칼을 가지고
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	And stab yourself.
		너 자신을 찌르도록 해
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:14	Now take it out.
		Ahhh!
		이제 빼
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	Now while I'm gone,
		I want you to do that
		이제 내가 간 동안
		바로 그걸
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	over and over
		and over again.
		계속해서 되풀이하거라
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:23	And if you get bored,
		지루해지면
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	switch legs.
		찌르는 다리를 바꿔
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:27	Where are you going?
		어디 가세요?
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	I'm gonna go lay eyes
		난 내 소중한 도플갱어를
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	on my precious
		doppelganger.
		관찰하러 갈거야
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:39	Oh, don't look
		so glum, Katerina.
		우울한 표정 짓지마, 캐더리나
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:44	The fun is just
		beginning.
		재미는 아직
		시작 안됐는걸
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:48	Again, please.
		다시 찔러
00:03:51

		너만의 안전한 피난처가 되는구나
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	That's the idea.
		그렇지
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:14	Wouldn't want
		to clean it.
		청소하기 좀 힘들겠다
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:21	You really think Bonnie
		can take on Klaus?
		보니가 클라우스를
		쓰러뜨릴 수 있다 생각해?
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	She said she could channel enough
		witch's power to kill him.
		마녀들의 힘을 끌어모으면
		죽일 수 있을거랬어
00:04:25	 
		 
00:04:25	Elijah thought that would work
		일라이자도
		그걸 믿었지
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:28	and he was an Original, so.
		원조 뱀파이어니까
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	- We just need to find him.
		- Yeah.
		- 그를 찾아야만 해
		- 응
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:32	Could she do one of those
		witch tracking spells?
		마녀 추적 마법을
		보니도 할 수 있나?
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	Nope. Not without something
		that belongs to Klaus.
		아니. 클라우스 편인 마녀의
		물건이 없이는 안돼
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:38	Believe me,
		I already asked.
		날 믿어봐
		이미 물어봤었어
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Ohh.
		 
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:44	Do you think
		he killed her?
		클라우스가
		그녀를 죽인거 같아?
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:48	Katherine?
		캐더린 말이지?
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	Probably.
		어쩌면
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:55	It's not like she
		didn't have it coming.
		캐더린도 이미
		예견했던 거잖아
00:04:59	 
		 
00:05:00	Yeah.
		그래
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:05	Thank you,
		Mr. Henry.
		고마워요
		헨리씨
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:12	I'm sorry.
		I completely forgot.
		미안해요
		깜박 잊었네
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:16	Stefan.
		스테판
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:18	Would you like to come
		inside my house?
		우리 집으로
		들어오겠어요?
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	I would love to.
		Thank you.
		기꺼이요
		고마워
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	What are we, 12?
		우리 뭐 12살이니?
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	One of us is.
		나 말고 한 명은 그렇죠
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	If I let you in,
		do you promise
		당신을 들이겠다면
		약속해줄래요
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:32	to obey the owner
		of this house?
		이 집 주인의
		명령을 따르겠다고?
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	- No.
		- Seriously, Damon.
		- 아니
		- 진짜, 데이먼
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	My way. You promised.
		I call the shots.
		내 방식대로 하기로 했잖아요
		내 결정에 따르겠다
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	No lies, no secret
		agendas. Remember?
		거짓말이나 비밀은 없기로
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	Yes, Elena. Sure.
		그래
		물론 기억하지
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:46	Then please, come in.
		그럼 제발 들어와요
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:50	Shut up.
		입 다물어
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:54	Thanks.
		고마워
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:55	- Wait, where are you going?
		- To school.
		- 어디 가?
		- 학교에서
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	Huh?
		No, no, no.
		안돼지
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	We didn't create a safe
		house for you to leave it.
		우린 맘대로 나가라고
		은신처를 만들어준게 아냐
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	Yeah, guys,
		Klaus is out there.
		클라우스는
		어딘가 있어요
00:06:03	 
		 
00:06:03	- We know that.
		- Right.
		- 알죠
		- 맞아
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:05	- But where?
		- No one knows.
		- 하지만 어디요?
		- 아무도 모르지
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	Look, I really appreciate
		what you guys are doing.
		둘의 시도는
		정말 고마워요
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	And I'll be able to sleep at night
		knowing that I'll be safe here,
		내가 여기서 안전할거란걸
		알고 잘 수 있어서 좋겠죠
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	but I'm not going
		to be a prisoner.
		하지만 난
		수용소처럼 살지 않을거에요
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:21	Your way, Elena.
		네 방식대로 해, 엘레나
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Don't worry,
		I'm ready.
		걱정마요
		준비 됐어요
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:24	If he shows his face,
		I can take him.
		그가 얼굴을 들어내면
		내가 잡을 거에요
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	Know how.
		노하우를 익혔죠
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	The way I see it,
		next to Bonnie
		내가 보기에
		보니 옆은
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	is the safest place
		that I can be.
		가장 안전한 위치인걸요
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	Come on.
		어서
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:39	Wait, um, coming.
		잠깐만, 간다
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:51	Caroline left early
		for school.
		캐롤라인은
		일찍 등교했다
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	I know.
		I came to see you.
		알아요
		어머님 보러 왔어요
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	I don't know what to do.
		What to say,
		어떻게 해야할지 모르겠어요
		뭐라고 말할지
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	how to act around her.
		어떤 식으로 대할지 말이죠
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	You can't let on
		that you know.
		네가 아는 걸
		드러내면 안된다
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	She wants me to take her to the dance.
		What am I supposed to do?
		무도회에 데려가길 원해요
		어쩌죠?
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:02	Take her to the dance.
		무도회에 데려가렴
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	I'll never get away with it.
		난 맘 편히 못할거에요
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	She knows me too well,
		she'll figure it out.
		날 너무 잘 알아서
		눈치를 챌거라구요
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	Damn it,
		Matt, just do it.
		젠장, 맷
		그냥 같이 가렴
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	She's my daughter.
		She's my baby. I just,
		내 딸이잖니
		내 아이야 난 그저..
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	I need some time.
		I know, but...
		시간이 필요해
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:12	Look, if what Caroline
		told you is true,
		네가 말한 캐롤라인이
		사실이라면
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	she's not
		the only one.
		걔 뿐만이 아냐
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	The Salvatores
		are vampires.
		살바토어 형제도
		뱀파이어야
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	The Gilbert family
		is in on it.
		길버트 가족도 그 편이고
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	Tyler Lockwood
		is God knows what.
		타일러 락우드도
		별종중 하나지
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	A werewolf.
		늑대인간요
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	There's no one in this
		town I can trust.
		이 마을에서
		내가 믿을 사람은 없어
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	I just need
		to take a beat
		난 숨 좀 돌리고
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	and figure out
		what to do.
		어떻게 해야할지
		결정할거야
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	- That'll never fool her.
		- Yes, you will.
		- 그래도 소용 없을거에요
		- 아니, 모르게 될거야
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	As far as she knows, you
		don't remember anything.
		그녀는 네가 아무것도
		기억 못할거라 믿지
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	Buy me some time.
		시간을 좀 벌어주렴
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	Please, Matt.
		제발, 맷
00:07:41	 
		 
00:08:00	Hello, class.
		안녕, 여러분
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	Ahem.
		 
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	What...
		뭘..
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:06	Are we learning today?
		오늘 가르치기로 했죠?
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	With the decade dance
		tonight,
		60년대 테마 무도회 때문에
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	we've been covering
		the sixties all week.
		60년대 역사를
		배우고 있었죠
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	Right.
		맞다
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	The sixties.
		60년대
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:26	The, uh, ahem...
		그러니까..
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	The sixties.
		60년대
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	I wish there was
		something good
		60년대에 관해서
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	I could say
		about the sixties, but...
		좋은 게 있을텐데..
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	Actually, they kind of sucked.
		사실은 엉망인 시대였죠
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	Except for the Beatles,
		of course.
		비틀즈만 빼면요
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	They made it bearable.
		Uh, what else was there?
		견딜 수 있을 정도였죠
		또 뭐가 있더라?
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:43	The Cuban missile thing,
		쿠바 미사일 사건
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	the... we walked on the moon.
		그리고.. 달에 착륙했죠
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	There was Watergate.
		워터게이트 사건도 있었고
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	Watergate was
		the seventies, Ric.
		워터게이트 사건은
		70년대에 났어요, 릭
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:52	I-I mean, Mr. Saltzman.
		그러니까
		살츠만 선생님
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:54	Right.
		맞다
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	It all kind of mushes
		together up here,
		그게 다 그 무렵에 터졌죠
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	the sixties, seventies.
		60년 70년대에
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	Thank you, Elena.
		고마워요, 엘레나
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:12	Hey, Dana.
		Hey.
		데이나
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:16	Um, can you
		take care of these?
		이것 좀 도와줄래?
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	Sure.
		물론
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	Ok, thank you.
		고마워
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:22	Hey.
		 
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:29	What was that for?
		왠일이야?
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	Just practicing for tonight.
		오늘밤 연습 좀 하려고
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	Oh.
		 
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	Mmm.
		 
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	So I... found a suit.
		나.. 양복을 찾았어
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	If you still want me
		to be JFK.
		아직도 존 케네디 역할을 원한다면
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	Perfect.
		완벽해
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:46	Do you think Elena knows
		what it's going to take
		우리 누나도
		클라우스와 싸우려면
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	for you to do
		that Klaus spell?
		얼마나 많은 에너지가
		필요한지 알아?
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	No, and you're not, either.
		아니, 너도 모르고
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Well, she's gotta know
		you can't do it.
		누나도 알게 될거야
		어쩔 수 없지
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	You don't know I can't.
		내가 못하리란 건 너도 몰라
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	Have a little faith in me.
		날 믿어봐
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	That's not fair.
		불공평해
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	You can't harness
		the power
		몇백명의 마녀로 부터
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	of a hundred dead witches.
		It'll kill you.
		힘을 모을 수 없어
		죽게 될거라고
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	Shh! We don't know that
		for certain.
		쉿! 아직 확실히
		모르는 일이잖아
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	You promised to keep my
		secret, I'm trusting you.
		너 비밀 지키기로 약속했지
		널 믿고 있다구
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	I'm going through with this, and
		if you tell anyone, I swear...
		이런 일을 같이 겪는데
		이걸 누구한테 말하면..
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	what? What are you
		gonna do?
		뭐? 어쩔건데?
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:12	Hey, Jer.
		How you doing?
		제레미
		잘 있었니?
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	Are you ok at the house
		alone with John?
		존 삼촌하고 같이
		집에 있는거 괜찮니?
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	It's not ideal.
		별로 좋지는 않지
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:21	You haven't heard
		from Jenna, have you?
		제나 이모 소식 못 들었어?
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	It looks like she's staying on
		campus instead of coming home.
		집에 오는 대신
		학교에 있을 모양인데
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:26	I'm late for class.
		수업 늦겠다
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:31	What's going on?
		무슨 일이야?
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:33	I told him he had to dress up
		tonight and he got all uptight.
		오늘 60년대 복장을 해야된다니까
		부담을 느끼더라고
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	Oh.
		아
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:38	Hey, Elena,
		there you are. Ok.
		엘레나
		여기 있었네
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	This is going to sound freaky,
		조금 소름 끼칠 수 있는데
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:42	but this totally hot guy
		just asked me to ask you
		정말 멋진 남자애가
		너한테 물어보라고 했어
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	if you're going
		to the dance tonight.
		무도회에 같이 갈 수 있는지
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	Tell him she has
		a boyfriend.
		남친 있다고 말해줘
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:49	You could at least meet him.
		He'll be at the dance tonight.
		최소한 만날 수 있잖아
		그도 무도회에 참석할거래
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	Look for him.
		His name is Klaus.
		찾아봐
		이름이 클라우스야
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:55	I'm sorry, what did
		you just say?
		미안한데 방금 뭐라고?
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	His name's Klaus.
		이름이 클라우스야
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	I know the name's stupid,
		but I swear he's hot.
		바보같은 이름이지만
		맹세컨데 섹시해
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	Where is he?
		Is he here?
		어디 있어?
		여기?
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:07	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:11	She's being compelled.
		주문에 걸린거야
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	But he wants to know if you'll
		save him the last dance.
		하지만 마지막 춤은
		자신을 위해 남겨두래
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:15	How cute is that?
		정말 귀엽지 않니?
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:19	So we go to the dance, we find him.
		무도회에 가면
		찾아낼 수 있을거야
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	Really? How are we
		going to do that?
		정말? 어떻게 할건데?
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	We don't even know
		what he looks like.
		어떻게 생겼는지도 모르잖아
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	Something tells me he's not
		going to be 16 and pimply.
		16살 여드름 투성이는
		아닐게 확실해
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:27	He could be anywhere
		at any time.
		어디서 어느때건
		나타날 수 있어
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	He compelled
		somebody at school.
		학생 누군가에게 주문을 걸었는걸
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	I guess it's not as safe
		as you guys thought, huh?
		네 생각처럼
		안전하지 않겠네
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:35	There you are.
		여기 있었네
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:40	Sorry I'm late.
		늦어서 미안하다
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	Hey, I need you
		to put me down
		오늘 저녁 무도회에
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	as a chaperone
		at the dance tonight.
		나도 보호자로 써줘
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	Klaus made his first move.
		클라우스가
		첫 시도를 했어
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	Ok, so we find him
		and then what, hmm?
		찾고 나면 어쩌려고?
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	- What's our plan of attack?
		- Me.
		- 공격 계획은?
		- 나요
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	I'm the plan.
		He has no idea
		내가 그 계획이야
		그는 전혀 몰라
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	how much power
		I can channel.
		내가 얼마나 많은 힘을
		끌어모을 수 있는지
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	If you can find him,
		I can kill him.
		네가 찾으면
		내가 죽일거야
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:00	That's not going
		to be that easy.
		그리 쉽지 않을거야
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	I mean, he is the biggest,
		baddest vampire around.
		가장 크고 무서운
		뱀파이어인걸
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	Alaric has a point.
		I mean, what if he...
		알라릭 말이 일리가 있어
		그러니까 만약에..
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:13	Well, I was impressed.
		놀라운데
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	It doesn't matter
		if he's an Original.
		1세대란 건 중요치 않아
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	I can take down
		anyone who comes at me.
		나한테 달려드는
		누구건 쓰러뜨릴 수 있어
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	I can kill him, Elena.
		죽일거야, 엘레나
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	I know I can.
		내가 할 수 있는걸 알아
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:33	Ah, you're right.
		맞았어
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	This witch is all juiced
		up and aiming to kill.
		그 마녀는 날 죽이려고
		안달이 나있더군
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	That's terrible.
		안됐네요
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	We're gonna have
		to kill her, Maddox.
		그녀를 죽여야만 해, 매덕스
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	Do you think this Alaric
		guy has anything vintage?
		알라릭이란 놈한테
		빈티지 풍 옷이 없을까?
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:51	Crossbows, wooden bullets
		and automatics?
		활과 나무 총알과
		자동 피스톨 장치라?
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:58	Who is this guy, again?
		이 남자 직업이 뭐라고?
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	He's the local vampire hunter.
		이 지역
		뱀파이어 헌터에요
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	Ahh. Well, that explains
		the clothes.
		그래서 이런 옷을 입었군
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	All I could find.
		Guy likes his bourbon.
		이것 밖에 못 찾았어요
		버본 위스키를 좋아하네요
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	I knew there was something
		about him I liked.
		통하는게 있을 줄 알았어
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	Ahh.
		 
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	There's
		a high school dance
		학교 무도회가 있어
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	and I'm gonna need you to
		take out the witch bitch.
		마녀년을 나 대신 잡아주게
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	If she has that much power, she can
		sense me coming from a mile away.
		그 정도로 많은 능력을 가졌다면
		멀리 떨어진 곳에서도 날 감지할거에요
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	I won't be able to get near her.
		You have to do it.
		근처에는 가지도 못할겁니다
		클라우스님이 하셔야 해요
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	In this body?
		I'm a Haggard history teacher.
		이 몸으로?
		난 말라빠진 역사선생이야
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	She can easily hurt me.
		날 쉽게 해칠거라고
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	I mean,
		not me, Klaus me,
		그러니까
		나 말고 이 선생을
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	but you know
		what I mean.
		하지만 무슨 뜻인지 알지
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:34	No witch could handle
		channeling that much power.
		어떤 마녀도 그정도의 힘을
		끌어모을 수 없어요
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	It'll kill her.
		죽게 될 겁니다
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	It would kill me.
		나도 죽을 거구요
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	You just have
		to make her use it.
		그 힘을 사용하도록
		유도해야 하죠
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:44	You mean like provoking her to death?
		그녀를 죽게끔
		자극하라는 건가?
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Won't take long.
		오래 걸리지 않을 거에요
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	Just keep attacking her
		until it kills her.
		계속 죽을 때까지
		공격하면 되죠
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	His body, Alaric's,
		그의 몸
		알라릭은
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	will last longer
		than hers will.
		그녀보다 더 오래
		버텨낼 겁니다
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	How? He's human.
		어떻게?
		그는 인간인걸
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:57	I can help in that department.
		그 부분은 내가 돕죠
00:13:59	 
		 
00:13:59	I can do a spell
		to protect you.
		당신을 보호하는
		주문을 걸죠
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:11	There you are!
		거기 있었네
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	You almost missed me.
		놓칠 뻔 했네
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	How do I look?
		나 어때?
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	Jackie O?
		재키 오니?
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	Duh.
		응
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	You look good.
		잘 어울리는구나
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Thanks.
		고마워
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:25	Is everything ok?
		무슨 일 있어?
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	Ughh, just some work stress.
		업무 스트레스 때문에
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:31	Well, you work
		too much.
		엄마는 너무
		열심히 일해
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:44	Mr. President.
		대통령님
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	- Hey.
		- Hi.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	Sheriff.
		보안관님
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:51	- Sorry.
		- Have fun.
		- 미안
		- 재미있게 즐기고 오렴
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	We will.
		그럴게요
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	Bye.
		Bye.
		 
00:14:58	 
		 
00:15:01	Your relatives
		were such packrats.
		네 친척들은
		많이도 싸두셨다
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Ok, so what do you think?
		어때?
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	Twiggy or sexy hippy?
		트위기(60년대 모델)?
		섹시한 히피?
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	Ooh.
		 
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:15	You know it's not too
		late to back out, right?
		그만 두기엔
		늦지 않은거 알지?
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	And what, miss out
		on all the fun?
		그리곤? 재미를 놓치라고?
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:27	Hey.
		 
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:32	All this time spent
		worrying about Klaus.
		여태껏 우린 클라우스
		걱정하느라 시간을 보냈어
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	I think I convinced myself
		that he's not real.
		난 그가 존재하지 않는다
		믿기 시작했지
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:42	But he is.
		하지만 실제로 있었네
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	And tonight,
		we will put
		오늘 밤에 우리는
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	an end to him.
		결판을 지을거야
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:59	I love you.
		사랑해
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:02	I want you to tell me that
		when the night's over.
		오늘밤이 끝나면
		그 말을 해줘
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:12	Any time tonight.
		언제든 말해주마
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:55	Nice outfit, Mr. Saltzman.
		Totally far out.
		멋진 의상이네요
		살츠만 선생님
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	Thank you, Dana.
		Thank you.
		고맙다, 데이나
		고마워
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Now who is your date?
		네 데이트 상대는 누구지?
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	It's Chad, Mr. Saltzman,
		from third period.
		채드에요 선생님
		3교시를 듣죠
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	Chad, of course.
		물론 채드지
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	How would you and your friends like
		to earn a little extra credit?
		친구들하고 같이
		추가 점수 받고 싶지 않니?
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:15	Wait.
		잠깐
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:20	Look, I, um, I want you to have this.
		이 반지 줄게
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	If you're asking me to go steady,
		I think that was the fifties.
		사귀자는 방법이라면
		그건 50년대 같은데
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
		아니, 진심이야
		보니
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	The ring won't work
		on me, Jeremy.
		그 반지는
		소용 없어, 제레미
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	But it was made
		by a witch.
		하지만 마녀가 만든거잖아
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	To protect from
		the supernatural,
		초자연적인 힘으로부터
		보호하려는 거지
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:35	not for someone who is.
		나 같은 마녀가 아냐
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Well, I have to do
		something.
		난 뭔가 해야 되는걸
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	I can't just...
		I can't just let you get yourself killed.
		난 그냥.. 누나가
		죽는 걸 두고 볼 수 없어
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	Just because a bunch of dead
		witches gave me a warning
		죽은 마녀들 몇명이
		경고를 했다고 해서
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	doesn't mean I'm going to die.
		내가 죽게 되는 건 아냐
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	So you're saying there's
		a 50-50 shot you won't?
		50:50의 생존 가능성이 있단 거야
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:51	Look, I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	But... you know I don't
		have the best luck
		하지만.. 난 여자친구 분야엔
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	in the girlfriend
		department.
		운이 없는거 알잖아
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:58	Hey.
		있지
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Listen, I...
		들어봐
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	I can't explain it.
		설명할 수 없어
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	But I can feel them.
		하지만 기운이 느껴져
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	I'm empowered, Jeremy,
		I can do this.
		능력을 받았어, 제레미
		할 수 있다구
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	I know I can.
		내가 할 수 있는거 알아
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:10	I'm strong enough.
		난 충분히 강력하다고
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:19	Damon.
		데이먼
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	Evenin'.
		좋은 밤이야
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:28	Bonnie.
		보니
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	Oh, you look nice.
		오늘 정말 예쁘다
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	You, too.
		너도
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	You guys
		ready to do this?
		준비 됐어?
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:49	Thanks for being here,
		everybody.
		여러분 모두
		와 주셔서 고마워요
00:18:52	 
		 
00:19:03	We have a special
		shout-out tonight.
		오늘밤 특별한
		신청곡을 받았습니다
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	This is for Elena.
		엘레나한테
		전해달라네요
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	From Klaus.
		클라우스한테서요
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:18	♪ This is dedicated
		to my love ♪
		♪ This is dedicated
		to my love ♪
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	♪ this is dedicated to my love ♪
		♪ this is dedicated to my love ♪
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	♪ this is dedicated ♪
		♪ this is dedicated ♪
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:31	That was a lame,
		cheap shot.
		정말 유치한 싸구려 수법이네
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	He's just trying
		to bait us.
		우리를 꾀고 있어
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:34	I know everyone here.
		여기 있는 사람은
		다 알아
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	Maybe
		he's not here.
		여기 없는 걸수도 있어
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	Just wants us to
		believe that he is.
		여기 있다고
		믿게 하려는 거지
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	It's a party,
		people. Blend.
		파티라구 얘들아
		어울려
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	Let him come to us.
		Good idea.
		- 우리한테 오게 하자
		- 좋은 생각이야
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	No, no, I really don't
		feel like dancing.
		아니, 별로
		춤출 기분이 아냐
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	Too bad.
		안됐네
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:47	There's Ric.
		저기 릭이네
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:49	I'll be back.
		갔다 올게
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:57	Special dedication, huh?
		특별 신청곡?
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:59	This guy's
		a little twisted.
		좀 뒤틀린 놈이네
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	- I'm not impressed.
		- No?
		- 그리 놀랍진 않아
		- 뭐라고?
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	I mean, obviously he didn't
		do anything out of whack.
		그러니까, 정말 정신나간
		짓은 하지 않았잖아
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	Oh.
		 
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:28	Caroline's here.
		They don't know what's going on.
		캐롤라인 왔네
		무슨 일이 있는지 모르잖아
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	- We have to tell her.
		- I'm on it.
		- 말해야 해
		- 내가 할게
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:39	How you doing?
		잘 있었어?
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	Um, freaking out a bit?
		좀 겁 먹었어요
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	You?
		당신은요?
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	Cool as a cucumber.
		오이처럼 시원하지
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	Come on, remember
		the last decade dance?
		지난번 무도회 기억나?
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	The vampires
		were all, "ahh!"
		뱀파이어들이 이렇게 놀래키자
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	And you were all,
		"aahh!"
		넌 겁먹고
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:53	Right. And you won.
		알았어요
		당신이 이겼어요
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	Yes! We did.
		그래, 맞아
00:20:57	 
		 
00:21:01	You're good at this.
		잘하시네요
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	I've got moves
		you've never seen.
		네가 못 본
		댄스실력을 갖췄어
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:07	Dance with me.
		나랑 같이 추자
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	I'm a really bad
		dancer.
		나 춤 잘 못춰
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	I know
		better than that.
		잘 알지
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:20	What?
		뭐?
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	You look really
		pretty tonight.
		오늘 참 예쁘다
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:26	Hey, guys.
		얘들아
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	Hey, man,
		what's up?
		안녕
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	Hey. Do you mind if I steal
		your date for a moment?
		잠깐 네 여친
		빌려도 될까?
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	No, not all.
		괜찮아
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:34	I'll get us something to drink.
		마실 것 좀 가져올게
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	Thanks. Hey.
		고마워
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	What's wrong?
		무슨 일이야?
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	Klaus is here.
		클라우스가 와 있어
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	What?!
		Yeah.
		- 뭐라고?
		- 그래
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:43	Where?
		어디?
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	We have no idea.
		But keep your eye out
		전혀 몰라
		그러니까 조심해
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	for anything
		that might be weird, ok?
		좀 이상한 게 보이면
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:53	May I?
		잠깐 될까?
00:21:55	 
		 
00:22:00	You heard Jeremy and me
		talking, didn't you?
		제레미랑 내가
		하는 말 들었군요
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	- Is it true?
		- Yes.
		- 사실이야?
		- 네
00:22:06	 
		 
00:22:06	The part about you having a
		50-50 shot of surviving?
		생존 가능성이
		50:50 이라는거
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	Is that true?
		사실이니?
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	He was upset. I didn't
		want him to worry.
		화가 나 있었어요
		걱정끼치고 싶지 않았어요
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:14	So you lay it out on the line
		for Elena, no matter what.
		그럼 넌 무슨 일이든
		엘레나를 위해 하겠다?
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:17	No matter what.
		무슨 일이든요
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:19	- Good.
		- You can't tell her.
		- 좋아
		- 말하지 마요
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	Your secret's safe with me,
		but I mean...
		네 비밀은 안전해
		하지만 내 뜻은..
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	With all that power,
		그 모든 능력을 가지고 있으면서
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	isn't there a way
		to increase your odds?
		네 생존가능성을
		늘릴 방법이 없는거니?
00:22:30	 
		 
00:22:30	Careful, Damon.
		조심해요, 데이먼
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	I might start to think
		you actually care.
		사실상 걱정하는 거라
		믿기 시작할지 몰라요
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	We wouldn't want that.
		그건 원치 않지
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:42	What are they up to?
		뭐하는 거지?
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:45	Who knows?
		누가 알아?
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:48	Is there something
		going on, Jer? You ok?
		무슨 일 있어?
		괜찮니?
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:51	Fine.
		응
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:54	I'm fine.
		괜찮아
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:59	Hey.
		엘레나
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	Everything
		all right?
		무슨 일 없어?
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:03	I'm not sure.
		모르겠어
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:10	Jeremy.
		제레미
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:14	What are you doing?
		뭐 하니?
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	Elena thinks we should
		stick together.
		엘레나는 같이
		뭉쳐있길 원해
00:23:16	 
		 
00:23:16	Yeah, I'm fine.
		I've got my ring.
		난 괜찮아요
		반지가 있는 걸요
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:27	It's... it's Bonnie.
		보니 때문에요
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	What is it?
		뭔데?
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:34	Hey, you got
		something
		너 무슨 생각 있으면
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	on your mind,
		spit it out.
		다 털어놔
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:39	If Bonnie takes on Klaus,
		보니가 클라우스를 쓰러뜨리면
00:23:42	 
		 
00:23:43	channeling all that energy's
		going to kill her.
		모든 능력을 쓰다가
		죽을 수도 있어요
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:48	What?
		뭐라고?
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:50	But she doesn't
		want Elena to know,
		엘레나가 알길 원치 않아요
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	'cause if Elena knows,
		she's gonna try to stop her.
		누나가 알면
		말리려 들테니까요
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:56	And it's Elena that could
		turn up dead, so...
		하지만 그러다간
		누나가 죽을 수도 있고
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:02	What am I supposed to do?
		어떻게 해야 되죠?
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:29	I need to talk to you.
		얘기 좀 해
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:36	Come here, come here, come here.
		이리 와봐
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:38	Please tell me
		you didn't know that
		제발 보니가
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:39	Bonnie was on
		a suicide mission.
		자살 임무 수행중인거
		몰랐다고 말해줘
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	Oh, great.
		Jeremy told you
		좋아
		제레미가 말했군
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:42	- and of course you told Elena.
		- Yeah, I told her.
		- 물론 네가 엘레나한테 말했고
		- 그래, 내가 말했다
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	You promised her
		no more secrets.
		더 이상 비밀 없다며
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	I changed my mind.
		생각이 바뀌었어
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	How could you
		not tell me?
		왜 말 안 한거야?
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	- 'Cause I knew how'd you react.
		- No.
		- 그런 반응 보일걸 알고
		- 아니
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:51	- No way, it's not an option.
		- It's our only option.
		- 선택사항이 아냐
		- 우리의 유일한 선택인걸
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:54	Then we'll find
		another way, ok?
		그럼 다른 방법 찾아보자
00:24:57	 
		 
00:24:57	Bonnie, you're not dying
		to save my life.
		보니, 넌 날 구하려
		죽게 되지 않을거야
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	I have the power
		to save you!
		난 널 구할 수 있는
		능력이 있어!
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	If I don't use it
		and something happens,
		그걸 안 써서
		뭔 일이 생기면
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	- that would kill me more.
		- I can't let you.
		- 난 더 아플거야
		- 그렇게 둘 수 없어
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	Just answer
		one question...
		한 가지만 답해줘...
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:09	if the situation
		was reversed,
		상황이 반대였다면
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:12	would you do it for me?
		넌 날 위해 그랬을까?
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:20	So you know why
		I have to.
		왜 내가 해야되는지 알겠지?
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:27	No.
		아니
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:29	No!
		안 돼!
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:44	What's going on, guys?
		무슨 일이니?
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	You ok, Gilbert?
		You don't look so good.
		무슨 일이야, 제레미?
		별로 안 좋아 보인다
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:48	Dude, seriously?
		Wrong day, wrong guy.
		진짜 오늘
		사람 잘못 골랐어
00:25:52	 
		 
00:26:00	Hey!
		야!
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:04	Aaah!
		 
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:08	Let me guess...
		Klaus says hi.
		맞춰보자
		클라우스가 안부전하라니?
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:12	No, no, no, no, don't kill him.
		He's compelled.
		안돼, 죽이지 마
		주문에 걸렸어
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:15	- So? - So, the whole
		thing's a distraction.
		그럼? / 주의를
		돌리려는 수작이야
00:26:17	 
		 
00:26:17	Go find Bonnie and Elena.
		I got this. Go.
		가서 보니랑 엘레나 찾아
		내가 처리할게. 어서
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:24	Elena!
		엘레나!
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	- What is it?
		- He has Jeremy.
		- 무슨 일이죠?
		- 제레미를 잡아갔어
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	- What?
		- What?!
		뭐라구요?
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	Yeah, Klaus has
		Jeremy. Come on.
		그래, 클라우스가
		잡았어, 어서
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:43	Ok, so where
		are you taking us?
		어디로 데려가시는 거죠?
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	Just a little further.
		좀 더 멀리
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	What...
		Something's not right.
		무슨..
		뭔가 이상해
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Where's Jeremy?
		제레미 어디있죠?
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:56	I just had to get away
		from that dance.
		그 무도회장에서
		멀리 데려와야 했어
00:26:59	 
		 
00:26:59	The sixties, uchh.
		60년대라
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:01	Not my decade.
		내가 좋아하는
		시대가 아냐
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	I mean, whose call
		was that, anyway?
		누구 제안이었지?
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	I much prefer the twenties.
		난 20년대가 더 좋은데
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	The style, the parties,
		스타일이나
		파티나
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	the jazz.
		재즈도
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:12	Alaric.
		알라릭
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:15	Are you on vervain?
		마편초 마셨어요?
00:27:17	 
		 
00:27:17	Now why would you ask me
		that question, Elena?
		왜 그 질문을 하지?
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:25	He's being
		compelled.
		주문에 걸렸어
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	Nope. Try again.
		What's going on?
		아니, 다시 물어봐
		무슨 일이야?
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:30	Ok, I'll give you a hint.
		힌트를 주지
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:33	I am not Alaric.
		난 알라릭이 아냐
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:43	Klaus.
		클라우스
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	Surprise!
		놀랐지!
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	Oh, no.
		이런
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:49	No, it's not
		possible.
		불가능해
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	Just relax, Elena.
		I'm not here to hurt you.
		진정해, 엘레나
		널 해치러 온 게 아냐
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:55	You're not on
		my hit list tonight.
		넌 오늘 내
		죽이기 목록에 있지 않아
00:27:59	 
		 
00:27:59	But you are.
		바로 너지
00:28:01	 
		 
00:28:08	Now, did I mention
		that I knew a witch?
		내가 마녀를 알았단거
		말 안했나?
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:13	You're gonna have to hit me
		a lot harder than that.
		넌 그것보다 더
		세게 쳐야 할 걸
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:25	By all means...
		Fire away!
		무슨 수단을 쓰든
		날려봐!
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:29	If you kill this body,
		이 몸둥아리를 작살내면
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:30	I'll just get a new one.
		다른 사람 몸을 구할테니
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	Maybe Jeremy.
		어쩌면 제레미도
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	Go. Run.
		어서 도망쳐
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	Run!
		도망치라고!
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:43	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	- Klaus is in Alaric's body.
		- What?
		- 클라우스가 알라릭 몸안에 있어요
		- 뭐라고?
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	He's possessing it
		or something.
		씌었나봐요
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	Go find Stefan. Now.
		가서 스테판 찾아. 당장
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	- Ok.
		- Now.
		- 좋아요
		- 당장
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:54	Can you kill him?
		죽일 수 있겠어?
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	He's got some kind of
		protection spell.
		무슨 보호 마법이 걸려있어요
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	You have the power of
		a hundred witches. Break it.
		넌 몇 백 마녀들의 힘이 있잖아
		그 마법을 깨봐
00:28:59	 
		 
00:28:59	I'm trying!
		노력중이에요
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	If I kill Alaric,
		내가 알라릭을 죽이면
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:02	he'll just possess
		someone else.
		다른 사람 몸에
		들어갈 거에요
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	He knows I have
		my power, Damon.
		내가 능력을 가진 사실을
		알고 있어요, 데이먼
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	He's trying
		to kill me.
		날 죽이려는 거에요
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:09	No.
		아니
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	Klaus does not get
		to win tonight, no way.
		클라우스는 오늘밤
		이기지 않을거야, 절대
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:14	You still willing to do
		whatever it takes to kill him?
		넌 아직도 그를 죽이기 위한
		모든 방법을 동원하고 싶니?
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:30	Hey! Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:32	Um...Yeah.
		응
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	I'm just...
		I'm looking for Stefan.
		난...
		스테판 찾고 있었어
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	Seriously,
		what's wrong?
		진짜 무슨 일이야?
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:38	Uh, just, um,
		그냥
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:41	stay with Matt, ok?
		맷하고 같이 있어
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:44	What was that about?
		방금 무슨 일이야?
00:29:47	 
		 
00:29:47	Oh, you know,
		just same old drama.
		뻔한 드라마지
00:29:51	 
		 
00:30:12	What took you so long?
		왜 이리 오래 걸렸어?
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:15	Now, do you want
		to do this the easy way
		이제, 쉬운 방법을 쓸래
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:19	or the hard way?
		어려운 방법을 쓸래?
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:22	Oww!
		 
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:30	The hard way. Got it.
		어려운 방법
		알았어
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:37	What? You'd kill your
		favorite history teacher?
		뭐야? 가장 좋아하는
		역사선생을 죽이겠다?
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	It's what Alaric
		would want.
		알라릭이 원할거에요
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:44	And he'd want you
		to suffer first.
		먼저 당신이
		고통받길 원할걸요
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	Look at you.
		너 좀 봐
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:49	Is that all you got?
		그것밖에 안돼?
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:54	Let's find out.
		어디 알아보죠
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:57	There you are.
		거기 있었네
00:30:58	 
		 
00:30:58	What are you doing?
		Where's Bonnie?
		뭐 하는 거야?
		보니는?
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:00	She's doing what
		she has to do.
		해야하는 일을
		하고 있지
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:02	- What?!
		- Where is she?
		- 뭐라고?
		- 어디있는데?
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	- Stefan, let her do this.
		- Damn it, Damon, where is she?!
		- 스테판. 그냥 내버려둬
		- 젠장. 어디있는데?
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:31	Bonnie, no!
		보니, 안돼!
00:31:32	 
		 
00:32:18	No!
		안돼!
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:22	Oh! Bonnie!
		보니!
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:26	Bonnie, Bonnie!
		보니!
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:28	Bonnie, Bonnie, hey, hey!
		보니!
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	Stefan, she's not breathing!
		스테판, 숨을 안 쉬어!
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	Stefan! Stefan,
		I can't find her pulse!
		스테판! 스테판
		맥박이 안 느껴져
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	Stefan!
		Do something, please!
		스테판
		뭐든 해봐, 제발!
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	Stefan, please! Just give her
		blood, do something, please!
		스테판, 피를 주던가
		뭔가 해보라고 제발!
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:45	It's too late.
		너무 늦었어
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	No!
		안돼!
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	No.
		안돼
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	No, no, no, no, no!
		안된다구!
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:56	Bonnie! Bonnie,
		please, no!
		보니, 제발!
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	No, no, no, no,
		no, no, no, no!
		안 돼!
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	Stefan, get Elena
		out of here.
		스테판, 엘레나 끌어내
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:03	I'll deal with this.
		내가 처리하마
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	What do you mean,
		deal with this?
		처리하겠다니
		무슨 말이죠?
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	The sheriff
		can't know about this.
		보안관이 알아서는 안돼
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	Last thing we need's
		another mysterious death.
		지금 또다른
		알수 없는 사건을 만들 수 없잖아
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	This is Bonnie!
		이건 보니라구요!
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:13	Get her home.
		집에 데려가
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	Now.
		당장
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	Klaus.
		클라우스
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:18	Hey, hey, hey.
		엘레나
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	- Hey.
		- No. Jeremy.
		안돼. 제레미
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	Oh, my God, Jeremy.
		What about Jeremy?
		세상에, 제레미
		제레미는?
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:26	- I'll find him.
		- No!
		- 내가 찾을게
		- 안돼!
00:33:28	 
		 
00:34:02	Damon! Hey, I got your message,
		I can't find anyone.
		데이먼, 메세지 받았어요
		찾을 수가 없어요
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	Where's Elena,
		where's Bonnie?
		누나는 어디 있죠?
		보니는요?
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:11	We need to have
		a little talk.
		얘기 좀 해야겠다
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:37	Hey.
		안녕
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:43	Here, drink this.
		이거 마셔
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:47	I can't.
		안 돼
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:49	Yeah. Yeah, you can.
		괜찮아
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	Please drink this.
		어서 마셔
00:34:53	 
		 
00:35:02	This is my fault.
		내 잘못이야
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	No, no, no, no, no.
		안 돼
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:06	No. Hey.
		안녕
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:08	This was Klaus.
		Listen to me.
		이건 클라우스야
		들어봐
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:10	Klaus did this.
		클라우스가 한 짓이야
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:16	What did you do with her?!
		보니를 어떻게 한거에요?
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	Will you please
		calm her down?
		제발 진정시킬래?
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	Don't talk like I'm not
		내가 바로 앞에 서있는거
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	standing right
		in front of you.
		안보여요?
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:22	- Please calm down.
		- You knew!
		- 제발 진정시켜
		- 알고 있었죠?
00:35:25	 
		 
00:35:25	Didn't you? You knew that if
		she harnessed all that power,
		그랬죠? 그 많은
		힘을 사용하면
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	- that she would die, didn't you?
		- Yes.
		- 죽을걸 알았죠?
		- 그래
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:31	Yes, I knew.
		알았어
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	Guhh!
		 
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:36	You need
		to listen to me,
		얘기 좀 들으렴
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:38	and prepare for what
		I'm about to say.
		내가 말할 것에 대한
		준비를 해
00:35:41	 
		 
00:35:53	Bonnie had to die.
		보니는 죽어야 했어
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:56	Klaus using Alaric's body
		was a total surprise.
		알라릭의 몸에 들어간
		클라우스는 정말 놀라운 일이었지
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	She wasn't prepared
		for that.
		보니는 그것에 대한
		대비를 못했어
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:05	And he wasn't
		going to stop,
		클라우스는
		멈추려 하지 않았지
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:06	and we weren't going
		to be able to stop him
		우리는 그를 멈출 수 없었을거야
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	until he knew
		she was dead.
		그녀가 죽은걸
		보기 전까지
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:12	He had to believe it.
		죽었다 믿게 만들어야만 했지
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:28	Hey! Hey! Hey!
		보니!
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:36	She cast a spell.
		주문을 걸었어
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	She's alive, Elena.
		살아있어, 엘레나
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	Bonnie's ok.
		보니는 괜찮아
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:58	You know,
		you could have told me.
		미리 알려줄 수 있었잖아
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:00	How do I know when
		you're going to go
		어떻게 알아
		네가 가서
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	blabbing things
		to your girlfriend.
		네 여친한테
		불어버릴지
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	You even understand
		what you put her through?
		엘레나가 어땠는지
		이해 못해?
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	See, that's why
		I didn't tell you.
		그래서 말 안 한 거야
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:08	'Cause you would have
		never been able to do it.
		그렇게 둘 수 없었을 테니까
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	Don't get me wrong,
		Stefan.
		오해는 하지마
00:37:12	 
		 
00:37:12	I don't mind
		being the bad guy.
		난 나쁜놈 되는 거 상관 없어
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:14	I'll make all the life
		and death decisions
		난 삶과 죽음의 결정을 내릴거야
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:17	while you're busy worrying
		about collateral damage.
		넌 부차적인 피해를
		걱정하느라 바쁜 동안 말야
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:21	I'll even let her
		hate me for it.
		엘레나가 날 미워하게
		둘 수도 있어
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	But at the end
		of the day,
		하지만 결국에는
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	I'll be the one
		to keep her alive.
		그녀를 살리는 건
		내가 될거야
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:41	You sure it's safe here?
		여기 안전한 거 확실해?
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:43	Yeah, I'm sure.
		그럼
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:47	What is that?
		그게 뭐야?
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	It is MiFi.
		MiFi 라는 거야
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	If we're gonna be stuck here,
		여기 갇혀 있을 거면
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	then we might as well
		have Internet.
		인터넷은 있어야지
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	You don't have to stay
		down here with me.
		나랑 같이 있을 필요 없어
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:57	Hey, look, I'm not
		letting you out of my sight.
		누나를 내 시선 밖에
		두지 않을거야
00:38:01	 
		 
00:38:04	I... I need you
		to talk to Elena for me.
		엘레나한테
		얘기해줘
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	Tell her how sorry I am for
		what Damon and I had to do.
		나와 데이먼이 한 선택에
		얼마나 미안한지
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	Well, um...
		그럼..
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	Why don't you
		직접
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:16	tell her yourself?
		말하는게 어때?
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	Bonnie!
		보니!
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:23	Please.
		제발
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:24	Elena, I'm so sorry.
		엘레나, 정말 미안해
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	It's ok, it's ok.
		괜찮아
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	I just needed
		to see your face now.
		네 얼굴을
		직접 보고 싶었어
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	There wasn't enough time
		for me to tell you.
		제대로 말할 시간이 없었어
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	It's ok, seriously.
		Damon explained it all to me.
		괜찮아
		데이먼이 다 말해줬어
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:44	Ugh. Look.
		봐
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	Klaus had to think
		she was dead.
		클라우스는 죽은 줄
		알아야만 했지
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	Your reaction
		had to be real.
		네 반응은
		진짜 같았어야 했어
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:53	I understand why
		you did what you did.
		왜 그런 선택을 했는지
		이해했어요
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	Klaus was fooled,
		클라우스가 속았죠
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	and Bonnie's alive.
		보니는 살아남았구요
00:39:02	 
		 
00:39:03	Here's to duplicity.
		사기를 위하여
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:08	But let's get one thing
		straight, Damon.
		한가지는 바로잡죠, 데이먼
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	Bonnie will not die for me,
		I will not let that happen.
		보니는 날 위해 죽지 않을거에요
		그렇게 두지 않을거죠
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	We need to kill Klaus, Elena.
		클라우스를 죽여야 해, 엘레나
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:16	Real Klaus.
		진짜 클라우스를
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	Who will probably be coming
		to pay you a visit soon
		곧 방문을 할거야
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	now that he knows
		that Bonnie is dead.
		보니가 죽었단걸 아니까
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	She's the only one
		who can do it.
		보니만이 할 수 있어
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:26	We'll find another way.
		다른 방법을 찾아보죠
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:29	I hope so.
		그러길 바라
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:35	Look, I shouldn't
		have hit you.
		당신을 때리지 말았어야 했는데
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:38	Apology accepted.
		사과 받아들였어
00:39:41	 
		 
00:39:43	Let me be clear
		about something.
		한가지 정리하자
00:39:46	 
		 
00:39:46	If it comes down to you and the witch
		again, I will gladly let Bonnie die.
		만약 너랑 마녀만이 남는다면
		난 기꺼이 보니를 죽게 둘거야
00:39:51	 
		 
00:39:53	I will always choose you.
		난 늘 널 택할거지
00:39:57	 
		 
00:40:08	Good night, Damon.
		잘 자요, 데이먼
00:40:09	 
		 
00:40:10	Good night.
		너도
00:40:12
