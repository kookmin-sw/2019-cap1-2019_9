00:00:00	My name is Elena Gilbert.
		I'm a vampire.
		내 이름은 엘레나 길버트
		뱀파이어다
00:00:03	 
		 
00:00:03	 
		살아남는법을 배우는 중인데
		문제가 생겼다
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	You're sired to me, Elena.
		Everything you think you fell,
		나한테 복종됐자나, 엘레나
		네가 느낀다고 생각하는것들이
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	might not even be real.
		진짜가 아닐수도 있어
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	But there's
		hope now.
		지금은 희망이 생겼다
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	Tell them what the hunter
		told you the tattoo leads to.
		문신이 뭘
		가르키는지 말해
00:00:12	 
		문신이 뭘
		가르키는지 말해
00:00:12	He said there was
		a cure.
		문신이 뭘
		가르키는지 말해
00:00:13	He said there was
		a cure.
		 
00:00:13	He said there was
		a cure.
		치료제가 있데
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	Everyone wants it
		for a different reason.
		모두들 각각 다른이유로
		치료제를 원한다
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	For revenge...
		복수하기 위해서
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	Ohh!
		 
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	To be human
		an in love...
		사람이 되서
		사랑을 하려고
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	For the truth...
		진실을 위해서
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	I'm setting you
		free, Elena.
		널 놔주는거야, 엘레나
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:25	And some will
		stop at nothing to get it.
		누군가는 아무것도
		얻지 못하게 될것이다
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Do it!
		어서 해
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:34	Carol Lockwood
		always said that togetherness,
		캐롤 락우드는 항상
		함께 하는 것이,
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	in times of tragedy,
		참사 속에서도,
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	leads to healing.
		치유로 이끈다고
		하였습니다
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:43	That one community is stronger
		than a thousand of its members.
		하나의 공동체가 천명의
		사람보다 강건하다구요
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	But how does a community
		stay strong
		그렇지만 어떻게 공동체가
		리더를 잃었는데
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:51	after losing its leader?
		강건할 수 있을까요?
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:53	And Carol was so much
		more than just a mayor.
		그리고 캐롤은 단지
		시장일뿐만이 아니라
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	She was...
		그녀는...
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:00	An open-minded friend...
		마음이 넓은 친구이자
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:04	And a concerned mother,
		고심하는 어머니였는데
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	taken from us too soon
		뜻밖에 사고로
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:09	by a terrible accident.
		우리 곁을 너무
		일찍 떠났습니다
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:14	Screw this.
		될대로 되라지
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:16	Tyler.
		타일러
00:01:18	 
		 
00:01:18	Tyler.
		타일러
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:23	Please join me in observing
		잠시 그녀를 기리며
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:26	a minute of silence
		in her memory.
		묵념하겠습니다
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:45	You ok?
		괜찮아?
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:48	I'll be right back.
		금방 올게
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	Thank you very much.
		감사합니다
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	In the wake of this tragedy, the
		town has selected an interim mayor.
		애도하는 와중에도
		임시 시장을 뽑았습니다
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	Many of you already know him.
		많은 분들은
		알고 계실겁니다
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:00	Please welcome Mr. Rudy Hopkins.
		루디 홉킨스씨를
		환영해주세요
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:07	Thank you, sheriff.
		고마워요 보안관님
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	Carol Lockwood put
		this town first,
		캐롤 락우드는 이 마을을
		중요하게 생각했습니다
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	and that's why I'm here
		to talk to you guys.
		그래서 제가 이자리에
		서게 된 것입니다
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	You folks...
		여러분들이...
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:35	April?
		에이프릴?
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:38	What's wrong?
		왜그래?
00:02:40	 
		 
00:02:40	Nothing. I'm fine.
		아무것도 아니에요
		괜찮아요
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:43	But you're crying.
		근데 울고 있자나
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:46	It's just the whole
		mayor thing.
		시장님때문에
		그런거에요
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	You know,
		it's bringing up stuff with my dad.
		아빠일이
		생각나거든요
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:51	And I know you're
		a vampire.
		그리고 언니가
		뱀파이어인거 알아요
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:55	Wait. What?
		잠깐 뭐라고?
00:02:57	 
		 
00:03:03	Oh, was that
		necessary?
		그럴 필요가 있었어요?
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	No, but it was fun.
		아니 근데 재밌자나
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:08	 
		한글자막 누리닷
		nuridot.tistory.com
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:14	Hey, you just missed
		너 학교집회 빠졌자나
00:03:16	 
		너 학교집회 빠졌자나
00:03:16	the mandatory
		all-school assembly.
		너 학교집회 빠졌자나
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	Well, that's because I'm
		혼자서 술을 마셔야
		했으니까
00:03:18	 
		혼자서 술을 마셔야
		했으니까
00:03:18	at a mandatory all-alone
		drinking party.
		혼자서 술을 마셔야
		했으니까
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	Seriously?
		You decided to go
		이럴거야?
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	on a ripper
		bender now?
		지금 술이나 진탕
		먹겠다는거야?
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:24	My brother slept with Elena.
		형이 엘레나랑 잤자나
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	Kind of puts a little bit
		of a damper on things.
		그래서 잠시
		쉬어야겠어
00:03:28	 
		 
00:03:28	First of all,
		you are not supposed to know that.
		첫째로, 넌 그걸
		알아선 안되
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	Second of all, Tyler is already
		spiraling, and he gets priority.
		둘째로, 타일러가 겉돌고 있어
		눈여겨봐야대
00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:34	His mother just died.
		What do you expect?
		어머니가 돌아가셨는데
		어떻겠어?
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	I'm his girlfriend.
		I expect him to talk to me.
		난 여자친구니까
		나한테 말해줬음 하는거지
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	But instead he's all angry,
		and it doesn't help that
		화 내는것 대신에
		엄마의 죽음을 사고로
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	everyone keeps referring to his
		mother's death as an accident,
		감춰야 하는건
		도움이 되지 않아
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:43	which is really just a polite
		way of saying that she was drunk.
		취했다는 것보단
		공손한 표현이긴 하지
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	You think Klaus
		killed her?
		클라우스가
		죽였다고 생각해?
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	Well, I don't think
		she drowned in a Martini glass.
		글세, 술잔에 빠진건
		아닌것 같은데
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	Just get it together.
		I can't do it alone.
		일단 몸 좀 추스려
		혼자선 못하니까
00:03:56	 
		 
00:04:10	The assembly's over.
		집회는 끝났어요
00:04:11	 
		 
00:04:11	What the hell's going on?
		대체 뭐하는거야?
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:13	The school will
		be empty soon.
		좀 있으면 학교엔
		아무도 없을거에요
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:15	How many times
		did you compel me?
		몇번이나 나한테
		주술을 걸었어요?
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	Don't...
		Just don't lie.
		거짓말 하지 마요
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:21	Rebekah says
		you lie.
		레베카가 거짓말 할
		거라고 말했으니까
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	Rebekah's not who you
		think she is, April.
		레베카는 네가 생각하는
		그런 사람이 아니야
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:25	What, she's not a thousand-year-old
		original vampire?
		천년이나 산 오리지널
		뱀파이어가 아니라구요?
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	Listen, we can
		figure this out, ok,
		저기, 우리가
		해결할 수 있을거야
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	but we have
		to get out of here.
		그전에 여길
		벗어나야되
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:34	Sorry.
		Not allowed.
		미안, 허락 못해
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:39	Why don't you
		take a seat?
		좀 앉지 그래?
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	The rest of the class
		will be here shortly.
		나머지 애들도
		곧 올거야
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:47	First saved message.
		첫번째 저장된
		메세지입니다
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	Hey, it's me.
		안녕, 저에요
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	Look, I know
		why you sent me away.
		저기, 날 왜
		보냈는지 알아요
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:53	You think that what I'm feeling for
		you is because of the sire bond,
		당신에 대한 감정이
		주종관계 때문이라고 생각하죠
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	but I hate not being
		near you.
		근데 곁에 있지
		못해서 내가 힘들어요
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:07	Go ahead.
		Make a move.
		어서, 좀 움직여봐
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	I drove up here to be your wingman,
		not kick your ass.
		널 도와주려고 온거지
		혼내려고 온게 아냐
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:19	Aah! Ok.
		그만
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:21	I get it.
		I get it.
		알았어 알았다구
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	You're a badass.
		대단한데
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:29	You see that?
		봤어요?
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	Couldn't miss it.
		It was in slow motion.
		놓쳤을리가 있나
		너무 느렸거든
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	Then teach me
		something useful.
		그럼 좀 쓸만한것좀
		가르쳐줘요
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	We've been here
		for days, and so far
		여기 며칠동안
		있었는데
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	all you've done
		is bark orders.
		주문할때 소리만
		질러댄거 말곤 없자나요
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:42	Ok.
		좋아
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:45	Take a seat at
		the bench, quarterback.
		쿼터백은 벤치에
		앉아있어
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:47	Karate kid wts
		a anot at the title.
		가라데 애기가
		검은띠를 따고 싶데
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	Jeremy, you're
		not ready for this.
		제레미, 넌 아직 힘들어
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:54	Well?
		어떡할래?
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:57	Now, all I have to do is apply
		a little pressure under your jaw.
		이제, 턱 밑에 좀 더
		힘을 주면 되는건가
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:05	Really? Again?
		진짜? 또?
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:10	Ok.
		 
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:13	Double pepperoni
		3 days in a row.
		페퍼로니 피자
		3일 연속이네요

		anything else?
		다른건 안먹어요?
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	Why?
		Are you offering?
		왜요? 사주게요?
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:20	A little something
		extra, cut off
		두둑히 드릴테니
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	the pizza pipeline
		for a couple days.
		며칠동안
		배달오지 마세요
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	No matter how much they beg,
		don't come back.
		쟤들이 얼마나 사정하던지
		오지 마세요
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:27	Sorry, guys.
		안타깝네요
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	You're gonna
		starve us now?
		우릴 굶기려구요?
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	If that's what it takes
		그래야 네가
		헌터가 된다면야
00:06:31	 
		그래야 네가
		헌터가 된다면야
00:06:31	to make you a hunter.
		그래야 네가
		헌터가 된다면야

		곁에 있고 싶어요
		보고싶어요, 데이먼
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	I wish you would just
		let me come to you.
		날 불러줬음 좋겠어요
00:06:57	 
		 
00:07:01	What?
		왜?
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	Guess who.
		누구게
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	I'm back, dagger-free,
		돌와왔어, 단검 뽑구
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	and I'm holding Elena
		hostage at the High School.
		그리고 학교에서
		엘레나 붙잡고 있지
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	Just thought you should know.
		그냥 알아두라구
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	Who the hell was
		dumb enough
		어떤 멍청이가
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:10	to pull that dagger
		out of you?
		단검을 뽑아준거야?
00:07:11

		the questions today.
		오늘 대답해줄게
00:07:13

		이따 보자

		세상밖으로 나올
		경우에만 대화할거야
00:07:28	 
		세상밖으로 나올
		경우에만 대화할거야
00:07:28	if you're ready
		to rejoin civilization.
		세상밖으로 나올
		경우에만 대화할거야
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	How would you like to drive the white
		oak stake through Rebekah's heart?
		레베카한테 오크막대기를
		꼽는 경우는 어떻겠어?
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	If it means you're not drinking your
		way through the mystic grill, sure.
		술만 먹지 않는다면야
		당연하지
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	So...
		그래서...
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	First speech
		under your belt.
		첫번째 연설을
		잘 하셨네요
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	Now for the fun part.
		이제 흥미로운
		부분이에요
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	Welcome to the world
		of careful cover-ups.
		은폐공작소에
		오신걸 환영합니다
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	We've ruled Carol's death
		as head trauma from a fall.
		캐롤의 죽음을 추락에 의한
		두개골 출혈이라고 정의했어요
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	That's the official
		autopsy.
		그게 공식적인
		사인이에요
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	She did not go
		gently, did she?
		편하게 죽은건
		아니군요, 그쵸? 
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	Any leads?
		단서라도 있나요?
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	We have ideas.
		의심가는건 있는데
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Let me guess.
		제가 말해볼까요
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	Sharp teeth and bad
		table manners?
		날카로운 이빨에
		식사 예절없는 애들이죠?
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	You sure you want this?
		정말로 하고
		싶은거 맞아요?
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	I mean, 6 people were
		offered this job before you.
		당신 전에 6명에게
		권했는데
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:06	They all said no
		for a reason.
		모두들 거부했어요
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	I'm saying yes
		for a reason,
		이유가 있어서
		하겠다고 한겁니다
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	and my reason
		just walked in.
		내 이유가 방금
		들어왔네요
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:14	I'll let you know what we find.
		Thank you, sheriff.

		-고마워요, 보안관님
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	Hey, sheriff.
		Hey, dad.
		안녕하세요, 보안관님
		안녕, 아빠
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	- Hey.
		- So...
		-어서와
		-그럼...
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	Far cry from being
		a traveling pharmaceutical rep.
		떠돌이 제약회사 외판원이랑은
		너무 다른데요
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	I noticed a few of your friends
		missing from the assembly.
		네 친구들 몇명이
		집회에서 보이질 않더구나
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	So much for mandatorat
		I guess, huh?
		의무집회라 해도
		안듣는구나?
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	Dad, stop it.
		아빠, 그만하세요
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	You can't come in here
		and start making rules.
		여기와서 규칙을
		만들순 없어요
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	I think this town could
		use a few more rules.
		이 마을은 규칙이
		좀 필요한 것 같은데
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	You're forgetting I can
		help protect the town.
		여긴 나도
		지킬 수 있어요
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	I am well aware
		of your gifts, Bonnie...
		네 재능은
		나도 잘 알아
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	But don't forget
		I'm your father.
		하지만 내가 아빠란거
		잊지 마라
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	That means that I get
		to protect you.
		그 말은 내가 널
		지켜줘야 하는거야
00:08:48	 
		그 말은 내가 널
		지켜줘야 하는거야
00:08:48	 
		 
00:09:05	 
		2층 이상무
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:33	 
		1층 내가 주의를 끌테니
		네가 찔러
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	Hello, Stefan.
		안녕, 스테판
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:39	I'm here.
		What do you want?
		여기 왔자나
		뭘 원해?
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	The same thing I wanted when
		you helped make Klaus stab me.
		클라우스를 도와
		날 찔렀을때 원했던거
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	The cure.
		치료제군
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:49	I hope you're not waiting for
		Caroline to show up and stake me...
		날 찌르려고 캐롤라인
		기다리진 않길 바래
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:54	Because I already
		found her.
		내가 먼저 찾았거든
00:09:56	 
		 
00:10:07	Stefan.
		스테판
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	Did I say
		you could move?
		내가 움직여도 된댔어?
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:12	Class is in session.
		수업 시작이야
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	You've all been compelled.
		You know the rules.
		모두들 주술에 걸렸으니
		규칙은 알겠지
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	Answer my questions
		honestly,
		정직하게 질문에 대답해
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	no disobedience,
		반항은 안돼
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	no one leaves.
		아무도 못 떠나
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	April, my sweet,
		take notes.
		에이프릴 적어둬
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	This is how you get
		answers in this town.
		이 마을에선 대답을
		이렇게 듣는거야
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	Let's start with
		a little quiz.
		작은 퀴즈부터 해볼까
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	In the year 1114, my brother
		learned... thanks to yours truly...
		1114년 오빠가,
		너희덕분이야, 
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	About a brotherhood of
		vampire hunters with tattoos
		문신을 가진 헌터
		조직에 대해 알게됬어
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	that grew with each kill.
		뱀파이어를 죽일때마다
		문신이 늘어나지
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	And these tattoos
		reveal what? Elena?
		이 문신이 뭘 뜻한다?
		엘레나?
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	A map.
		지도
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	Which led to,
		Caroline?
		어디로 이끄는?
		캐롤라인?
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	A cure for vampirism.
		뱀파이어 치료제
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	Perfect.
		We're all caught up.
		완벽해
		다들 알고있군
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Stefan Salvatore, the last time
		we saw each other,
		스테판 살바토어
		마지막으로 만났을때
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	you had a vampire hunter,
		but in order to decode the map,
		넌 헌터를 데리고 있었고
		지도를 해석하려고 했지
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	you needed the location
		of the hunter's sword,
		넌 헌터의 검의
		위치가 필요했어
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	which you got out of me
		using some very dirty tricks.
		더러운 수를 써서
		나한테 알아냈지
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Assuming you found the sword,
		you must have found the cure,
		검을 찾았다고 가정하면
		넌 치료제도 가지고 있을텐데
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	and yet you're all
		still vampires,
		근데 아직 모두들
		뱀파이어네
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	which means something
		went wrong.
		그말은 뭔가
		잘못됐다는거지
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	What are you doing?
		뭐하는거야?
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	You asked me
		to take notes.
		받아 적으라면서요
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	I wasn't being
		literal, darling.
		말 그대로
		그러란게 아니었어
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	But now that you mention it,
		a flow chart would be nice,
		근데 네가 말나온김에,
		차트에 하면 멋질거니까
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:16	which means index cards
		and push pins. Go fetch.
		가서 색인 카드랑
		핀좀 가지고 와
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:20	You're wasting
		your time.
		시간 낭비야
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	We don't know
		anything.
		우린 아무것도 몰라
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	So you just gave up?
		그럼 그냥 포기했다고?
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	I thought you'd do
		anything to save Elena,
		엘레나를 구하려고
		무슨짓이든 할줄 알았는데
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	even if it meant taking
		the cure yourself
		심지어 너도
		치료제를 먹고
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	so you could grow old
		and die with her.
		엘레나와 함께
		늙어 죽을거랬자나
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:37	Why do you look
		so surprised?
		왜 그렇게 놀라?
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:44	I'm missing something.
		What is it?
		뭔가 놓쳤군
		그게 뭐야?
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:48	They broke up, ok?
		얘네 깨졌어, 됐어?
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:52	Now let us go.
		이제 보내줘
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Broke up?
		깨졌다고?
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:57	Wait. I'm confused.
		잠깐, 헷갈리네
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	I thought Elena was
		your epic love, Stefan.
		엘레나가 대단한
		사랑인줄 알았는데
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:04	I asked you what happened,
		무슨일이었냐고 묻자나
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	and you have to tell me.
		그럼 대답을 해야지
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	She slept with Damon.
		데이먼이랑 잤어
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:28	Good.
		잘했어
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:30	Now...
		이제...
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:34	Now do it like your life
		depends on it 'cause it does.
		네 생사가 걸린것처럼 해봐
		분명 그리 될테니까
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	Don't act like you care
		about my life.
		날 걱정하는것처럼
		굴지마요
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	You care about the hunter's
		mark and curing Elena
		헌터의 표식과
		치료제만 걱정하자나요
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	so she's not sired
		to your ass.
		그래야 엘레나가
		복종에서 풀려날테니
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	Both require you
		to be alive,
		둘다 네가
		살아있어야만 해
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	which is why I've updated our relationship
		status to "it's complicated."
		그래서 내가 우리 사이를
		"복잡하다"라고 업데이트 했지
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:51	You talked
		to her at all?
		얘기해봤어?
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	Elena?
		엘레나랑?
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	Maybe.
		어쩌면요
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	Why? Run out of
		voicemails to listen to?
		왜요? 들을 메세지가
		떨어저가요?
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	I'm sorry.
		Did I interrupt play time?
		미안한데
		내가 노는걸 방해한건가?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	What the hell are
		you doing here?
		대체 넌 여기 왜온거야?
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	I'm simply
		appreciating
		그냥 감사하려고
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	the sights and
		smells of nature,
		경관과 자연의 향기
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	neither of which
		presently include
		여기서 뱀파이어 썩는내가
		나질 않으니까
00:13:09	 
		여기서 뱀파이어 썩는내가
		나질 않으니까
00:13:09	rotting
		vampire flesh,
		여기서 뱀파이어 썩는내가
		나질 않으니까
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	so I'm a bit
		concerned.
		그래서 좀
		걱정이 되더라구
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	How many vampires
		has he killed?
		얘가 몇명이나 죽였어?
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	If we throw Jeremy out into
		the world right now, he's chum.
		제레미를 바깥세상에 지금
		내논다면 찌꺼기만 남을걸
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	Now, see,
		that's not a number.
		있지, 그건
		숫자가 아니자나
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	12... that's
		a number.
		12명... 이게 숫자지
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	That's how many
		of my hybrids
		검으로 죽인
		하이브리드 숫자야
00:13:24	 
		검으로 죽인
		하이브리드 숫자야
00:13:24	I slaughtered
		with my sword.
		검으로 죽인
		하이브리드 숫자야
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	3... that's how many
		days it took
		3일... 이나 걸렸어
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	to quell the urge to
		kill your brother, after
		네 동생을 죽이고
		싶은걸 참는데
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	he knowingly watched
		as I walked into a death trap.
		내가 함정으로 걸어가는걸
		알면서도 보고만 있더라구
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	One...
		1개...
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	That's the number of
		purposes you serve.
		네가 존재하는 이유지
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	You are here to
		grow Jeremy's mark,
		제레미의 표식을
		키울려고 여기 있는거야
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	so I ask again...
		다시 물어볼게
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	How many vampires has
		he killed since he's been here?
		여기온뒤로 뱀파이어
		몇명이나 죽였어?
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Zero.
		0
00:13:49	 
		 
00:13:49	Hmm. That's a pity.
		안타깝네
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:53	I'm going to need
		that cure
		치료제가 필요해
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	sooner rather
		than later,
		조만간에
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:57	hybrid shortage
		and all.
		하이브리드가
		부족해질테니까
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	How can I help?
		어떻게 도와줄까?
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	You know...
		저기말이야...
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	Now that you mention it,
		네가 도와준댔으니까
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	Jeremy...
		Watch and learn.
		제레미... 보고 배워
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:15	That's for Carol Lockwood.
		캐롤 락우드를
		죽인 몫이야
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:22	So, vampire Elena is
		a trollop who likes bad boys,
		그럼, 뱀파이어
		엘레나는
00:14:24	So, vampire Elena is
		a trollop who likes bad boys,
		 
00:14:24	So, vampire Elena is
		a trollop who likes bad boys,
		나쁜남자 좋아하는
		그런 여자인거네
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	which explains why Stefan
		reeks of alcohol.
		그래서 스테판한테서
		술냄새가 나는거구나
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	But what it doesn't explain
		is why sweet, loving,
		근데 이해 못하겠는건
		왜 사랑스럽고 달콤하고
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	innocent Elena could be
		so heartless towards Stefan.
		순수한 엘레나가 스테판한테
		무정하게 굴수 있냐는거지
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:42	How could she hurt you
		like that? Answer, please.
		어떻게 그리 상처를
		줄 수 있어? 대답해줘
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:46	She didn't know it
		at the time,
		그때는 그걸 몰랐어
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	but she was sired to Damon.
		데이먼한테 복종한다는걸
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:52	A sire bond. Fascinating.
		주종관계라, 재밌는데
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:56	And what do you think
		about that, Elena?
		넌 어떻게
		생각해, 엘레나?
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	I think you're sad
		and bored
		너가 불쌍하고
		지루하다고 생각해
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	and in desperate need
		of a hobby.
		그리고 취미가 절실히
		필요하다고 생각해
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	You're hiding something.
		'Fess up.
		뭔가 숨기고 있군
		고백해
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	I didn't sleep with Damon
		because of his sire bond.
		주종관계 때문에
		데이먼이랑 잔게 아니야
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	I slept with Damon because
		I'm in love with him.
		데이먼을
		사랑하니까 잔거지
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:25	What does any of this have
		to do with the stupid cure?
		이게 대체 치료제랑
		무슨 상관이야?
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:30	You're right.
		We got off the point.
		네 말이 맞아
		딴길로 샜네
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	Stefan, how do I
		find the cure?
		스테판 치료제를
		어떻게 찾지?
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	Unless you'd rather talk
		about Damon and Elena all day.
		델레나 얘기를 하루종일
		하고 싶다면야
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	There's a Professor.
		He knows where the cure is.
		교수가 있는데
		그가 치료제 위치를 알아
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	Thank you. And, uh,
		where do I find this Professor?
		고마워, 이 교수는
		어디서 찾을 수 있어?
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Oh, and so now I'm "gifted"?
		He hates my witch heritage.
		이젠 재능이라고?
		아빠는 마녀를 싫어했어요
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	That's why he travels all the time.
		He can't handle it.
		그래서 항상 여행다닌거죠
		대면하지 못하니까
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	And suddenly he wants to
		be a protective father?
		갑자기 아빠로서
		보호하고 싶다나?
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	No. Not like this.
		안돼, 이건 아니에요
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	Come on. Distract me.
		제발, 다른 얘기
		좀 해봐요
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:57	Isn't there some...
		다른거 뭐...
00:15:59	 
		 
00:15:59	Magic therapy thing you
		haven't shown me yet?
		아직 안보여준
		마법의 치료 없어요?
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	Listen, Bonnie, I hate
		to tell you this...
		저기 보니
		이런말 하기 싫지만
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	Actually, you know what?
		I take that back.
		사실은 있자나?
		그 말 취소할게
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	I'm proud
		to tell you this.
		이 말을
		하게되서 기뻐
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	You don't need
		my help anymore.
		내 도움따윈 더이상
		필요하지 않아
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	In fact...
		사실은...
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:17	I was hoping to present this
		with a cupcake or something.
		컵케익과 함께
		주려고 했는데
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:23	Happy graduation.
		졸업 축하해
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:30	It's beautiful.
		아름다워요
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	It's human bone.
		Oh.
		-사람뼈야
		-오
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	Legend says it was worn
		전설에 의하면
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	by the 2,000-year-old
		witch Qetsiyah,
		2000년살 먹은
		마녀 케시야의 것이래
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	who drew on it...
		그걸 하고 다닌건
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	For strength.
		파워때문이래
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	Bonnie, you have come
		so far so fast.
		보니, 넌 지금까지
		단숨에 해왔어
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	If you trust
		my opinion,
		내 말을 믿는다면
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	your magic is exactly
		where it needs to be.
		네 마법은 필요한곳에
		정확히 사용할 수 있을거야
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:50	Does this mean
		I have to go home?
		이제 집에
		가야되는거에요?
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	It means I got a stack of papers
		I got to grade by tomorrow.
		내일까지 채점해야될
		시험지가 쌓였어
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	I can take a hint.
		힌트라고 생각할게요
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:59	Thanks, Shane.
		고마워요, 쉐인교수님
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:16	Oh, my God.
		맙소사
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	Kol.
		콜이자나
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:21	Shane?
		쉐인?
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:46	I told you I don't
		want to talk.
		 
00:17:46	I told you I don't
		want to talk.
		말하기 싫댔자나
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	I heard. You're
		keeping all that rage
		들었어
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	bottled up inside.
		화를 참고만 있다던데
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	Caroline's worried
		sick about you.
		캐롤라인이 걱정하더라
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	Rebekah?
		레베카야?
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	Hello, Tyler.
		안녕, 타일러
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	I heard my brother made
		a real mess of your life.
		우리 오빠가 네 인생을
		망쳤다고 들었어
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	Believe me, I can relate.
		You have my condolences.
		정말이야 공감해
		애도를 표할게
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	In fact, why don't you come down to the high
		school so you can accept them in person?
		학교와서 직접
		들어보면 어떻겠어?
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	And why would I
		do that?
		왜 내가 그러겠어?
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	Because I have
		your girlfriend.
		여자친구 데리고 있으니가
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	Maybe you have a better shot at
		saving her than you did your mother.
		엄마는 못 구했지만
		이번엔 구할 수 있을지도
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:21	Sister...
		누나...
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	Look at this.
		이거 좀 보게
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	You're even worse
		than Klaus.
		클라우스보다
		더 독하네
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	Kol. Finally.
		콜, 드디어 왔구나
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	Did you bring me
		what I asked for?
		부탁한거
		데리고 왔어?
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:37	You must be Shane.
		네가 쉐인이구나
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:49	If you're here
		for payback, go for it.
		복수하러 온거면
		어서 해
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	But you'll be stuck baby-sitting
		the little hunter that could.
		그럼 여기서 애기 헌터나
		돌봐야되거든
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	You know...
		저기...
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	If you adjust your angle a little
		bit, you'll find a sharper edge.
		각도를 조금 조정하면
		좀 더 날카로울거야
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:02	I know how
		to whittle. Thanks.
		나무 깍는건
		나도 알아, 고마워
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	Now I know why those
		hybrids hated you.
		이제야 하이브리드가
		널 왜 싫어하는지 알겠다
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	You are annoying.
		넌 짜증나거든
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	Actually,
		I'm just perplexed
		사실 좀 당혹스러운데
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	as to why Jeremy hasn't
		killed any vampires.
		제레미가 뱀파이어를
		하나도 안죽여서
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	Darwinism, Klaus.
		다윈설 때문이야
		클라우스
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	He needs to be able
		to protect himself
		스스로는 보호할수
		있어야지
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	before we hunt down
		his first vampire nest.
		뱀파이어 둥지를
		공격하기 전까진
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	And here was I, thinking
		you were the fun brother.
		난 네가 재밌는
		형이라고 생각했는데
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Well, let's play
		a little game, shall we?
		게임 하나 해볼까?
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Jeremy needs more victims,
		and there's a whole town of people
		제레미는 피해자가
		필요하고, 마을에는
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	down the road just waiting to be
		turned into vampires for the slaughter.
		도살당할 뱀파이어가
		되길 기다리는 사람이 널렸어
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	You don't think that
		occurred to me, Klaus?
		그걸 몰랐을 것 같아
		클라우스?
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:31	The tragedy is, Damon,
		비극은 말이야
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	it did occur to you,
		yet you chose to ignore it.
		너도 생각했겠지만
		넌 무시하기로 한거야
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	And my guess is you did it
		to impress Elena.
		엘레나한테 감명을
		주려고 그런것 같은데
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	Somehow, to honor her, you'll
		find a way to spare innocent lives
		어떻게든 그녀를 존중하고
		무고한 목숨을 살릴 방법을 찾았겠지
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	and walk Jeremy down
		the moral high road.
		그리고 제레미도 도덕적인
		삶을 살고 말이야
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:48	That's why I've already made
		the necessary corrections.
		교정이 불가피한지라
		내가 손 좀 썼지
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:53	What did you do?
		뭔 짓 했어?
00:19:55	 
		 
00:20:01	Don't tell me he ordered
		another pizza.
		또 피자
		주문했다고요?
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	No, I'm just an idiot.
		아니요,
		바보같은게
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	I ran out of gas
		and my phone's dead.
		기름도 떨어지고
		핸드폰은 죽었어요
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	Think I could use yours?
		Yeah, come on in.
		-빌려 줄 수 있어요?
		-네 들어오세요
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	I'll run upstairs
		and grab my cell.
		올라가서
		핸드폰 가저올게요
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:15	What the hell?
		뭐야 이게?
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐해요?
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	Car drama.
		자동차 때문에요
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	Your friend just went
		to go get his phone.
		친구분이 핸드폰
		가지고 온댔어요
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	Well, I'm about
		to go take a shower,
		난 이제 샤워할건데
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	but you're more than
		welcome to wait inside.
		들어와서 기다려도
		괜찮아요
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:34	Thanks.
		고마워요
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:41	Kol...
		콜
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	And Rebekah Mikaelson,
		two members of
		레베카 마이클슨
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	the original vampire family.
		This is such a trip.
		오리지널 뱀파이어자나
		완전 망했네
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:49	Where's the cure?
		치료제는 어딨어?
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	Compulsion won't work.
		주술은 안먹혀
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	It's a little trick
		I picked up in Tibet.
		티벳에서
		줏어들은게 있거든
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Right. Well, we'll just have to
		do this the old-fashioned way.
		좋아 그럼
		옛날식으로 해야겠네
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	Beat him until he tells
		you where to find it.
		말할때까지 때려
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:08	Still glued
		to your seats?
		아직도 자리에
		붙어있네?
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	Ooh, it's thick
		with tension in here.
		다들 너무 긴장했어
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:14	Let's spice things
		up a bit.
		흥미좀 돋궈볼까
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:16	Elena, truth or dare?
		엘레나,
		진실 또는 도전?
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	We're done playing your
		stupid games, Rebekah.
		그딴 게임 안해, 레베카
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:21	Truth or dare,
		Elena?
		진실 아님 도전
		엘레나?
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	You're compelled.
		Answer.
		주술 걸렸자나
		대답해
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	Dare.
		도전
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:27	I dare you
		to tell Stefan
		스테판한테
		데이먼에 관한 진실을
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	the truth
		about Damon.
		말할 수 있을려나
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	Seriously?
		진심이야?
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:38	Being with Damon
		makes me happy.
		데이먼과 함께면 행복해
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	Clowns make you happy,
		Elena.
		행복해? 광대도 그래
		엘레나
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	Dig a little deeper.
		좀 더 자세히
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	When I'm with him...
		그와 있으면
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:49	It feels
		unpredictable, like...
		예측이 불가능해
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	Like I'm free.
		자유로운것 처럼
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:57	And how do you feel
		when you're with Stefan?
		스테판과는 어떤대?
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	Stop.
		그만해
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	She can't.
		She's compelled.
		못하지
		주술이 걸렸는데
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	Lately, I feel
		like I'm a project,
		최근에 난 프로젝트가
		된 느낌이었어
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	like I'm a problem
		that needs to be fixed.
		문제가 있어서
		손봐야 하는것 같은거
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:13	I think I make him sad,
		스테판을 불행하게
		만든것 같아
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	and I can't be with
		someone like that
		그런사람과
		함께 할 수 없어
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	because...
		왜냐면...
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:20	When he looks at me, all
		he sees is a broken toy.
		날 볼때면, 고장난
		장난감을 볼 뿐이거든
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:31	Do you still love
		Stefan?
		아직도 스테판 사랑해?
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:34	Yes.
		응
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:38	Are you still
		in love with Stefan?
		스테판을
		연인으로서 사랑해?
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:42	No.
		아니
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:49	Did that hurt,
		아팠어?
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	having someone you love drive
		a dagger through your heart?
		사랑하는 누군가가 심장에
		비수를 꼽았자나?
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:54	Go to hell.
		지옥에나 가
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	Did... that... hurt?
		아 팠 냐 고?
00:22:59	 
		 
00:23:04	Yes.
		응
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:08	Welcome to the last
		900 years of my life.
		내 인생 900년을
		느끼게 된 걸 환영해
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:17	Ah, good, you're here.
		It was just getting depressing.
		아 잘됬다 왔구나
		점점 우울해젔는데
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	What the hell is going on?
		이게 대체 뭐하는거야?
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:22	Listen to the rules
		carefully.
		규칙을 잘 들어
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	Stay in the building.
		No vamp-running in the hallways.
		건물에 있으되, 뱀파이어
		속도로 뛰는건 안돼
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	Vamp-running
		from what?
		뭘 피해서
		뱀파이어 속도로?
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:34	- Turn.
		- What?
		-변신해
		-뭐?
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:36	You can't.
		He'll lose control.
		안돼
		자제하지 못할거야
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	That's the whole point.
		그게 포인트야
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:39	I've exhausted all
		your knowledge.
		너희들한테 배우느라
		진이 다 빠졌거든
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:41	Now I have the Professor
		to help me find the cure,
		치료제를 찾게 도와줄
		교수도 데리고 있으니까
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	you're just competition.
		너희들은
		경쟁상대일뿐이야
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	Whoever finds it first gets
		to decide what to do with it:
		누구든지 치료제를 얻으면
		그걸로 뭘 할지 정하자구
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	Use it, share it,
		destroy it, save it...
		사용하던지 공유하던지
		파괴하던지 저장하던지
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	I want that to be me.
		그게 나였음 좋겠어
00:23:53	 
		 
00:23:53	But if I turn,
		I'll kill them.
		근데 내가 변하면
		쟤들을 죽일텐데
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:56	Yes, you will.
		그래 죽여버려
00:23:58	 
		 
00:24:00	Turn.
		변신해
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:21	Did you find
		your phone?
		핸드폰 찾았어요?
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:28	Get off!
		떨어져
00:24:29	 
		떨어져
00:24:29	Get off!
		떨어져
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:52	Bonnie?
		보니 언니?
00:24:54	Bonnie?
		 
00:24:54	Bonnie?
		다들 여깄는지
		어떻게 알았어요?
00:24:56	Bonnie?
		 
00:24:56	Bonnie?
		모두 여깄다니?
		교수님 찾으러 온건데
00:24:57	Bonnie?
		 
00:24:57	Bonnie?
		GPS 마법 위치 추적
		같은거 한거에요?
00:24:58	 
		GPS 마법 위치 추적
		같은거 한거에요?
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	 
		레베카가 언니
		마녀라고 말해줬어요
00:25:01	Rebekah told me that
		you're a witch.
		레베카가 언니
		마녀라고 말해줬어요
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	Rebekah? What the hell
		is going on?
		레베카라니?
		대체 무슨일이야?
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	Rebekah has Stefan, Elena,
		and Caroline compelled.
		레베카가 스테판 엘레나
		캐롤라인한테 주술을 걸었어요
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	She's getting them to actually
		tell the truth for a change.
		진실을 말하게
		하려고 그랬어요
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:11	What?
		왜요?
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	Shane can't be compelled.
		쉐인은 주술에
		안걸리는데
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:14	She'll have him torture him
		to find out what he knows.
		정보를 캐내려고
		고문을 할거야
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	What are you looking for?
		I need salt.
		-뭐 찾아요?
		-소금이 필요해
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:20	I think I just
		saw some.
		방금 본것 같은데
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:29	What are you doing?
		뭐해요?
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:30	If this pendant will
		connect me to Shane,
		이 목걸이가 교수님이랑
		연결되있으면
00:25:32	 
		 
00:25:32	then I can do
		a protection spell.
		보호마법을 할수 있거든
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:53	Where is the cure?!
		치료제는 어딨어?
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:58	Ohh!
		 
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:00	Where is the cure?
		치료제 어딨어?
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:14	You're human.
		Why do you want it anyway?
		넌 인간이자나
		왜 그걸 원해?
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	That's the beauty
		of this.
		이건 좋아할거야
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	You can have it.
		I just want Silas.
		넌 그걸 가져
		난 사일러스를 원해
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	No.
		안돼
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:23	What do you know
		about Silas?
		사일러스에 대해
		뭘 알아?
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	He's the world's first
		immortal being,
		세상에 나온 첫번째
		불멸의 존재지
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:27	who just happens to be
		imprisoned with the cure.
		치료제와 함께
		갇히게 됬지만
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	And I want to free him.
		내가 풀어줄거야
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:32	No!
		안돼
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:39	April?
		에이프릴?
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:42	What's happening?
		왜그래?
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:52	Stop!
		그만해
00:26:54	 
		 
00:27:02	He's of no use dead.
		죽으면 쓸모없어
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	Did you not hear
		what he said?
		말하는거 못들었어?
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	Silas will kill us
		all, sister.
		사일러스가
		우릴 죽일거야
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:07	Silas does not exist.
		He is a fairy tale
		사일러스는 가짜야
		꾸며낸 얘기야
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	made up to scare children
		into eating their vegetables.
		야채 안먹는 애들을
		겁주려고 만든거라구
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	Silas is very real.
		사일러스는 진짜야
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:16	I know where he's buried,
		어디에 묻힌지 난 알아
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	and soon I'll have
		the spell that wakes him.
		그를 깨울 마법을
		곧 갖게 될거야
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:21	Wait a second.
		You're lying.
		잠깐 거짓말이지
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:22	You can't get to him
		without his...
		사일러스한테 갈 수 없어
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	Tombstone?
		묘석이 없으면
		못가겠지?
00:27:25	 
		묘석이 없으면
		못가겠지?
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	Dozens to die in
		a blood sacrifice?
		피의 제물로
		12명을 죽여야하고?
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:28	Believe me, I know.
		정말이야 나도 알아
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	I've done it.
		그대로 했어
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:32	Those massacres are
		a pain to engineer.
		대학살을 꾸미는데
		애 좀 먹었지
00:27:35	 
		 
00:27:35	You're the one who got
		the council blown up.
		의회사람을 터뜨린게
		바로 너 구나
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:38	It was
		a noble sacrifice...
		숭고한 희생이었어
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	And temporary
		임시로
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	because once
		I raise Silas...
		내가 사일러스를
		일으키면
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	Silas will raise the dead.
		사일러스가 죽은자를
		일으키고
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	He will bring back
		every last soul...
		모든 영혼을
		돌려놓을거야
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	Who died on his behalf.
		자기를 도우려고
		죽었으니까
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	No!
		안돼
00:27:57	 
		 
00:28:03	April, oh, my God!
		 
00:28:03	April, oh, my God!
		맙소사
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:22	Wait.
		I can fight it.
		잠깐 싸워볼게
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:42	Aah! Get out of here!
		여기서 나가
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	Go.
		가
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:49	That door's
		not gonna hold him.
		저 문으론
		막을수 없어
00:28:52	 
		 
00:29:50	 
		나한테 고마워해야지
00:29:50	You should be
		thanking me.
		나한테 고마워해야지
00:29:51	You should be
		thanking me.
		 
00:29:51	You should be
		thanking me.
		치료제를 찾을
		하나뿐인 기회를 죽였어
00:29:51	 
		치료제를 찾을
		하나뿐인 기회를 죽였어
00:29:51	You killed my only chance
		at finding the cure.
		치료제를 찾을
		하나뿐인 기회를 죽였어
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:53	Silas on the loose would
		be hell on earth.
		사일러스가 풀려나면
		지옥이나 마찬가지야
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	And frankly, sister...
		솔직히 말하면 누나...
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	I don't think you
		could handle it.
		누나가 해낼거라
		생각 못했어
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	How did you
		get that?
		어디서 구했어?
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	Way too easily.
		아주 쉽던데
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:41	Bonnie.
		보니
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	Help! Someone help!
		도와주세요
		누가 좀 도와줘요
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:47	Bonnie, what's going on?
		보니 왜그래?
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	She needs help.
		도움이 필요해
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	I did a protection spell,
		but it accidentally linked
		보호 마법을 썼는데
		뜻하지 않게
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	Shane to April.
		쉐인이랑 에이프릴이
		연결됬어
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	And you
		couldn't control it?
		조절할수 없었어?
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	I didn't even know
		I was doing it.
		내가 뭘
		하는지도 몰랐어
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	Usually I feel pain or I
		bleed, but this time I just
		보통 내가 아프고
		피가나는데
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	felt more power.
		근데 이번엔
		더 큰 힘을 느꼈어
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:04	It's ok. It's ok.
		괜찮아
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	You're ok. You're ok.
		You're ok. Ok.
		괜찮아
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	Bonnie, get her out of
		the school.
		보니 애 데리고 가
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:11	Just be careful.
		Tyler is out there, and he turned.
		조심해 타일러가
		변신해서 밖에 있어
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	What about you?
		너희들은?
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:15	No, we can't leave.
		Rebekah's compelled us.
		안돼 우린 못떠나
		레베카가 주술을 걸었어
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	Just go.
		We'll deal with her later.
		어서 가
		레베카는 알아서 할게
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:28	Stefan...
		스테판
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	No.
		됐어
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:31	Stefan, we have to
		talk about this. Please.
		애기를 해야되
		제발
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	Talk about what,
		huh?
		무슨 얘기, 응?
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	How many more ways are there
		for you to rip my heart out?
		얼마나 더 내
		가슴을 찢을려고?
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Sorry that it happened,
		or sorry that I found out?
		이렇게 되서?
		아니면 내가 알아채서?
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	I'm sorry
		about all of it.
		전부 다 미안해
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:44	I'm really sorry, Stefan.
		정말로 미안해 스테판
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:45	I didn't mean to hurt you.
		I didn't want that.
		널 상처주려고 한게 아냐
		그런걸 원하진 않았어
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:52	Why are my least favorite
		people always the most durable?
		내가 좋아하지도 않는 사람은
		왜 항상 오래가는거야?
00:31:56	 
		 
00:32:03	Tyler...
		타일러
00:32:05	 
		 
00:32:26	I'm so sorry.
		미안해
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	It wasn't your fault.
		네 탓이 아니야
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:34	Yes, it was.
		내 탓이야
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	This whole thing.
		전부 다
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	It's all my fault.
		내 잘못이야
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:43	No, Tyler.
		아니야 타일러
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	I should have
		saved her.
		엄마를 구했어야 했는데
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:58	Leave her out of this.
		엘레나는 놔줘
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	This is between
		me and you.
		너랑 내가 해결해야
		할 일이자나
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	You're still
		protecting her?
		아직도 보호하는거야?
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	Must I rip your bleeding
		heart from your chest
		네 상처받은
		심장을 뜯어내서
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:07	and show you the scar tissue
		that is Elena Gilbert?
		엘레나한테
		보여줘야겠네?
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:14	There's
		a solution
		이 문제를 해결할
		방법이 있는데
00:33:15	 
		이 문제를 해결할
		방법이 있는데
00:33:15	to all your
		problems, you know.
		이 문제를 해결할
		방법이 있는데
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:17	I could compel him...
		내가 주술을
		걸 수 있어
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:19	Erase every memory
		he has of you.
		너에 대한 기억을
		모두 지우는거야
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:24	Every day you've
		spent together,
		함께 해온
		모든 날들
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:25	every kiss, every lie,
		every ounce of pain.
		키스, 거짓말들, 고통들
00:33:29	every kiss, every lie,
		every ounce of pain.
		 
00:33:31	 
		 
00:33:31	I can take away every bit
		of love he has for you,
		널 사랑하는 감정도
		뺏어가 줄게
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	give you both
		a clean slate.
		넌 다시
		시작하는거야
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	Just say the word,
		and I'll make you
		말만해
		그렇게 해줄게
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:40	and all that misery you've
		caused him disappear.
		네가 일으킨 고통들은
		전부 사라지는거야
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	Do it.
		그렇게 해
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:47	Excuse me?
		뭐라고?
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:50	Erase it all.
		Every memory.
		지워버려
		기억들 전부
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	Stefan, no.
		스테판 안돼
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	I said do it.
		하라고
00:33:56	 
		 
00:34:04	No. That would be
		far too easy.
		아니, 그럼
		너무 쉽자나
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	I refuse to make
		you forget her
		엘레나를 잊게
		만들지 않을거야
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:11	the way Klaus made you
		forget me.
		클라우스가 날 잊게
		만들었던것 처럼
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:17	But at least you know
		how he really feels.
		다행히 넌 스테판이 어떻게
		느끼는지는 알겠네
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:24	Consider your eternity of
		pain my revenge, Stefan.
		영원토록 고통스러우라고
		주는 내 복수라고 생각해
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:29	I've used you for
		all you're worth.
		그동안 요긴하게
		사용했으니까
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:31	So now you're free to go.
		그러니 이제
		가도 좋아
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:50	Stefan, wait.
		스테판 잠깐만
00:34:52	 
		 
00:35:20	Turns out I miscalculated.
		내가 계산을
		잘못했군
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	Kol's gonna be a problem.
		콜이 문제가 되다니
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	I almost killed someone,
		사람을 죽일뻔 했어요
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	and that's what
		you miscalculated?
		그걸 계산을
		잘못했다 그래요?
00:35:29	 
		그걸 계산을
		잘못했다 그래요?
00:35:29	April could've
		died today.
		그걸 계산을
		잘못했다 그래요?
00:35:29	April could've
		died today.
		 
00:35:29	April could've
		died today.
		에이프릴이 오늘
		죽을뻔 했어요
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	That's only because you didn't
		know the extent of your abilities.
		그건 네 능력이 어느정돈지
		몰라서 그런거뿐이야
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	My father just
		became mayor.
		우리 아빠가
		시장이 되었는데
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:35	I can't be out
		doing black magic.
		사악한 마법을
		할 순 없어요
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	That's not what
		expression is.
		익스프레션은
		그런게 아니야
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:42	Then what is it?
		그럼 뭔데요?
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:44	It's a way of doing magic
		자연이나 영혼의
		감시를 받지 않는 마법이야
00:35:45	 
		자연이나 영혼의
		감시를 받지 않는 마법이야
00:35:45	that isn't monitored by
		nature or the spirits.
		자연이나 영혼의
		감시를 받지 않는 마법이야
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	It isn't good nor bad.
		좋고 나쁜게 없어
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:49	But it also has
		no limits,
		게다가 한계도 없어
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	so how you use it is
		up to you.
		어떻게 사용할지는
		너에게 달렸어
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	That's what
		I'm here for...
		그래서 내가
		여깄는거고
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	To help you.
		널 도와주려고
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	Bonnie, listen to me.
		You are the key to everything.
		보니, 내말 들어
		네가 모든 것의 열쇠야
00:36:04	 
		 
00:36:06	I'm not going to let
		anything bad happen to you.
		너한테 나쁜일이
		생기게 하려는게 아니야
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:27	Hope your day is going
		better than mine.
		나보단 재밌는
		하루를 보냈길 바래
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	Got to say,
		I'm liking the odds.
		내가 이길 확률이
		높다고 해두자
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:32	Stefan knows about us.
		스테판이
		우리에 대해 알아요
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:35	Ooh.
		 
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:38	How'd he take it?
		어떻게 받아들여?
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:40	How do you think?
		어떨것 같아요?
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:43	I'm thinking,
		for the first time all week,
		이번 주 처음으로
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:45	I'm happy to be
		at camp nowhere.
		아무도 없는
		캠핑장이라 기쁘네
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:49	How's Jeremy?
		제레미는 어때요?
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	That depends on
		how much you trust me.
		날 얼마나
		믿느냐에 달렸지
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:54	You know that I trust you.
		내가 믿는거 알자나요
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	Then I think he's gonna get
		through this thing just fine.
		그럼 이번일도
		잘 견뎌낼거야
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	Thanks for looking
		out for him.
		제레미 챙겨줘서
		고마워요
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	Yeah, well,
		I told them if they were good,
		아 저기,
		걔들이 잘하면
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	I'd buy them both ice cream,
		so I got to go.
		내가 둘다 아이스크림
		사준다고 해서 
00:37:08	I'd buy them both ice cream,
		so I got to go.
		 
00:37:08	I'd buy them both ice cream,
		so I got to go.
		이만 가봐야겠어
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	Not yet.
		잠깐만요
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:13	Something happened today.
		오늘 일이 있었는데
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	I realized something
		about you, about us.
		당신에 관해서
		깨달은게 있어요
00:37:19	I realized something
		about you, about us.
		 
00:37:19	I realized something
		about you, about us.
		우리에 대해서요
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	And you can say
		that it's the sire bond,
		주종관계 때문이라고
		말할 수도 있지만
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:23	and you know what?
		Maybe... maybe it is,
		저기 어쩌면
		어쩜 그럴지도 몰라요
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	but I'm telling you
		it's the most real thing
		그치만 정말로
		가장 진실된 것이에요
00:37:30	 
		그치만 정말로
		가장 진실된 것이에요
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:30	 
		내 생애 처음으로
		느껴본것이에요
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:36	I love you, Damon.
		사랑해요 데이먼
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:45	I love you.
		사랑해요
00:37:49	 
		 
00:37:49	Look.
		저기
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	I'm going to get
		this cure for you.
		널 위해서
		치료제를 가저다줄게
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:58	And I'm gonna have to
		do things you don't like.
		네가 좋아하진 않겠지만
		난 해야겠어
00:38:01	 
		 
00:38:01	Damon...
		데이먼
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	But listen carefully.
		잘 들어
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:06	Get in your car
		right now.
		차에 타
		지금 당장
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	Come to me.
		내게 와
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:15	I'll be there soon.
		금방 갈게요
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:31	 
		어서와
00:38:32	You let yourself in.
		어서와
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:33	You called me.
		네가 불렀자나
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	Should I be checking
		for hidden daggers?
		숨겨둔 단검있나
		검사해봐야 되나?
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	Do you still want
		to find the cure?
		아직도 치료제를
		찾고 싶어?
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	More than anything.
		당연하지
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:42	I want to ram it down
		Niklaus' throat
		니콜라우스 목구녕에
		쑤셔넣고
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	and look into his eyes
		as he realizes he's mortal again.
		영원히 살 수 없음을
		알게된 그의 눈을 처다볼거야
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	But Shane's dead
		and you are useless,
		근데 쉐인은 죽었고
		넌 쓸모가 없자나
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	so I'm right back
		where I started.
		그러니 처음으로
		돌아간거자나
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:52	Shane's not dead.
		쉐인은 안죽었어
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:55	But I watched
		Kol impale him.
		그치만 콜이
		찌르는걸 봤는데
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	Well, you probably shouldn't
		have left him alone.
		혼자 놔두질
		말았어야지
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	Bonnie did a little spell.
		보니가 마법을 부렸어
00:39:02	 
		 
00:39:02	He's perfectly fine.
		아주 괜찮아
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:07	You didn't have
		to tell me that.
		그걸 말할 필요는
		없었는데
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:09	Why am I really
		here?
		진짜로 내가 왜
		여기 있는거야?
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:12	You were right.
		네가 맞았어
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	I'm gonna be here
		for an eternity,
		난 영원히
		여기 있겠지
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	and I will go insane
		if I don't know
		그리고 미처버리겠지
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	how Elena truly feels
		about my brother.
		엘레나가 형을 어떻게
		생각하는지 몰랐다면 말이야
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:23	If you really
		want the cure,
		진짜로 치료제를
		원하는거라면
00:39:25	If you really
		want the cure,
		 
00:39:25	If you really
		want the cure,
		쉐인도 꿍꿍이가
		있는거 알아둬
00:39:26	 
		쉐인도 꿍꿍이가
		있는거 알아둬
00:39:26	you should know that
		Shane has an agenda,
		쉐인도 꿍꿍이가
		있는거 알아둬
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	and it's a dark one.
		사악한거야
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:29	He said he organized dozens
		of people to die in sacrifice.
		12명을 제물로
		바치려고 계획했고
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:32	He admitted to the council
		explosion where 12 people died,
		폭발로 죽은 12명이
		자기가 한짓이라고 인정했어
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	and I'm guessing
		it's not a coincidence
		우연은 아닌것 같아
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	that 12 hybrids died at
		the hand of my brother.
		12명의 하이브리드가
		오빠손에 죽은게
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	12...
		12라...
00:39:43	 
		 
00:39:43	Channeling the energy
		from a mass death is used
		많은 사람의 죽음에서
		에너지를 보내는건
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:45	in witchcraft to
		perform dark spells.
		사악한 마법에
		사용되었어
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	It's called expression.
		익스프레션이라고 해
00:39:51	 
		 
00:39:51	Shane admitted
		all this to you?
		전부 쉐인이
		한거라고 인정했어?
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	Proudly.
		자랑스러워 하더라
00:39:55	 
		 
00:39:55	Well, then I guess we'll have
		to figure out how to manage him
		그럼 그를 어떻게
		다룰지 생각해봐야겠네
00:39:57	 
		그럼 그를 어떻게
		다룰지 생각해봐야겠네
00:39:57	while we find the cure
		for ourselves.
		그럼 그를 어떻게
		다룰지 생각해봐야겠네
00:39:57	while we find the cure
		for ourselves.
		 
00:39:57	while we find the cure
		for ourselves.
		그동안 우리는
		치료제를 찾고
00:39:59	 
		 
00:40:01	"We"?
		우리?
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:03	There's no "we,"
		Stefan.
		우리는 없어
		스테판
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	Listen, I hate my brother,
		and you hate yours.
		들어봐 난 우리 형이 싫고
		넌 니네 형이 싫자나
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:08	But Damon's got Jeremy,
		and Klaus has the sword,
		근데 데이먼은 제레미가 있고
		클라우스는 검이 있어
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	and Shane has Bonnie.
		쉐인은 보니를
		가지고 있지
00:40:12	 
		 
00:40:12	You and I are the only ones
		left with nothing.
		아무것도 없는건
		너랑 나뿐이야
00:40:14	 
		 
00:40:14	You said it yourself,
		right?
		네가 직접
		말했자나, 그치?
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:16	Whoever finds
		the cure first
		누구던지 치료제를
		처음 찾는자가
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:18	gets to decide
		what to do with it.
		무엇을 할지
		결정하는거라고
00:40:20	 
		 
00:40:20	What do you say?
		You want to be partners?
		뭐라고 할래?
		파트너가 되줄래?
00:40:25	 
		 
00:40:27	My father had no reason
		to kill 11 people.
		우리 아빠는 11명을
		죽일 이유가 없어요
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:30	He had no reason
		to kill himself.
		스스로 목숨을 끊을
		이유도 없구요
00:40:32	 
		 
00:40:32	He loved me.
		절 사랑했어요
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:34	He loved Mystic Falls.
		미스틱 폴즈를
		사랑했어요
00:40:38	 
		 
00:40:38	He was brainwashed into
		sparking that fire.
		폭발을 일으키라고
		세뇌를 당했어요
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:41	Professor Shane
		organized his death
		쉐인 교수가
		계획한거에요
00:40:44	 
		 
00:40:44	and the 11 others
		who died with him.
		아빠와 11명을
		죽게 한거라구요
00:40:46	 
		 
00:40:49	It's time this entire town
		started telling the truth.
		우리가 진실을 말하게
		할 차례에요
00:40:53	 
		 
00:41:13	I was beginning to worry
		걱정했어
00:41:14	 
		 
00:41:14	you boys wouldn't find
		the place.
		여길 못찾을까봐
00:41:16	 
		 
00:41:16	What the hell...?
		이게 대체...?
00:41:18	 
		 
00:41:18	Did you kill all
		these people?
		여깄는 사람
		다 죽인거에요?
00:41:20	 
		 
00:41:20	Not exactly.
		꼭 그렇지만은 않아
00:41:23	 
		 
00:41:23	They're
		in transition.
		변이중이야
00:41:26	 
		 
00:41:26	Killing them is your job.
		죽이는건
		네가 할일이지
00:41:28	 
		 
00:41:32	You said you were
		going to convince Klaus
		다른 방법이 있다고
		클라우스를 설득한다면서요
00:41:33	 
		다른 방법이 있다고
		클라우스를 설득한다면서요
00:41:33	to do this
		another way.
		다른 방법이 있다고
		클라우스를 설득한다면서요
00:41:35	 
		 
00:41:39	I thought about it.
		생각해봤어
00:41:40	 
		 
00:41:40	And then I realized
		his idea was better.
		근데 쟤 아이디어가
		더 낫겠더라구
00:41:45
