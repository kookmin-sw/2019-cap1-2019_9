00:00:54	Stay where you are and put
		your hands in the air.
		꼼짝말고 손들어.
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:58	My safe.
		Did you open my safe?
		내 금고를 건드린 건가?
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:04	Aah!
		 
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	Stop!
		거기 서!
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:23	Hands behind your back.
		손을 뒤로 돌려!
00:01:25	On your feet now. Get up.
		 
		얌전히 일어나
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:41	Thanks.
		고마워
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	Just a couple bucks, buddy.
		Help a guy out.
		적선 좀 해주쇼
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:46	Just need to know if you saw
		anything, sir, anything at all.
		뭐든지 좋으니 보신게 있다면 말씀해 주십쇼
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:49	Ooh. Ooh.
		오
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:51	Mmm.
		음
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	I don't know.
		모르겠는데
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	Maybe if you tell me
		what you're looking for,
		찾는게 뭔지 말해주면
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	I could help you out.
		훨씬 좋을 것 같은데
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:01	I don't know.
		Loud noise, gunshot.
		총소리 같은 큰 소리가 났고
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	Did you see anyone unusual?
		Anyone acting unusually?
		수상하게 구는 사람은 없었습니까?
00:02:06	 
		 
00:02:06	Maybe I did.
		굳이 있었다면 나일까
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:08	Or...
		아니면
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	Or maybe I didn't.
		내가 아닐수도 있고
00:02:13	 
		 
00:02:13	You give me a couple bucks,
		돈 몇푼만 쥐어주면
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	maybe help me remember better.
		기억이 더 잘 날것 같은데
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:22	You got 2 bucks?
		No. You?
		2달러 있어? - 너는?
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	Looks like a robbery gone bad.
		강도짓을 하려다 망친 모양이에요
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:26	Victim's name was Ted Fisher.
		He owned the place.
		피해자 이름은 테드 피셔 이곳 주인이에요
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:28	Something's off here.
		뭔가 나갔군
00:02:30	 
		 
00:02:30	The alarm was set off
		during the break-in,
		침입 당시 알람은 작동하지 않았고
00:02:32	 
		 
00:02:32	and the killer
		still took the time
		가게를 들쑤시기에 충분한
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	to tear the place apart?
		Watch the blood. Rug's pretty soaked.
		시간을 벌었다 이건가?
		- 피 좀 보세요 카페트가 다 젖었어요
00:02:38	 
		 
00:02:43	And if the killer
		broke the door entering,
		범인이 문을 박차고 들어왔다면
00:02:46	 
		 
00:02:46	why is the victim over here
		with his back turned?
		피해자가 왜 등을 보였던 걸까?
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:49	Something's off here.
		That's very astute, Lisbon.
		뭔가 이상해
		- 예리해, 리스본
00:02:51	There's more here than meets the eye.
		There you are. Where have you been?
		 
		보이는 것 이상의 뭔가 있어
		- 대체 어디 가 있었어?
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54	I haven't been anywhere. I was out back
		checking escape routes. Really? Any clues?
		아무데나 좀 탈출 루트가 어떻게 되나 살펴봤지 
		- 그래? 발견한 건 있고?
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	Only that the murderer didn't
		find what he was looking for.
		범인이 찾던걸 못 찾았다는 것 밖엔
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	And... how do you know that?
		어떻게 알아?
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	Because this whole room
		has been torn apart.
		방안을 엉망진창으로 해 놨잖아
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	You find what you're looking
		for, you stop the search, right?
		찾던 걸 찾으면 뒤지다 말았겠지
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	So part of this room
		would be untouched.
		그럼 어디 멀쩡한 구석이 남아있어야 하는데
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	Unless he found it in the very last
		place he was looking.
		마지막에 찾았는지도 모르죠
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	Do you know the probability
		최후의 순간
00:03:14	of finding something
		in the last possible place?
		 
		찾던걸 찾을 확률이 얼마나 되는지 알아?
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	It's extremely improbable. Hmm.
		거의 제로야
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	I'll see you two back at the office.
		Why are you in a hurry?
		이따 사무실에서 보자
		- 왜 그렇게 서둘러?
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:24	Well, as much as I enjoy these
		lovely surroundings, Lisbon,
		나도 이 로맨틱한 장소에 오래 있고 싶은데
00:03:28	 
		 
00:03:28	we have a job to do.
		우리가 좀 바쁜 사람들이잖아
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	Am I wrong?
		내 말이 틀렸나?
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:35	Bye.
		Bye.
		이따 봐
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:42	Hey, sir. What are you doing
		here so late on a Friday night?
		금요일에 늦게까지 여긴 무슨 일이십니까?
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	My house was burglarized.
		I caught him red-handed.
		누군가 내 집에 침입했네 현행범으로 체포했지
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	Whoa. You want one of my people
		to question him?
		심문할 사람을 보낼까요?
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	No. Sac p.D. Can handle it.
		It's a slam dunk.
		아니, 새크라멘토 경찰이 맡을걸세 금방 끝날거야
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	Come Monday, when court opens,
		월요일에 법원 문만 열었다 하면
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:56	the man who broke into my house
		will be very sorry that he did.
		감히 내 집을 턴 놈은 톡톡히 댓가를 치르게 될거야
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:13	Ah.
		 
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:14	Donny culpepper.
		도니 컬페퍼
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:16	What a surprise
		to see @@/you@@\ here.
		이런 곳에서 볼 줄이야
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	Monday I go before a judge.
		월요일이면 법정행이야
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	You got till then
		to get me outta here.
		그때까지 날 여기서 빼내줘야해
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	Yeah, well, um, that could be
		a little problematic.
		그거 조금 까다로울 수도 있겠어
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	Otherwise I will tell everyone
		그러지 못하면 난 모두에게
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:28	how you hired me
		to rob your boss' house.
		당신이 날 고용해 상사 집을 털게 했다고 실토할거야
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	Well, that's just snitching.
		Isn't that against your...
		치사하게 고자질이라니...
00:04:34	Code of honor?
		 
		직업윤리랑 반하는거 아닌가?
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	No.
		절대
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:52	I paid you very well
		절대로 잡히지 않겠다는 조건으로
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	on the understanding
		that you wouldn't get caught.
		내가 엄청난 돈을 치른걸로 아는데
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	- Did you at least get what I wanted?
		- No.
		최소한 내가 부탁한건 가져왔어?
		- 아니
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:58	I looked everywhere.
		Got into his safe. Nothing.
		전부 뒤져봤어 금고 속도
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	Just some old coins, a watch,
		옛날 동전이랑 시계랑
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	and a tupperware,
		like, tub thing.
		왠 타파웨어 용기밖에 없더군
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	Tupperware. Did laroche say
		anything when he found you?
		타파웨어라니 라로쉬가 당신 체포하고 무슨 말은 없었고?
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	He wanted to know
		if I got into the safe.
		금고를 열었는지 묻더군
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	What'd you tell him? Nothin'.
		I threw somethin' at his head and took off.
		그래서 뭐라고 했는데? 
		- 뭐라긴 아무거나 집어던지고 튀었는걸
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:13	Yeah, you really blew this. I
		thought you were a professional.
		당신 프로인줄 알았는데 이게 뭐야
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	Don't talk down to me.
		If you don't get me outta here,
		내 성질 건들지 마 나 여기서 안 빼주면
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	By Monday, you're the one who's
		gonna have to pay for it.
		월요일에 크게 망할 사람은 내가 아니라 당신일테니까
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	Trust me on that.
		농담 아니라고
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	Trust. Yeah, really off
		on the good foot
		신뢰라, 그래
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	with trust, are we?
		지금 우리 사이에 심각하게 없는 것중 하나지
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	Hi.
		Where are you?
		여보세요
		- 어디야?
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	I thought you wanted
		to get working on this case.
		이번 사건 참여하는 건줄 알았는데
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	I-I do. I just ran
		across the street
		그- 그렇지 지금 밖이야
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	to the, uh, fruit place
		to pick up some fresh fruit.
		거 뭐냐, 과일 좀 사려고
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	Flavonoids...lt's very good
		for logical reasoning
		토마토가 논리적 사고와 기억력 향상에
00:05:40	and visual memory, you know?
		Very interesting. Get here quick.
		 
		그렇게 좋다데 
		- 멋지네 빨랑 돌아와
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	Yep. I'm on my way.
		예입 갑니다
00:05:46	 
		 
00:05:46	The clock's running,
		starting now.
		시간 얼마 없어, 부지런히 움직여
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:53	You close your eyes
		and count to a hundred.
		눈 감고 백까지 세
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:05:58	 
		 
00:06:00	Fisher owned the repair shop
		about a year and a half.
		피셔가 수리점을 운영한건 일년 반 정도
00:06:03	 
		 
00:06:03	Seemed like a good citizen...
		Volunteer work
		착한 사람 같은데요
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	with underprivileged kids
		and the homeless.
		불우청소년과 노숙인들을 위한 자원봉사도 하구요
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	Dig a little deeper.
		더 알아봐
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	Find out what he did before
		he bought the shop. Will do.
		수리점을 열기 전에 뭐 했는지 중심으로
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	Hey, boss. Just talked
		to fisher's girlfriend.
		피셔의 여자친구와 얘기해 봤는데요,
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	She was at the morgue,
		I.D.lng the body.
		공시소에서 시신 확인을 했거든요
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	Kinda upset,
		but she agreed to meet us
		기분이 말이 아닌 것 같긴 한데
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	at the apartment she shared with Fisher.
		All right, let's go.
		피셔와 살던 아파트에 방문하겠다고 했더니 그러래요
		- 좋아, 가보자
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Okay.
		Agent Lisbon, a word?
		리스본 요원 잠시만
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	I just discovered that
		you investigated my burglar
		방금 보니까 일년 전 자네 팀이 내 집을 턴 놈을
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	for a murder about a year ago...
		Donny culpepper.
		살인 혐의로 조사한 적이 있더군 도니 컬페퍼
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	Culpepper? Donny culpepper. I remember him.
		He threatened to kill me.
		컬페퍼요? 
		- 기억나요 날 죽이려 했었죠
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:35	You're gonna have to
		narrow it down
		그러려던 놈이 어디 한둘이어야 기억을 하지
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	a little bit more than that.
		The jewelry store case.
		보석상 사건이요
00:06:39	We picked him up, found him in the hot tub.
		I wonder if there's a connection.
		 
		욕조에 숨어있다 잡혔잖아요 
		- 무슨 연관이 있는게 아닌지 궁금하군
00:06:42	Uh, he's a criminal. He does wrong things.
		Yeah, probably just a coincidence then.
		 
		나쁜 짓을 한 나쁜 놈이지, 더 있나 
		- 그럼 아마 단순 우연이겠네
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	Mm.
		음
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:47	Yeah. Probably.
		아마도
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:51	I'll let you know.
		그냥 알아두라고 한 말이야
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:55	Is there a connection?
		아는거라도?
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	No.
		아니
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	Absolutely not.
		없대도
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:04	Oh, damn. I forgot something.
		Uh, I'll meet you there. Forgot what?
		오, 이런 두고온게 있다 따라갈게
		- 뭔데?
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	Uh, my,
		uh, frumbahollymorgansterning.
		음, 에, 내, 그 거시기 뭐 그런거
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:20	Miss blue?
		블루 양?
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	I'm agent Lisbon.
		리스본 요원입니다
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	This is agent Rigsby. We're
		really sorry for your loss.
		이쪽은 릭스비 요원, 피셔씨 일은 유감입니다
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	Just have
		a couple questions for you.
		질문 몇가지만 드리려구요
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	Okay. Sure.
		그러세요
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	Just a few small things.
		Where were you last night?
		간단한 겁니다 지난밤에 어디 계셨죠?
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	When it happened?
		Um, home, asleep.
		사건 무렵이요? 집에서 잤어요
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	I had the early shift
		at the animal shelter.
		동물 보호소의 주간 당번이었거든요
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	Do you mind if we talk inside?
		안에서 얘기해도 될까요?
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	Okay.
		그러세요
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	Did Mr. Fisher work that late
		very often?
		피셔씨가 늦게까지 일하기가 잦았나요?
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	Sometimes. If he had
		a big project he had to finish.
		가끔요 해야 할 일이 쌓이면요
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	But it's not like work
		was his life or anything.
		워커홀릭은 아니었어요
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	He was in balance.
		쉴때는 쉬는 사람이었죠
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	Right. And, uh,
		how long ago did you meet him?
		만나신지는 얼마나 되셨죠?
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	Um, about a year ago.
		We met at yoga.
		일년 전쯤이요 요가하다 만났어요
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	That's... weird.
		이상하네요
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	I'm sure I locked that.
		분명히 잠갔는데
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	Stand back, ma'am.
		물러서십쇼
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:15	Clear.
		이상 없습니다
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:25	Clear.
		여기도
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	Jane was right.
		제인씨 말이 맞네요
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	Looks like somebody wanted
		something Fisher had.
		누군가 피셔의 물건을 노리고 있어요
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	Call it in.
		Put somebody to watch the shop.
		전화해서 수리점에 사람 보내 지키라고 해
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	If Jane is right, maybe
		they'll go back there.
		제인 말이 맞다면 범인이 돌아올지 몰라
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	Okay, you got it.
		그럴게요
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	I can't believe
		this level of hostility.
		대체 누가 이렇게까지
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	There's nothing here
		worth stealing.
		훔쳐갈 만한건 없었는데요
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	Nothin'?
		아무것도요?
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	Ted and I weren't really
		into material stuff.
		테드와 전 값나가는 물건에 관심이 없었어요
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:46	He spent, like, eight
		years in the peace corps.
		그는 평화봉사단에서 8년간 일했어요
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	Oh, my gosh.
		오 이런
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Oh, excuse me.
		잠시만요
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	I'm sorry.
		Ma'am, can I ask you a question?
		뭣 좀 질문해도 될까요?
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	Oh, I'm sorry.
		I don't mean to be intrusive.
		방해하려는 생각은 아니었어요
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	I live upstairs. There was a break-in here.
		Did you see or hear anything?
		전 윗층 살아요 
		- 여기가 털린 모양인데 뭐 못 보셨어요?
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	No. A break-in?
		I was at the market.
		털렸다구요? 전 시장 보고 있었는데
00:09:05	Did they steal anything?
		 
		뭔가 훔쳐갔대요?
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	Thank you for your time.
		Uh, if you think of anything,
		시간내 주셔서 감사합니다
00:09:09	you can give me a call at this number.
		All right.
		 
		뭐라도 기억나시면 이 번호로 연락주세요
		- 그러죠
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:20	Okay. Thanks.
		고맙습니다
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	Sac p.D. Put a man
		on the store.
		새크라멘토 경찰에서 수리점에 사람 보냈대요
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	Check on the girlfriend.
		여자친구 조사해봐
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	She's got no real alibi
		other than being a hippie.
		히피라는 거 외에 또 수상한건 없는지
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:34	Something bugging you, boss?
		Behind us. Dark late model sedan.
		왜요, 반장님?
		- 우리 뒤에 검은 세단
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	I'm pretty sure I saw it
		outside the repair shop.
		수리점 근처에서 본 기억이 나
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	I think it's following us.
		미행하는 거 같은데
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	Got it.
		받아 적었어요
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:46	And there it goes.
		It's probably nothing.
		그냥 가네요 아무것도 아닌가본데요
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	Just a look-alike.
		보기에는요
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	Maybe. Run the plates.
		See if you find anything.
		어쩌면 차번호 조회해서 나오는거 있나 봐
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:57	Hey.
		이봐요
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	You're new to me.
		Uh, who...Who are you now?
		못 보던 분이네요 누구시죠?
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	Detention enforcement officer
		O'Donnell.
		오도넬 교도관입니다
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	Guarding the prisoner up to
		and until transport.
		이송전까지 범죄자를 감시하는 것을 임무로 하고 있습니다
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	Gung ho. Good to see.
		군기가 바짝 들었네요
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	Well, welcome, O'Donnell.
		반갑습니다 오도넬
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	I'm Patrick Jane.
		I work with the CBI.
		난 CBI에서 일하는 패트릭 제인이에요
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	Okay.
		좋아요
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	No worries. Uh,
		그럼
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	did you...Did you lose this?
		그쪽이 떨어뜨린거 아니에요?
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	A quarter.
		I don't think so.
		동전 
		- 아닌거 같은데요
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	Well, it's less of a quarter,
		몇푼 안되지만
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	more of a good luck piece,
		really.
		느낌이 좋은 동전인데요
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	I mean, take a closer look.
		가까이 한번 봐요
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Look at the way
		the light hits it.
		반사광이 어떤가
00:10:31	Shines and gleams,
		 
		반짝 반짝 빛나면서,
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	like liquid sunshine.
		햇살이 물처럼 녹아 내리는것 같죠
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	Keep looking at it.
		눈을 떼지 마요
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	It's kind of soothing
		the way it shines, isn't it?
		반짝반짝하는게 왠지 마음이 편안해지죠
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	You can feel your worries
		and responsibilities
		마음 속 모든 걱정과 부담이
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	just... fading away.
		씻겨 내려가는 기분이죠
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	You might even want
		to close your eyes
		어쩌면 살며시 눈을 감고
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	and just have a little sleep.
		잠을 청하고 싶을지 몰라요
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:52	My Uncle had a buffalo nickel.
		저희 삼촌도 희귀 동전을 갖고 있었죠
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	He was always gonna sell it
		and buy a ranch and all that,
		그걸 팔아 목장을 사고 싶다고 입버릇처럼 말씀하셨는데
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	but he lost it in a poker game.
		포커하다 잃었대요
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	So not yours, huh?
		아, 그래서 그쪽 건 아니고?
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	No. Maybe check upstairs.
		위에 올라가 물어보세요
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	Will do. Thank you.
		그러죠, 고마워요
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:11	I checked up on the girlfriend.
		She seems clean.
		여자친구 조사를 해봤는데 깨끗합니다
00:11:12	No priors, committed pacifist.
		 
		전과도 없고 반전주의 운동가고
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	People I talked to say she and
		Fisher were close.
		피셔와는 사이가 좋았다고 하구요
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	All right.
		Let's keep an eye on her, though.
		그래도 계속 주시해
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	Okay. Hey. I pulled a message
		off the victim's cell phone.
		피해자 전화기에서 메시지를 추출했습니다
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	Think you wanna hear it.
		들어보셔야 할 것 같은데요
00:11:22	Fisher, you dog! You think you
		 
		[피셔, 이 개자식!]
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	can get away with this? I find
		you, Fisher! You're gonna pay
		[그냥 내뺄 수 있을거라 생각했냐!]
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	@@/for what you done!@@\
		You hear me, Fisher?! You pay!
		[널 찾아 반드시 댓가를 치르게 할 것이다! 반드시!]
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	He doesn't sound very happy.
		화가 엄청 났네요
00:11:33	What's the accent? I sent a copy down
		to Pete in forensics. He can tell us.
		 
		이건 어디 액센트야?
		- 카피 떠서 법의학자한테 보냈으니 답이 오겠죠
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	He's a genius with accents.
		What time did the call come in?
		액센트엔 빠삭하거든요 
		- 이게 언제 걸려온거야?
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	11:45 last night. Coroner puts time of
		death between 11:00 and 2:00. Bingo.
		어젯밤 11시 45분입니다 
		- 검시관 추정 시각이 11시에서 이튿날 2시까지니 딱이군
00:11:42	Maybe. I'm working on
		getting the subscriber info
		 
		그럼 발신번호 가입자 정보를
00:11:44	for the number from
		the phone company right now.
		 
		이통사에 요청하겠습니다
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	Good. Oh, boss, one more thing.
		I've been looking into
		좋아 
		- 한가지 더요
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Fisher's past and hit a snag with the
		peace corps thing. What kind of snag?
		피셔 과거를 캐다가 문제가 생겼어요
		- 무슨 문제?
00:11:52	Well, they've got no record
		of Fisher being a member
		 
		피셔가 일했다던 평화봉사단에
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	going back ten years.
		I'm having them check to see
		피셔 기록이 없어요
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	if it could be a clerical error
		or spelling mistake.
		서류상 미스가 아니냐고 확인해 달라고 했어요
00:12:00	Talk to the girlfriend.
		Find out where he was stationed. All right.
		 
		여자 친구한테 자세히 물어봐
		- 알겠습니다
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	Are you taking a vacation
		from this case or what?
		이 사건에선 아예 손 떼기로 한거야 뭐야?
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	Huh? No.
		나? 아닌데
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	Boss. I put the license
		우릴 미행하던 차의
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	of the car that you thought was
		following us in the system.
		번호 조회 결과가 나왔습니다
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	It was rented from the airport
		three days ago.
		3일전 공항에서 렌트해간 차래요
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	Corporate account to some
		shell company I couldn't track.
		추적이 불가능한 유령회사 명의에요
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	I just got a fresh hit. The car
		was ticketed a half-hour ago
		그 차가 한시간 반 전 쯤에 피해자 수리점 근처에서
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	just two blocks away from the
		victim's repair shop. Nice. Let's go.
		딱지를 떼였대요
		- 오케이, 가자
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	You coming or what?
		같이 갈거야?
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	Are those bulletproof vests?
		그거 혹시 방탄조끼?
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Yeah.
		Uh, think not.
		맞아
		- 안 가는게 좋겠다
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	Good luck.
		Okay.
		행운을 빌어
00:12:35	 
		 
00:13:03	No light.
		불 꺼주세요
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:27	Locked.
		잠겼어요
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:49	Freeze!
		꼼짝마라!
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	Drop your weapons!
		Put your hands on your heads!
		무기를 내려놓고 손들어!
00:13:54	 
		 
00:14:17	Okay.
		어디 보자
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	So yesterday
		you were bumming change.
		어제는 한푼만 적선해 달라더니
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Here you are today
		with a $1,000 handgun,
		오늘은 멋지게 관리된
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	nicely maintained.
		천달러짜리 핸드건을 가지고 있군요
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	You can understand
		our puzzlement.
		이쯤 되면 상당히 문제가 많죠?
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:31	Sir, my name is Cole ruger.
		내 이름은 콜 루거입니다
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	I have a license for that
		and a carry permit.
		총기 소지 허가를 갖고 있소
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	Okay, Mr. ruger,
		좋아요, 루거씨
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	what do you know about the
		death of Ted Fisher? Nothing.
		테드 피셔의 죽음에 관해 아는게 있습니까?
		- 없습니다
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	Fisher was a buddy of mine.
		That's all.
		피셔는 내 친구였소 그게 다요
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	You and he were
		in the peace corps together?
		같이 평화봉사단에 계셨나요?
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	Hmm. No.
		아니오
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	We worked at sagaris together.
		sagaris에서 같이 일했습니다
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	What is sagaris?
		sagaris가 뭔데요?
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	A security firm.
		경호회삽니다
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	We provide services
		우리는
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	the regular army
		isn't equipped for.
		정규군 대신 치안을 제공하는 일을 하죠
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	Wait.
		잠깐
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	You and Fisher
		were mercenaries?
		테드피셔와 당신이 용병이라는 겁니까?
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	Private security contractors.
		사설 무장 경호원이죠
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:08	Where did you do
		most of your contracting?
		보통은 어디서 활동하셨는데요?
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	All over. Mostly Iraq.
		Fallujah, Basra.
		아무데서나 대개는 이라크였습니다 팔루자나 바스라
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	Where were you
		when Fisher was killed?
		피셔가 죽을때 어디 계셨습니까?
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	Ted called me two days ago
		and said he was in trouble.
		이틀전 내게 전화해 문제가 생겼다더군요
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:21	He needed help.
		Whatever it was,
		도와달라고
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	he couldn't say it over the phone.
		And you just dropped everything,
		그게 뭔지는 전화로 얘기하지 않았습니다 
		- 그래서 아무것도 묻지 않고
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	no questions asked,
		headed here?
		만사제치고 여기 오셨다?
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	That's right. Wouldn't you?
		당신이라면 어땠겠습니까?
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	Where were you coming from?
		어디서 오셨습니까?
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	I was overseas.
		그땐 국외였습니다
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	What did Fisher tell you
		when you got here?
		당신이 오고서는 피셔씨가 뭐라던가요?
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	Nothing.
		아무것도
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	He was already dead.
		이미 죽어 있었습니다
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	I was too late.
		내가 너무 늦었지요
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	At which point you disguised
		yourself as a homeless man
		그럼 노숙자로 변장해
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	to get close to the crime scene.
		사건 현장을 어슬렁거린건 뭡니까?
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	I was trying to gather intel,
		figure out who killed Ted.
		누가 테드를 죽였는지 알아내려 했습니다
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	Which is why you broke into his store
		with a loaded handgun?
		장전된 핸드건을 가지고 건물에 침입한 것도 그래서인가요?
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	I was staking out the place.
		수리점을 감시중이었습니다
00:15:55	I heard a noise inside. The back
		door was open. I went in.
		 
		안에서 소리가 들렸고 문이 열려 있길래 들어갔죠
00:15:59	 
		 
00:15:59	I encountered that woman.
		She was armed.
		여자가 총을 가지고 있더군요
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:01	So I drew my weapon. Like I
		said, it's fully licensed,
		나도 내 무기를 꺼낸거죠 말했다시피 허가받은 총기입니다
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	and I have a carry permit.
		나도 총기면허가 있구요
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	Look...
		이봐요
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	Agent,
		I wanna work with you guys
		나도 당신네들 도와서
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	to find out who killed Ted.
		누가 테드를 죽였는지 알아내고 싶습니다
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	Whatever I can do. So as soon as
		you cut me loose... Cut you loose?
		그러니 내가 여기 나가기 전에 협조를
		- 나가요?
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	Sure.
		그럼요
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:21	I haven't committed a crime.
		난 범죄를 저지른 적도 없는데요
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	Or should I call my attorney?
		아니면 내가 변호사를 불러야겠습니까?
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:31	Okay. Obviously, you're
		not the victim's neighbor,
		확실히 그쪽이 피해자 이웃은 아니시죠
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	and I need you to explain this.
		설명 좀 해 주셔야겠네요
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	My name is Vivian griswold.
		내 이름은 Vivian griswold
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	I had nothing to do with
		the murder of Ted Fisher.
		테드 피셔 죽음과는 아무 상관 없어요
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	A client hired me six months ago
		to observe Mr. Fisher.
		6개월전 테드 피셔를 감시하라고 고용됐어요
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	What kind of client?
		What exactly do you do?
		고용주가 누군데요? 하시는 일이 뭡니까?
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	I work for a company
		providing corporate intelligence
		우리 회사는 기업 상대로 보안 서비스를 제공하거나
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	and covert surveillance.
		첩보활동을 지원하죠
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	A private sector spy.
		Who's the client?
		사설 스파이 같은거네요 누가 당신을 고용했죠?
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	Mm.
		Can't tell you that.
		음, 그건 말할 수 없어요
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:01	What I @@/can@@\ tell you is that
		it involved a major theft
		내가 말해줄 수 있는건
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	from my clients, overseas,
		내 국외 고객의 소유물이
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	two years ago.
		2년전 도난당했다는 거예요
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	And Fisher was connected how?
		He was a person of interest.
		피셔는 어떤 식으로 관계된거죠?
		- 용의자였죠
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	Mr. Fisher left his job
		조사가 시작되자마자
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	shortly after an investigation
		was launched.
		일을 버리고 떠났으니까
00:17:16	His reasons for leaving
		were... questionable.
		 
		갑자기 일을 그만둔 이유가 수상했어요
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	You said you had Fisher
		under surveillance.
		테드 피셔를 감시하셨다고 했는데
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	So... where were you
		the night of his death?
		피셔가 죽던 날엔 어디 가 계셨어요?
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	I had information
		that led me to believe
		피셔가 다른 장소에 있다는
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	that Mr. Fisher would be
		at a different location.
		제보를 받았어요
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:28	Obviously,
		that was bad information.
		완전 틀린 정보였지만요
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	I guess.
		그러게요
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	So... how did you come to be
		in Fisher's locked shop
		왜 총을 가지고
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	carrying a weapon?
		잠긴 건물에 침입하셨죠?
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	I was surveilling the shop
		when I heard a noise inside.
		건물을 감시하다 안에서 소리를 들었어요
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	The back door was open,
		and I went in.
		뒷문이 열려있어 들어갔습니다
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	Finding an armed man inside,
		무장한 남자가 있길래
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	I drew my fully licensed
		and permitted weapon.
		내 허가받은 총기를 꺼내든거죠
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	That's all.
		그게 다예요
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	Now... my lawyer is already
		on the way over,
		내 변호사가 한참 오는 중인데,
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	but wouldn't we all rather
		skip the formalities?
		본론부터 얘기하는게 어때요?
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:04	You getting anything?
		뭐 좀 알겠어?
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	Well, they're
		both professional liars.
		둘다 거짓말의 프로군
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	Beyond that, I can't read either of them.
		They're both good for the murder,
		그 밖엔 모르겠어 
		- 둘 다 살인에 능하고
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	so each gives the other
		reasonable doubt.
		때문에 양쪽 모두가 의심돼
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	We need to come at this
		from another angle.
		다른 각도에서 볼 필요가 있겠어
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	Just got off the
		phone with Pete in forensics.
		법의학팀에서 전화입니다
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	He says the accent's Iraqi,
		probably from Baghdad.
		이라크, 아마도 바그다드 억양인것 같다더군요
00:18:23	Any luck tracking down the caller?
		Prepaid cell phone. No subscriber info.
		 
		발신자 추적됐어?
		- 선불폰이라 불가능합니다
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	I tried calling it, but the
		minutes must be up. Great.
		역으로 전화를 걸어보려는데 몇분 걸릴 겁니다
		- 알았어
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:33	Agent Lisbon.
		리스본 요원
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	I just got a call from the state
		department about your case.
		국무부에서 자네 사건 관련으로 전화가 왔네
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	What should I know? The state department?
		What'd they say?
		내가 알아야 할게 있나? 
		- 국무부라뇨? 뭐라던데요?
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	Our victim, Fisher, was
		suspected of getting too close
		우리 피해자 피셔가
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	to shady Iraqi businessmen.
		수상한 이라크 국적 사업가와 긴밀하게 지냈다고 하더군
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	A theft may have occurred.
		그리고 도난 사건이 있었다고
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	Nothing could ever be proven.
		현재로선 아무것도 분명한게 없지만
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:51	They would like to be kept
		abreast of developments.
		조사가 진척되는대로 상황을 알려달라했네
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	We've got a threatening call
		아마도 이라크인일수 있는 사람에게서
00:18:54	from somebody
		who may or may not be Iraqi
		 
		협박전화를 받았고
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	and two suspects in holding
		방첩 분야 경력이 있는
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	who've got experience
		with counterintelligence.
		용의자 두 명을 잡았습니다
00:19:00	And you have strong leads?
		 
		그래서?
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	Something for me
		to tell Washington?
		워싱턴에 보고할만한게 있나?
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Nothing concrete, sir.
		뾰족한 건 없습니다
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	Early indicators say
		that it's revenge
		조심스레 생각하기론
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	for whatever happened in Iraq.
		Hmm.
		이라크에서 벌어진 일의 복수가 아닌가 싶습니다
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	What about you, Mr. Jane?
		제인씨 생각은 어떠신지?
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	What dazzling insights
		have you gleaned?
		항상 뛰어난 직관을 보여줬잖소
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Uh, I've got nothing.
		없는데요
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	Hmm. That's disappointing.
		그거 실망스럽군
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	Off your game somehow? Distracted?
		Mnh. No, not at all.
		컨디션 난조인가? 신경쓰이는 일이라도? 
		- 전혀요
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Sorry to interrupt, boss,
		but I just talked
		방해해 죄송합니다만,
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	to the girlfriend, Heather blue.
		She's frightened.
		피셔 여자친구, 헤더 블루가 전화했습니다
00:19:27	Says someone is prowling around her apartment.
		Let's go and see her.
		 
		누군가 집근처를 돌아다닌답니다
		- 가서 만나보지
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	I wanna ask her about
		that peace corps thing anyway.
		평화봉사단 일도 물어봐야 하니까
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	Jane, are you co...
		Damn. Problem?
		제인, 혹시 같이 갈... 이런 제길 
		- 문제라도?
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	Not at all, sir.
		아닙니다
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	Keep me informed.
		Okay.
		계속 알려주게
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	These people are lying to you.
		그 사람들이 거짓말하는 거예요
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	Teddy was in the peace corps.
		I told you that.
		테디는 평화봉사단에 있었어요
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	We checked.
		저희가 알아봤습니다
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	Ted Fisher worked
		for sagaris private defense
		테드피셔는 경호회사에서
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	from 2000 to 2009,
		2000년부터 2009년까지 일한게 맞습니다
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	since he first got out
		of the army. He was a mercenary.
		제대한뒤 줄곧요 용병이었던 것 같습니다
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:53	No. He wasn't.
		아니에요
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	Not possible.
		그럴리 없어요
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	Heather, you called us here
		because somebody frightened you.
		헤더, 누군가 근처에 있다고 하셨죠
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	Oh, well, uh...
		아 그건
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	Yeah, I was watching tv
		when I heard the noise.
		tv를 보는데 소리가 들렸어요
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	He was trying
		to come in the back,
		뒷문으로 들어오려고 하길래
00:20:08	but when I yelled, he ran.
		Did you get a look at him?
		 
		소리질렀더니 도망쳤어요
		- 모습을 보셨나요?
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	No, I just saw the glint
		방충망을 찢을때
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	of the knife he was using
		to cut the screen.
		칼날밖에 못 봤어요
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	You can't remember anything else
		about him? Size? Hair color?
		몸집이나 머리 색깔 같은건요?
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	Um, uh, he was wearing
		a hooded sweatshirt, I think.
		후드티를 입고 있었어요
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	A little taller than me, maybe.
		저보다 키가 컸구요
00:20:22	Are you sure it was male?
		Could it have been a woman?
		 
		남자인건 확실합니까? 여자일 가능성은요?
00:20:25	I don't know. Maybe. God, my
		heart's going a mile a minute.
		 
		모르겠어요 너무 겁이 나고 당황해서...
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	We've assigned you
		a protection detail.
		경비를 붙여드리죠
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	Nobody's gonna hurt you.
		아무 일 없을 겁니다
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	You really want me
		to believe Ted lied to me?
		테드가 정말 제게 거짓말을 한 건가요?
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	The whole time,
		he was lying to me?
		함께한 시간 내내요?
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	I'm sorry.
		죄송합니다
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:52	O'Donnell. How goes it?
		오도넬, 좀 어때요?
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	Fine. As long
		as they keep bringing food
		몇시간마다 먹을걸 내려보내주는 한엔
00:20:57	every couple hours, I'm good. Yeah.
		Well, I brought you a chair.
		 
		문제 없습니다 
		- 의자를 가져왔어요
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	Just opens up, and...
		당겨 열면 돼요
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	There.
		Great.
		고맙습니다
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	Yeah, it's my pleasure.
		뭐 사소한 걸 가지고
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	Just glad to know we got
		a good man like you on the job.
		당신처럼 좋은 분과 일해서 기쁘군요
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	Just and ease your way into it. That's...
		Just ease your way down.
		편한가 보세요
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	Okay. There we go.
		Uh, yeah.
		괜찮아요?
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:16	Okay, fantastic.
		Um, I'll check on you later on. Okay.
		좋네요
		- 나중에 또 내려올게요
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:21	Thanks.
		감사합니다
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:31	Whoever was trying
		to get into the apartment,
		누가 헤더 집에 침입하려 했든간에
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:33	it wasn't ruger or griswold.
		ruger나 griswold는 아냐
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:35	They were only released an hour ago.
		겨우 한시간 전에 풀려났는걸
00:21:36	Well, maybe they have someone
		else working with them,
		 
		동료가 있다거나
00:21:38	@@/or@@\ the girlfriend is
		having some very bad dreams.
		 
		그 여자분이 그냥 나쁜 꿈을 꿨나보지
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	Okay.
		Do you have any intention
		대체 너 이 사건
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	of actually taking part
		in this case?
		같이 하겠다는 의지가 있는거야?
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	It's all under control.
		열심히 하고 있는데
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	Wait.
		You know who the killer is?
		범인이 누군지 알겠어?
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:52	The what?
		뭐?
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:54	Oh, the killer.
		No. No, I misspoke.
		아, 범인 말이군
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	What's going on with you?
		대체 왜 이러냐?
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:58	You've been acting strange
		since this case started.
		이 사건 시작하고부터 이상하게 굴잖아
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	Strange.
		Strange how?
		이상하게 어떻게?
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	Strange like...
		이런거?
00:22:04	Or...
		 
		아니면
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:06	Boss, Rigsby's...
		반장님, 릭스비가
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	Got something.
		뭔가 찾아냈답니다
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:12	Oh. Just got a call from
		the guys in evidence.
		저번 그 남자로부터 전화가 왔어요
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	Fisher's phone's was ringing.
		It's been going off every half-hour.
		30분마다 전화가 걸려옵니다
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	Where did the call come from?
		Same number... Prepaid cell phone.
		어디서 오는건데? 
		- 선불폰이고 계속 같은 번호예요
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	I thought you said the cell phone angle was dead.
		He must've put more minutes on it.
		그 선불폰 다한거 아니었나
		- 몇분 추가했나보죠
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:29	This is Cho.
		Yeah, we're all set here.
		조입니다 여긴 준비 됐습니다
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:31	How are you guys coming along?
		어떻게 하면 됩니까?
00:22:33	Cho's talking to the phone company
		so that when the call
		 
		전화가 걸려오면
00:22:35	comes through, we can
		triangulate off the cell towers,
		 
		발신지가 어딘지 삼각측량으로 알아내기로
00:22:37	figure out exactly where the call came from.
		 
		이통사랑 얘기해 놨어요
00:22:39	Okay, I need
		you to keep him on the phone
		 
		좋아, 얘기하면서
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	for at least two minutes.
		Hi. This is Patrick Jane.
		최소한 2분은 시간을 벌어보세요
		- 패트릭 제인입니다
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:45	Listen, I know who you are. (Middle eastern
		accent) Shut up! I am coming to get you.
		당신 누군지 압니다 
		[닥쳐! 네놈 목을 가지러 가겠다]
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	I don't know who you are,
		but I will make you pay for this!
		[네가 누군진 상관없고 댓가를 치르게 해주겠다!]
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	No, you shut up. You listen to me.
		아니, 당신이나 닥치고 잘 들어
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	I know what you want. The only
		way you're gonna get it is
		뭘 원하는지 알고 있다
00:22:55	if you meet me in person.
		We got something to settle here.
		 
		하지만 직접 만나야만 줄 수 있어 우리 사이 해결할게 있잖아
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	Outside the repair shop
		in one hour. You be there,
		원하는 걸 갖고 싶거든
00:23:02	you get what you want.
		If you don't,
		 
		한시간 뒤 수리점 밖에서 보자 만약 나타나지 않으면 국물도 없는 줄 알아
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	you'll never see it again.
		Simple as that. What was that?
		내 말은 여기까지다
		- 뭡니까?
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:07	I said 2 minutes.
		That was hardly 30 seconds.
		2분이랬더니 30초도 될까말까잖아요
00:23:08	Well, I just thought it'd be simpler
		to bring him to us.
		 
		직접 나타나게 하는 편이 쉽잖아
00:23:10	It's okay. Thank me later.
		 
		감사의 말은 나중에 듣기로 하지
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	Now the strangeness we were talking about...
		Never mind.
		아깐 내가 뭐 이상하게 군다고... 
		- 잊어 버려
00:23:16	 
		 
00:23:16	Okay.
		그래
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:57	Uhh! Oh!
		 
00:23:59	 
		 
00:23:59	Hey!
		 
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:02	Hey! Don't...
		이거 놔!
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	Where
		is that bastard Fisher? No!
		피셔 개자식은 어딨나!
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:07	Let me go!
		Where is that bastard Fisher?
		이거 놔라! 피셔 놈은 어딨냐고!
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:24	My name is Omar Hassan.
		내 이름은 오마르 핫산
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	Okay. Why were you so angry
		with Ted Fisher?
		좋습니다 테드 피셔와는 무슨 일이 있는 겁니까?
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	My father worked
		for the Americans,
		우리 아버지는 미국을 도와
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	helping to establish
		a free and Democratic Iraq.
		자유 민주 이라크를 세우려 하셨다
00:24:36	 
		 
00:24:36	He and Fisher worked together.
		피셔가 아버지와 같이 일했군요
00:24:38	 
		 
00:24:39	Yes.
		그렇다
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	Before my father was killed.
		우리 아버지가 살해되기 전까지는
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:42	How'd he die?
		어떻게?
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	Bomb, two years ago.
		2년전, 폭탄으로
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	Fisher was involved
		in his death?
		피셔가 아버지 죽음과 관련이 있습니까?
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	No, but when it became clear
		아니,
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	that my father's life
		was in danger,
		하지만 아버지 목숨이 위태로워지자
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:54	Fisher promised he would
		take care of my family
		피셔는 아버지에게 무슨 일이 생기든
00:24:56	 
		 
00:24:56	if anything happened
		to my father.
		우리 가족을 보호하겠다고 약속했다
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	And Fisher told you this?
		당신에게 그랬습니까?
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	After my father was killed,
		Fisher quit his job.
		우리 아버지가 죽고 피셔는 용병을 그만뒀다
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	He...He wanted
		no more of killing.
		더 이상 살인하고 싶지 않다고 했다
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	He promised to help
		get us to America
		우리 가족을 책임지고
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	and that the $2 million
		미국으로 데려오기로 했다
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:15	would be waiting for us when we arrived.
		That's a lot of money.
		그래서 피셔에게 2백만 달러를 주어 먼저 보냈다
		- 엄청난 돈이군요
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	The state department
		thinks Fisher was engaged
		국무부는 피셔가 이라크에서
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	in criminal activity in Iraq. Is
		that where the money came from?
		범죄행위에 연루되었다고 보고 있습니다 돈의 출처가 그겁니까?
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	No. It came from my father.
		It was our family fortune.
		아니, 그것은 우리 아버지 돈이다
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	Your father put a lot of trust
		in Fisher.
		피셔를 몹시 신뢰했군요
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	He believed he was a good man.
		아버지는 피셔를 좋아했다
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:34	He...
		He stayed under our roof.
		피셔는 우리와 같이 살았고
00:25:37	 
		 
00:25:37	He...
		He broke bread with us.
		동고동락했었다
00:25:40	 
		 
00:25:40	So Fisher helped
		그럼 피셔가
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:41	to get the visas necessary
		to come to America,
		미국으로 올 수 있게 비자 문제를 도와줬겠고
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:43	and your family arrived
		four days ago. Is that correct?
		그래서 가족이 4일전 미국으로 건너왔죠, 맞습니까?
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	And what happened
		when you met up with Fisher?
		피셔를 만나고 무슨 일이 있었습니까?
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	We were supposed to meet
		two nights ago,
		우리는 이틀전 만나기로 되어 있었지만
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	but he never showed up.
		피셔는 나타나지 않았다
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:53	You thought
		he double-crossed you,
		이중첩자 노릇으로 당신네 돈을 가로챘다 생각했군요
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:55	that he stole the money,
		and that's why
		그래서 방충망을 찢고
00:25:57	 
		 
00:25:57	you cut the screen and tried
		to break into the apartment.
		아파트로 침입하려 한거고
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:01	Yes.
		그렇다
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:04	What about Fisher's friend,
		Cole ruger?
		피셔 친구인 콜 루거를 압니까?
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:09	Did you ever meet him or did
		Fisher ever talk about him?
		만났거나 피셔가 언급하는 것을 들었습니까?
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	No, I-I don't know him.
		나는 그를 모른다
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:17	What am I to tell my mother?
		이제 어머니에겐 뭐라고 해야 좋은가?
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	My sisters?
		내 누이들에게는?
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:24	I mean, we have nothing now.
		이제 내겐 아무것도 남지 않았다
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	Yeah. It's a tough break.
		운이 나빴군요
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:33	I'll be right back.
		곧 돌아오죠
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	The kid doesn't seem
		like a killer.
		저 애가 범인같진 않아
00:26:38	 
		 
00:26:38	I'm not sure the revenge
		motive works. Mm.
		복수 동기가 맞는지 모르겠어
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:41	What are you doing? What is that?
		None of your business.
		뭐하고 있어? 그게 뭐야?
		- 신경 꺼줘
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	Are you even listening to me? Every word.
		Let's go catch this killer, shall we?
		내 말 듣고 있기나 한거야? 
		- 빠짐없이 이제 범인을 잡으러 가볼까?
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	How are we gonna do that? The killer was
		looking for the Hassan family's $2 million.
		어떻게?
		- 범인은 핫산 일가의 2백만 달러를 노리고 있지
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	The rest is easy.
		나머지는 쉬워
00:26:52	The rest is easy.
		 
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:57	 
		이제 나더러 네 멋진 계획이 뭐냐고
00:26:58	And now you want me to ask you
		what the plan you worked out is,
		이제 나더러 네 멋진 계획이 뭐냐고
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:00	don't you? No.
		I just want you to round everyone up
		물어봐 달라는 거지? 
		- 아니, 그 대신 전부 연락해서
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	and get 'em to the repair shop.
		Everyone? Who's everyone?
		수리점으로 모아줘 
		- 전부라니 누굴?
00:27:05	Uh, well, let me see. There's
		the girlfriend and Omar there
		 
		보자, 여자친구랑 저기 오마르
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	and, uh, griswold and ruger.
		I think that about covers it.
		griswold와 ruger도, 그 정도
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:11	Ruger and griswold...
		They've already been released.
		이미 풀려났잖아
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:13	And from what I've seen
		of the two of them,
		그리고 두사람 경력으로 볼때
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	we're not really equipped to track 'em down.
		Oh, no. It's gonna be easy.
		추적하기도 쉽지 않아 
		- 아니, 어렵지 않아
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	Easy? Ruger bought a plane ticket
		out of the country... Mm-hmm.
		쉬워? 루거는 여길 벗어나자마자
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:21	The second he left the CBI.
		Griswold disappeared
		국외로 가는 항공표를 끊었어 griswold도 우리 미행을 따돌려 버렸고
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	even after we put a tail on her.
		Ruger is not leaving the country.
		루거는 아직 여기 있어
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:27	He is after the money.
		You heard Omar.
		돈을 찾아야 하거든 오마르 얘기 들었잖아
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	He'd never even heard of ruger.
		오마르는 루거를 본 적도 없어
00:27:31	 
		 
00:27:31	Ruger worked with Fisher, but I bet
		they weren't friends. And griswold?
		루거가 피셔와 일한건 사실이지만 친구관계는 아닐테지 
		- griswold는?
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:34	Well, she's after the money,
		too. I expect they're both
		그 여자도 돈 때문이야
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	trying to get into
		the repair shop as we speak.
		그래서 부득불 수리점에 침입한거지
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	You just have to round them up.
		Call me if you need any help.
		일단 모아놔 내 도움 필요하면 전화하고
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	Wait a minute.
		You're leaving again?
		잠깐, 어딜 또 가?
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:43	What is going on with you?
		When have I ever steered you wrong before?
		대체 뭘 잘못 먹었어? 
		- 내 말대로 해서 언제 틀린적 있나?
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	I mean, when have I ever
		really steered you wrong
		내 말대로 해서
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	where I've done something
		that didn't work out
		어디 생각대로 되지 않은 적이
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	the way we wanted it to?
		Seriously?
		단 한번이라도 있었냔 말이야
		- 솔직히 까볼까?
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Okay, fine.
		Let me put it this way...
		알았어 그럼 이건 어때
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:58	When have I ever
		intentionally screwed things up
		내가 한번이라도 의도적으로 일을 꼬아서 사건을 망쳐놓은 적이 있었어?
00:28:01	 
		 
00:28:01	so that we couldn't solve the case?
		No. Not that I know of, at least.
		내가 알기론 없지 여태까진
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	Uh, that's right. Thank you.
		Have a little faith, Lisbon.
		바로 그거야, 이런 고마울데가 나를 조금만 더 믿어봐, 리스본
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:11	Okay, Jane said
		they're here somewhere.
		좋아, 제인씨 말론 모두 근처에 있을거래
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:15	Let's take a look.
		한번 봅시다
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:22	Probably not the homeless guy.
		저 노숙자는 제외
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	No, ruger tried that one before.
		루거가 한번 써먹은 수법이니까
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	How about the food guys?
		노점상은?
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:30	No, too short.
		키가 작아
00:28:32	 
		 
00:28:34	How about the truck?
		트럭?
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	That's it.
		Yep.
		저거다
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	Hey, guys, I got this.
		Yes, you do.
		내가 할게요
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	Hmm.
		 
00:28:43	 
		 
00:29:01	What do you want?
		원하는게 뭡니까?
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	I'm not breaking any laws.
		난 아무것도 위반한게 없는데
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	We just wanted to
		ask you into the repair shop.
		수리점으로 일단 좀 오시죠
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:08	It would be a big help for us.
		저희에게 큰 도움이 될 겁니다
00:29:12	 
		 
00:29:15	All right. No problem.
		그러죠
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:22	Very nice.
		정말 감사합니다
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	One down, one to go.
		하난 처치했고
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:30	See anything?
		뭐 보여?
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:31	Nope.
		아무것도
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:44	Cho, how's it going?
		We found ruger in a delivery van,
		[조, 어떻게 되어가?]
		- 배달 트럭에서 루거를 찾았습니다
00:29:47	 
		 
00:29:47	but griswold's nowhere in sight.
		Are you near the repair shop?
		griswold는 안 보이는군요
		- 수리점 근처야?
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	Yeah, right out front.
		바로 앞입니다
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:51	Okay, from where you stand,
		what is the best vantage point
		좋아, 서 있는 곳에서 가게를 저격하기 최선의 장소를 찾아봐
00:29:54	 
		 
00:29:54	to see the shop? He wants us to
		look for the best observation post
		[가게를 감시할 수 있는
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:58	for watching the shop.
		최적의 장소를 찾아보라는군]
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:02	How about way over there?
		That building
		저거 어때?
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	right across the street? There's a building
		across the street. Rooftop's good.
		길 건너 건물? 
		- 길 건너 건물이 있는데 옥상이 쓸만합니다
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	Do you have a pen and some paper?
		펜하고 종이 있어?
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	What's up?
		뭐야?
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	What are you doing?
		뭔데?
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	Throw me a pen.
		펜 좀 줘
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	A pen?
		Yeah.
		펜?
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:22	Nice catch.
		참 잘 받네
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	Horrible throw.
		 
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	You're welcome.
		 
00:30:28	 
		 
00:30:36	Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
		이거 장난하나 
		[Griswold 내려와라 수리점에서 만나자]
00:30:39	 
		 
00:31:02	Hey, O'Donnell, snack break.
		오도넬, 간식 시간이야
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	Oh, thanks, buddy.
		No problem.
		고마워
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	It's about time.
		더 빨리 올걸
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	Mmm.
		 
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	Turkey.
		칠면조라
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:22	Oh!
		 
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:46	Look, you gotta put this on.
		We don't have a lot of time.
		얼른 줏어 입어 시간이 별로 없으니까
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	You're gonna use this
		to get out through the door.
		보안을 통과할땐 이걸 쓰고
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:59	Wait. What are you talking about?
		Well, you asked me to get you out of here.
		잠깐, 뭐하자는 거야? 
		- 내보내달라며
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	That's what I'm doing...Helping you escape.
		Now hurry up. Escape? I'm not escaping.
		그래서 지금 탈출을 도와주는 중이지 어서 서두르라구 
		- 탈출이라니? 그런건 안해
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	You think I want to spend
		the rest of my life on the run?
		남은 평생 수배자로 살라고?
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:09	No. You get the charges dropped.
		That's the deal.
		내 혐의를 벗겨줘야 돼 그게 계약 조건이야
00:32:11	Hey, whoa, whoa.
		I'm not a lawyer.
		 
		이 사람 좀 보게 내가 변호사야?
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:14	I can't make charges
		just disappear,
		내가 혐의를 그냥 세탁해줄 순 없지
00:32:15	but I can get you to Mexico...
		 
		하지만 대신 정착자금을 조금 쥐여서
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:17	Set you up with a little starter money.
		멕시코로 빼내줄 순 있지
00:32:19	Mexico? Who the hell wants
		to go to Mexico?
		 
		멕시코? 그딴델 누가 간대?
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:22	What? You get me out free and
		legal, or I start talking.
		합법적으로 빼내주지 않으면 모두 불어버릴거야
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:24	I'm pretty sure the dirt
		I got on you will be worth
		내 진술의 파장을 감안하면
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:27	a "get out of jail free" card.
		You're very annoying.
		내가 혐의를 벗을 수 있게 애써야 할걸 
		- 당신 진짜 사람 애먹이는구만
		- 시간 없대도
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:32	Mm.
		 
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:43	Are they the ones?
		저 사람들인가?
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	Are you going to arrest them?
		저 사람들을 체포할 건가?
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	Oh, hi. You must be Heather.
		Thanks for coming by.
		그쪽이 헤더군요 와줘서 고마워요
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:52	Ted Fisher was a good man
		테드 피셔는 핫산 일가와의 약속을 지킨
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	who kept trust
		with the Hassan family.
		훌륭한 사람이었습니다
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	He was murdered over $2 million,
		which is somewhere in this room.
		여기 어딘가 있는 2백만 달러 때문에 살해당했죠
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	$2 million?
		2백만?
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	Ted didn't have $2 million.
		테드는 그런 돈 없어요
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	Uh, yes he did.
		They could tell you.
		있었답니다 저 사람들이 말해줄 거예요
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:07	How do you know it's in this room?
		Because we've checked every other location
		그게 이 방에 있는지 어떻게 알아요? 
		- 피셔와 관련된 곳을 모두 뒤졌으니까요 당신도 역시 그랬고
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:11	connected to Fisher and so have you.
		That's why you're here.
		그래서 여기 계시는거 아닙니까
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	- Hasn't this room already been searched,
		이 방이라면 범인도 경찰도
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	both by the killer and by the police?
		- Yes, but they...I'm sorry...
		한번씩 뒤져본게 아닌가요? 
		- 하지만 말입니다...
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	Weren't creative enough.
		보고도 놓친거죠
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	It could be in bearer bonds
		hidden in the bills
		그건 증권이나
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:24	or invoices or files
		운송장, 파일
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:25	or more likely,
		in the form of jewels
		혹은 이 전자장비들 어딘가
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:27	hidden somewhere inside
		these electronics.
		박혀있는 보석일지도 모릅니다
00:33:31	 
		 
00:33:31	Whatever form it's in,
		we're gonna find it right now.
		그게 뭐든간에 지금 찾아낼 겁니다
00:33:34	 
		 
00:33:34	Come on in, folks. These people
		are gonna take everything
		들어들 오세요 저 사람들이 세간을 전부 갖고나가
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:38	and pull it apart until
		they find the hidden treasure.
		숨겨진 보물을 찾을때까지 하나하나 분해할 겁니다
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	Yes, piece by piece,
		찾던 게 나올때까지
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	until we find it.
		조각조각 말이죠
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	Thank you, folks.
		If everybody could just step outside
		그럼 이 분들이 일하시게
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	and let these people do their jobs.
		Thanks. (Jane) Thank you.
		우리는 자리를 비켜 줍시다
00:33:53	 
		 
00:34:10	They didn't find anything.
		아무것도 안 나왔어
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	No cash, no jewels,
		no bonds. Nothin'.
		현금도 보석도 증권도 아무것도
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	Huh.
		What am I going to do?
		어떡해야 하나?
00:34:18	 
		 
00:34:20	My family is ruined.
		우리 일가는 망했어
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:23	All my father did
		was for nothing.
		우리 아버지가 하신 일이 물거품이 되어버렸어
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:29	What a waste of time.
		완전한 시간 낭비로군
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	I'd agree with him, except it's
		this kind of incompetence
		맞는 말이야, 이렇게들 무능하니
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	that makes people pay @@/me@@\
		to produce results.
		사람들이 날 찾아 부탁하지
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	Hmm.
		 
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:46	These people
		have all been lying to you.
		전부 거짓말장이예요
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:49	I was right about Teddy.
		나는 테디를 잘 알아요
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:52	You were wrong.
		당신이 틀렸어요
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:55	Aha. I figured it out.
		알겠다
00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:58	I know exactly
		where the fortune is.
		보물이 어딨는지 알겠습니다
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:02	Oh, ho!
		 
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:15	Where is it then?
		어딨어요?
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	Where's the money?
		어딨다는 거예요?
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:22	You're on top of it.
		바로 위에 서 계십니다
00:35:25	 
		 
00:35:25	Under the carpet?
		카페트 아래에 있단 거예요?
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	No. It @@/is@@\ the carpet.
		Touch it.
		바로 카페트입니다 만져봐요
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	Pure silk, hand-knotted.
		손으로 짠 100퍼센트 실크입니다
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:34	It looks like
		a dirty old carpet.
		더럽고 낡은 카페트로만 보이는데
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	Oh, yes, it's very old. One
		of the reasons it's so valuable.
		굉장히 낡았죠 그래서 비싼거지만
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	Wow.
		I gotta phone this in.
		찾아냈다고 전화해야겠군요
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	Stop.
		잠깐
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	Let's talk about this.
		우리 얘기 좀 해요
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	If you did call it in,
		그 전화 하고,
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:51	the legal mess will
		take forever to sort out.
		이어 법적인 문제를 해결하려면 천년만년 걸려요
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:53	This carpet will just end up in
		a government locker somewhere.
		그 동안 카페트는 어디 창고에서 썩겠죠
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	Yeah, probably.
		아마 그럴겁니다만
00:35:59	 
		 
00:35:59	What if we just...
		아니면 우리
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:02	Took it?
		가질래요?
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:05	You and me?
		당신하고 나
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:10	We took the carpet,
		카페트를 슬쩍해서,
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:12	sold it, and divided
		the profits between us?
		팔아치우고 돈을 갈라 가지자?
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	Exactly.
		그래요
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:22	Hmm.
		 
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	That's, uh...
		그거 참
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:29	That's a great idea.
		좋은 생각입니다
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	Isn't it?
		50/50 split?
		그렇죠? 
		- 반반?
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	Sure. 50/50.
		그래요 반반
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:35	Deal. What did Ted say when you
		suggested that deal to him?
		딜
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:43	Ted was a softheaded fool.
		테드는 이럴때 뭐라던가요?
		- 테드는 멍청했어요
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	Aha. So you knew
		about the money.
		돈에 대해 알고 계셨구만
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:49	You knew Ted wasn't
		with the peace corps.
		테드가 평화봉사단원이 아니란 것도 알았고
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:51	You knew everything.
		I didn't...I didn't say that.
		전부 알고 계셨군요
		- 난 그런 말 안했어요
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	Oh, yes you did,
		다 하신겁니다
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	which means, Heather,
		it was you that shot Ted.
		즉 헤더, 당신이 테드를 쏴죽인 겁니다
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:58	He told you about his identity,
		he told you about the money,
		테드는 자기 정체와 돈에 관해 털어놓았고
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:02	and you shot him for it.
		No. Uh, that's...No!
		당신은 그를 쏴죽였죠
		- 아니야!
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	Well, forgive me if I, uh,
		I'm not quite convinced.
		미안하지만, 전혀 아닌거 같지 않은데요
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:08	But I do have to phone this in.
		일단 전화부터 해야겠군요
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	Lisbon'll be very happy to know...
		Stop.
		리스본이 들으면 좋아할 
		- 멈춰
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:13	Are you pointing a gun at me,
		Heather?
		지금 총으로 나 겨눈거예요, 헤더?
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:15	The man I loved was
		in the peace corps.
		내가 사랑한 남잔 평화봉사단원이었어
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	He wanted to make the world
		a better place.
		세상을 더 좋은 곳으로 만드려고 애쓴 사람
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	Ted wasn't who he said he was.
		테드는 그런 사람이 아니었어
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:23	He was a soldier, a killer.
		테드는 군인, 살인자였어
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	So you shot him? That's a little
		counterintuitive. He lied to me!
		그래서 쐈다구요? 어처구니가 없어서 
		- 그는 내게 거짓말을 했어!
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:28	This had nothing to do
		with the $2 million?
		정말 2백만 달러랑은 아무 상관 없구요?
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	You can't understand.
		You can only see things
		당신은 이해 못해
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:34	from your bourgeois
		capitalist mindset.
		부르조아지의 자본주의적 사고방식으로만 세상을 볼테니
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:36	Do you know how much good
		could be done with $2 million?!
		2백만 달러면 어떤 일을 할 수 있는지 알아?
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:38	How many animals could be saved?!
		얼마나 많은 동물을 구할 수 있는지 알아?
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:40	But you couldn't find the money.
		The clock was ticking.
		하지만 돈은 어디에도 없었죠 시간이 없는데
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:43	You looked everywhere,
		and you couldn't find it.
		전부 뒤져봤지만 찾아내지 못했죠
00:37:45	He caught me
		searching the shop.
		 
		가게를 뒤지다 그에게 걸렸어
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	He talked to me like
		I was some kind of criminal.
		날 무슨 범죄자 취급을 했지
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	Well, uh,
		pretty much what you are.
		누가 봐도 그거니까요
00:37:53	 
		 
00:37:53	No. I'm blessed is
		what I am.
		아니, 나는 축복받은 사람이야
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	The universe wants me
		to have this money.
		대우주의 의지가 그 돈을 가지라고 허락했어
00:37:58	 
		 
00:37:58	I'm sorry I have to kill you,
		당신을 죽여서 미안해
00:38:01	 
		 
00:38:01	but I'm doing it
		from a place of love.
		하지만 사랑으로 가득찬 세상을 위해서야
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	Drop the gun. Put your hands on your head.
		무기 내려놓고 손을 머리 위로 올려
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:07	Oh, wow.
		 
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	(Whispers) I'm
		gonna leave you with that.
		대신 처리 좀 해줘
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:22	Huh.
		흠
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:24	You were right about ruger
		and griswold.
		ruger와 griswold 관해서 네 말이 맞았어
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	He's already disappeared,
		and she's admitted
		루거는 자취를 감췄고
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:28	she was working
		for the state department,
		여잔 피셔를 밀수범으로 지목한 국무부를 위해
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	who suspected Fisher
		of smuggling and theft.
		일하고 있었다고 시인했지
00:38:31	But they've agreed to recognize
		 
		그러나 둘다 카페트의 주인이
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:33	the Hassan family's right
		to the rug,
		핫산 일가라는데 합의했어
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	so everything ends happily.
		아름답게 끝났지
00:38:37	 
		 
00:38:37	Mm. Good.
		잘됐네
00:38:39	 
		 
00:38:39	I waited for you to tell
		the hassans. Come on.
		가서 핫산 일가한테 뭐라고 해
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:42	Oh, no, thanks.
		괜찮아
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	What do you mean, "no, thanks"?
		Well, uh, you know,
		괜찮다니 무슨 뜻이야? 
		- 왜 이래
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	I don't have time
		for that kind of treacle.
		그런 오글거리는 건 질색이라고
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	I have to rearrange
		my sock drawer.
		그러느니 양말 서랍을 정리하겠어
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:54	I have a serious problem
		I have to solve,
		해결해야 할 골치아픈 문제가 있는데
00:38:57	 
		 
00:38:57	and I don't have a lot of time
		to solve it in.
		시간이 별로 없는 상태야
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	I knew something
		was going on with you.
		뭔가 미심쩍다는건 예전에 알았어
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:04	What is it?
		뭐야?
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:09	The absolute truth,
		or I beat it outta you.
		백퍼센트 사실을 말해 아니면 두들겨 맞을 줄 알아
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:13	Laroche has something I need,
		so I hired culpepper
		라로쉬에게 내가 원하는 물건이 있어서
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:16	to break into laroche's house.
		컬페퍼를 고용해 라로쉬 집을 털게 시켰어
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	If I can't get
		the charges dropped,
		혐의를 못 벗기면
00:39:20	culpepper is gonna tell on me.
		 
		컬페퍼가 내 이름을 실토하겠대
00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:24	Oh... my God.
		이럴 수가 있나
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:26	Yeah, it's not good.
		그렇지 안 좋지
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	What does laroche have
		that you want?
		라로쉬가 뭘 가졌길래?
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:33	Hightower
		didn't murder anybody.
		하이타워는 아무도 죽이지 않았어
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	She was framed.
		모함 받은거지
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:37	Red John has
		a friend inside the CBI.
		CBI 내부에 레드존의 사람이 있어
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	The Todd Johnson murder.
		토드 존슨을 죽인
00:39:41	 
		 
00:39:42	Laroche had a short list of
		suspects that led to hightower.
		라로쉬가 하이타워 외 용의자 명단을 갖고 있으니
00:39:44	 
		 
00:39:45	That's what you were
		trying to steal...The list.
		그 명단을 훔치려 했구나
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:47	Yes. There were four names on
		that list besides hightower's.
		그래 하이타워 말고도 네 사람의 이름이 더 있을거야
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:50	One of them is working for red John.
		Did you ask laroche?
		레드존의 끄나풀은 그 중의 하나야
		- 라로쉬하곤 얘기해 봤어?
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	Laroche? No. Because if
		it's not one of those names,
		라로쉬? 결코 만약 넷중 하나가 아니면
00:39:57	 
		 
00:39:57	then laroche is red John's man.
		Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?
		라로쉬야말로 레드존의 한패니까 
		- 왜 이런걸 진작 말하지 않았어?
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:00	I don't want to put you
		in danger.
		네가 위험해질까봐
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:03	You're an idiot.
		I will fix this,
		이런 바보를 봤나 내가 해결할게
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	but we are gonna have a serious talk after.
		Fix it? I've been trying to fix it all weekend.
		하지만 넌 나랑 아주 심각한 토크를 하게 될 줄 알아 
		- 나도 이번주 내내 해결하려 애쓴걸 네가?
00:40:10	 
		 
00:40:10	I had the perfect escape
		worked out,
		내가 완벽한 탈출을 구상해줬더니만
00:40:12	and then culpepper says, "no, I want the
		charges dropped"" yeah, yeah. Let's go.
		 
		컬페퍼가 한단 소린 고작 '내 혐의를 벗겨줘'라며 
		- 알았어, 일단 가자
00:40:17	 
		 
00:40:22	Open it up.
		열어요
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:24	He's in there with his lawyer,
		변호사와 함께 있습니다
00:40:26	 
		 
00:40:26	perfect.
		잘됐구만
00:40:27	 
		 
00:40:36	Okay. I can get behind that.
		오 여형사라
00:40:39	 
		 
00:40:39	A dumb cop who's pretty is better
		than a dumb cop...
		알겠구만 똑같이 멍청한 경찰 가운데도 예쁜 편이 그렇지 않은...
00:40:42	 
		 
00:40:42	- Oh!
		- What do you think you're doing here?!
		대체 뭐하시는 겁니까?
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:45	You...You can't do that.
		이러시면 안되죠! 이건 명백한 절차위반으로 혐의를 백지화할
00:40:46	 
		이러시면 안되죠! 이건 명백한 절차위반으로 혐의를 백지화할
00:40:46	Oh.
		이러시면 안되죠! 이건 명백한 절차위반으로 혐의를 백지화할
00:40:47	 
		이러시면 안되죠! 이건 명백한 절차위반으로 혐의를 백지화할
00:40:49	Oh.
		이러시면 안되죠! 이건 명백한 절차위반으로 혐의를 백지화할
00:40:51	 
		이러시면 안되죠! 이건 명백한 절차위반으로 혐의를 백지화할
00:40:53	 
		 
00:41:05	Due to your actions,
		a criminal is going free.
		대체 무슨 생각 하고 다니나? 자네 행동으로 범죄자가 풀려났네
00:41:09	 
		 
00:41:09	I'm sorry, sir.
		The frustrations of the job...
		죄송합니다 이 일이 스트레스를 많이 주는 일이다보니
00:41:13	 
		 
00:41:13	Your apologies
		are of no import, agent.
		자네 사과는 필요없네, 요원
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:15	Donald culpepper can no longer
		be brought to trial.
		도널드 컬페퍼를 법정에 세울수 없게 됐단 말이야
00:41:18	 
		 
00:41:18	Well, hang on. He didn't
		actually steal anything, did he?
		잠시만요, 그렇다고 실제 훔친것도 없잖아요?
00:41:21	 
		 
00:41:23	The 1-week suspension is
		mandatory.
		1주간 정직
00:41:26

		of anger management classes.
		그리고 반년간 분노 조절 코스를 수강하게
00:41:30	 
		 
00:41:30	Ohh!
		 
00:41:32	 
		 
00:41:32	Yes, sir.
		알겠습니다
00:41:34	 
		 
00:41:37	Mm.
		I thought that went well.
		어떻게 잘 지나갔네
00:41:40	 
		 
00:41:40	You're gonna owe me big-time.
		나한테 엄청 빚진거 알지
00:41:42	 
		 
00:41:42	Uh, for what exactly?
		뭐에 대한 무슨 빚?
00:41:44	 
		 
00:41:44	Or I will...
		아니면...
00:41:46	 
		 
00:41:46	Uh. Ah. Two words...
		Anger management.
