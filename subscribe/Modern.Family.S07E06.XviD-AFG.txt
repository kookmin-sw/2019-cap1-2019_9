00:00:14	I, uh...
		I lovingly nursed them,
		제가, 제가.. 
		사랑으로 녀석들을 돌봤구요

		그런데, 무슨 운명의 장난인지
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	Claire was the only one there
		when the ducks were born,
		오리들이 태어날 때 
		클레어만 집에 있었어요
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	so they imprinted on her.
		그래서 클레어에게 각인해버렸어요
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	Oh, I didn't do it on purpose.
		아 일부러 그런 건 아니야
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	- Then make them come back to me.
		- Mm.
		그럼 돌려주든가

		옆에 가서 버거랑 맥주 한잔 할래?
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	- Well, I --
		- I definitely do.
		- 글쎄, 난..
		- 완전 좋아
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	That movie brought up
		so much for me.
		저 영화 여운이 너무 남아
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	Plus, I got to take my pill
		with food.
		밥먹고 약도 먹어야 하고
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	- Yeah, I'm not so sure --
		- You're coming.
		- 그게 난 잘..
		- 가자
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	- Oh.
		- Maybe if you're there,
		너희들 있으면
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	he won't try and do
		his adorable British character
		앤디가 영국인 흉내내는 거
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	for the hostess.
		좀 자제해줄지도 모르지
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	Will you put this
		in my veggie burger
		이거 내 야채버거에 넣고
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	and not tell me where it is?
		어디있는지 알려주지 말아
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:50	Hey, Lloyd, it's your dad,
		A.K.A. your worst nightmare.
		헤이, 로이드, 네 아빠다
		혹은 네 악몽이지
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Just reminding you
		the duck village
		그 오리 마을말야
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	needs to be clean enough
		to eat off of.
		식탁으로 쓸 만큼 깨끗하게 하라고
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	You hear me?
		You better not have.
		듣고 있니?
		안 듣는게 좋을거야
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	You're not allowed to
		use your phone.
		너 폰 사용 금지니까
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Yep, I'm everywhere.
		늘 지켜보고 있다
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	You think maybe you're being
		a bit hard on Luke?
		루크한테 조금 심한 거 같지 않아?
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	We're his parents, Claire.
		우린 걔 부모야, 클레어
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:06	It's our job to keep him off
		the stripper pole.
		스트립쇼 무대 근처에
		못 가게 하는 게 임무라구
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	I actually like that he's being
		a little bit rebellious.
		그게 난 루크가 
		반항적으로 구는 게 싫지 않아
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	Sometimes, between the magic
		and the trampolining,
		그 마술이나 트램플린 하다가
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	I think he's getting a little...
		You know.
		루크가 가끔은 약간..
		알지
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	What are you trying to say,
		Claire?
		무슨 말을 하고 싶은 거야, 
		클레어?
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:18	A little... me?
		약간.. 나?
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	There it was again,
		또 이거에요
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	the insinuation that I'm not
		dangerous enough for her.
		내가 그다지 위험한 남자가 아니라는
		암시를 하는 거에요
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	Apparently, she's forgotten
		I've been to jail.
		클레어가 잊은 것 같은데
		저 감옥에 간 적 있습니다
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	I once led 20 violent inmates
		in a therapeutic tumbling class.
		폭력적인 수감자 20명에게
		치료용 텀블링을 가르치러 갔었죠
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	It was a huge success.
		대성공이었어요
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	Could I have made
		the participation trophies
		참가상을 조금 덜 날카롭게
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	a little less stabby?
		만들었어야 할까요?
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	Sure.
		그럴지도요
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	But overall, a huge success.
		하지만 전체적으로,
		대성공이었죠
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	When you say you're happy
		about Luke being a rebel,
		당신 루크가 반항아처럼 구는게
		맘에 든다고 할 때면
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	it sounds a little like
		you're also saying...
		꼭 이렇게 말하는 것처럼 들..
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	Are you wearing my perfume?
		당신 내 향수 뿌렸어?
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:45	- It was to trick the ducks.
		- Oh.
		오리들 속이려고 그런거야
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:47	But like I was saying --
		그런데 내 말대로-
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	Hey, is that Alex?
		잠깐, 저기 알렉스야?
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:50	It is. That's weird.
		그러네 이상하다
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	She said she was gonna be
		at school all weekend studying.
		주말 내내 학교에서
		공부할 거라고 했는데
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	 
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:55	Hello?
		여보세요?
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	- Hey, honey. - Hi! I'm here, too.
		How are you doing, honey?
		- 여보세요 
		- 엄마도 있어. 잘 지내니, 아가?
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	Oh, yeah, I'm good. I'm doing
		some work. Really busy.
		아 네, 잘 지내요
		뭐 좀 하느라요 엄청 바빠요
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	Well, that's interesting, be--
		흠, 그거 참 이상하네, 왜-
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	Yeah, we've got a boring day
		ahead of us, too.
		그래, 여기도 진짜 지루하다
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	Heading down to the impound lot
		to pick up the car
		차가 견인되서 가지러 가는 길이야
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	because, yes, your brother
		got arrested last night.
		네 동생이 그래, 어젯밤에 체포돼서 말야
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	Oh! Okay.
		Well, that's great.
		오! 그래요
		잘 됐네요
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	Yeah, I really got to go.
		I left my stuff in the library.
		저, 이제 가봐야돼요
		도서관에 짐을 놔두고 와서요
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	And I'm really worried
		someone's gonna steal my snacks.
		누가 내 간식 훔쳐갈까봐 걱정되네요
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	Okay, bye!
		끊어요!
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	Why did you stop me?
		I was gonna bust her.
		왜 방해한거야?
		딱 걸렸는데
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	What? In a little lie?
		I mean, come on.
		거짓말 좀 했다고? 좀 봐줘
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	She's probably visiting a friend
		친구집에 놀러온 걸거야
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	and she didn't want to
		hurt our feelings.
		우리가 기분 상할까봐 말 안 한거구
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	She barely reacted when she
		heard that Luke got arrested.
		루크가 체포됐다는 말 듣고도
		아무 반응도 없었잖아
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	She's obviously
		hiding something.
		뭔갈 숨기는 게 분명해
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	And now she's walking
		into that liquor store.
		그리고 이제 주류판매점에 가네
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	Oh, no. Oh, no.
		Now, this is serious.
		오, 안돼. 세상에,
		이거 정말 심각하네
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	A college student is visiting a
		friend, and they're buying beer!
		대학생이 친구집에, 맥주를 사들고 가다니!
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	Relax, Phil.
		좀 진정해, 필
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:40	This girl has two patents.
		쟤 특허(patent)가 두 개 있는 애라구
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	What she needs is two parents.
		부모(parent)가 두 명 있어야지
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	OK, my point is it wouldn't
		hurt Alex to loosen up.
		그래, 내 말은 알렉스가
		긴장을 좀 풀어도 된다는 거야
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	I mean, I'm worried that
		she's getting a little...
		난 걱정 돼. 쟤가 약간...
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	There it is again.
		또 이거야
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	Just say it, Claire --
		그냥 말해, 클레어
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	You like our kids running wild
		우리 애들이 제멋대로 설치고 다녔으면 싶지?
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:54	'cause you're worried
		they're too much
		왜냐면 애들이 자기 아빠처럼
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	like their
		namby-pamby dad,
		소심소심하고
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	Mr. Goody-Goody,
		Mayor of Vanillatown.
		성인군자 동화나라 시장님
		될까봐 걱정된다고
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Is this 'cause
		the ducks like me better?
		오리들이 날 더 좋아해서 이러는 거야?
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	That is biological,
		and you know it.
		그건 생물학적인 거야, 알잖아
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	There are videos of them online
		오리들이 진공청소기 따라다니는 
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	following around
		a vacuum cleaner.
		영상도 인터넷에 있거든
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:06	They're basically idiots!
		걔네들은 기본적으로 멍청하다고!
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	Oh, my god. Hang on.
		She's getting into that van.
		맙소사, 잠깐만
		쟤 저 차 타려는 거야?
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	- Oh, now we're concerned!
		- Yes, I'm concerned!
		- 오, 이제 걱정하는 거야
		- 그래, 걱정한다!
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	That is a sketchy repair van
		대충 수리한 밴에
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	that is probably being driven
		by some middle-aged pervert
		온라인에서 만난 중년 변태남이
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	with one long fingernail
		that she met online.
		한쪽 손톱만 길게해가지고는
		타고 있는게 틀림없어
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	Oh, my god, go! Follow them!
		맙소사, 가! 따라가!!
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	 
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:20	Thank you for lending us
		Manny's easel.
		매니 이젤 빌려줘서 고마워요
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	Did everyone love the sauce?
		사람들이 소스 좋아하던가요?
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	Well, if by "everyone"
		you mean a thousand bees
		글쎄요, 벌 수천마리랑
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	and a pony that escaped
		from the riding circle, yeah.
		무리에서 도망친 조랑말은 좋아하던데요
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	Oh, no --
		Is this one of those
		아, 안돼
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	video wills where you make us
		compete in a scavenger hunt
		아빠 유산걸고 보물찾기하라는
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	for your inheritance?
		영상 유언장 찍는 거에요?
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	No. It's the video for my Titan Award.
		I told you about it.
		아니. 내 거인상에 쓸 영상이야
		얘기했잖아
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:37	I'm trying to project
		strength and confidence.
		내 강함과 자신감을 담으려고 하고 있다고
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	Maybe you should lose the
		Garfield "I hate Mondays" mug
		저 가필드 "월요일 싫어"
		머그잔부터 치우시는 게 어때요
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	- on the mantel.
		- Good catch.
		- 벽난로에요
		- 잘 잡아냈어
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	I've waited my whole life
		to hear you say those words.
		그 말 듣는 거 평생 소원이었는데
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	- Want to help me out here?
		- Yeah.
		- 좀 도와줄래?
		- 네
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	I needed the distraction.
		환기가 좀 필요했어요
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	I had spent enough of my day
		사이먼이 말한 일자리 때문에
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	obsessing over
		Simon's job offer.
		종일 머리속이 복잡했거든요
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Plus, I don't know...
		seing my big, strong dad
		게다가, 모르겠어요
		우리 크고 힘센 아빠가
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	reach out to me
		in a vulnerable way,
		약한 모습으로 손내미는게
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	it was --
		It was kind of touching.
		뭐랄까 뭉클했거든요
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	The red button!
		How do you not see it?!
		빨간 버튼!
		그게 안 보이냐?!
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	Before you got here, I was
		turning it on with a broom!
		너 오기 전엔
		내가 빗자루로 켰어!
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	Now just -- forget it.
		Let's get lunch.
		이제 좀- 됐고
		점심이나 먹자
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	- If I could just --
		- Come with me!
		- 이걸 일케-
		- 따라와!
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	Okay, hold the sauce in
		your mouth, swirl it around --
		좋아요, 입에 소스를 머금고
		빙그르 돌리면
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	Really coat your tongue.
		Now swallow.
		아주 혀를 감싸줘요
		이제 삼켜요
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	Mmm!
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	- Right?
		- Much better.
		- 그쵸?
		- 훨씬 낫네요
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	Okay, Jay,
		what you're gonna want to do
		좋아요, 제이,
		어떻게 드시냐면요
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	is hold the sauce
		in your mouth, sw--
		입에 소스를 머금고, 돌=
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	I know how eating works.
		먹는 방법쯤은 안다
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	- Not too shabby.
		- Thank you.
		- 근사한데
		- 감사합니다
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	You know who else makes a mean
		sauce is Gloria's dead aunt.
		글로리아네 돌아가신 큰할머니가
		진짜 죽여주는 소스를 만드셨지
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:23	- Oh.
		- Oh, there it is right there.
		아, 바로 저기 있네
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	Try some. I'm telling you,
		it's life-changing.
		먹어 보게
		정말로 인생이 바뀐다니까
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	I don't think
		we really need two sauces.
		소스가 두 개까지 필요할까요
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	And sometimes,
		when you have sauces from --
		게다가 소스가 어디에서-
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	- Now you eat. - Mm.
		- Oh, yeah, huh?
		- 먹어봐요
		- 그지? 어?
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	- Oh. Oh, my god. That is amazing.
		- Mmm.
		오, 세상에. 이거 끝내주네요
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	It's a secret recipe
		비법 레시피에요
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	that has been in my family
		for generations.
		우리 가족에 대대로 전해져오는 거죠
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	Was your sauce buried
		in a local time capsule
		타임캡슐에 들어갈 정도로요?
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	during the bicentennial?
		Because mine was.
		지역 200주년 행사에서?
		내 건 들어갔거든요
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:42	My great-aunt Miranda was
		the only one that could make it,
		큰할머니만 만드는 법을 아셨는데
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	and because I
		was the oldest girl
		내가 딸 중에서 제일 컸고
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	that didn't marry a Peruvian,
		페루인이랑 결혼하지 않아서
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	the recipe passed down to me.
		내가 비법을 받은 거에요
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	- Sauce me.
		- Right.
		- 소스 줘
		- 그래요
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Ay, I don't have many things
		that remind me of Colombia
		아아, 이 집안에서
		콜롬비아를 떠오르게 해주는 물건이
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	here in the house, but now I do.
		많지 않았는데, 이젠 있어요
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	Legend has it our sauce
		was so secret,
		전설에 따르면 우리 소스가 
		너무나 비밀스러워서
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	it was only written down
		one place.
		한 곳에만 적어두었다더라구요
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	We grew up eating this
		every Sunday,
		매주 일요일마다 이걸 먹으면서 자랐죠
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	and now Manny and Joe will, too.
		이제 매니와 조도 그러겠죠
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	It was tattooed backwards
		on a lame stable boy.
		마굿간 소년 등에 거꾸로
		적혀있었어요
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	You could only read it
		in a mirror.
		거울에 비춰야만 읽을 수 있다던가
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	Mm, can I see that recipe?
		레시피 봐도 돼요?
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	Uh, uh, well, I think it's
		a little bit rude to read --
		어, 그건 좀 무례한 것 같은데
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	- Ay!
		- You bumped my hand!
		내 손에 부딪혔어!
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	- You've ruined it!
		- No!
		빠뜨렸어!
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	No, no! I can dry it!
		I can dry it!
		아냐, 말리면 돼! 말리면!
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	No, now the ink's running.
		Cam!
		안돼, 잉크가 번지잖아 캠!
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	No, and now you have ruined
		my great-uncle's napkins!
		이젠 내 큰아버지 냅킨도 망쳤군요
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	Does -- okay, does everything
		at this table have meaning?
		이 식탁 위에 있는 건 다 의미있는 거였어요?
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:23	Hey, sorry I'm late.
		미안, 늦었어
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	My new lady, Rachel, needed help
		내 새 여친 레이첼이
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	picking a pair of shorts
		to make her stepdad mad.
		새아빠 열받을만한 반바지 
		고른다고 도와달래서
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	I wonder what's
		more of a "screw you" --
		어느게 더 엿같은 지 모르겠네
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	You telling me that story or
		that the ducks now stare at me
		네 얘기 듣는 거랑
		저 오리놈들이 슬슬 화장실 가면서
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	while they slowly
		go to the bathroom?
		나 쳐다보고 가는 거랑
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	Didn't you guys
		have three ducks?
		너네 오리 세 마리 아니었어?
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	Yeah -- one, two...
		응. 하나, 둘,
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	Oh, no.
		어, 이런
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	Uh-oh! Dude!
		저기!
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	No, no, no, no, no, no!
		안돼!
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	Where did he go?
		어디갔지?
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	Hey, look, there's
		a duck-call app we can use.
		이거 봐, 오리부르는 앱이 있어
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:48	Oh, crap. Not her.
		아, 젠장. 쟤는 안돼
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	What happened with this one?
		쟤랑 무슨 사인데?
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	Well, I was seeing her
		for a while,
		어, 잠깐 만났는데
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	then she pulled her shade down.
		바로 벽치더라구
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	Classy. Get ready.
		전형적이네. 준비해
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	 
00:10:57	 
		 
00:11:01	- Scatter!
		- Uh... Uh...
		- 흩어져!
		- 어.. 어
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	What the hell are you doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	Are you taking pictures of me
		sleeping in a bikini?
		나 비키니 입고 자는 거
		찍은 거야?
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	No! I was just trying to
		lure that little duckling
		아냐! 새끼오리 유인하려는 거야
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	back into my friend's yard.
		친구네 마당에서 도망쳤거든
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	Oh, my god!
		어머나
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	- It's so cute!
		- Thank you.
		- 너무 귀엽다!
		- 고마워
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	You're adorable
		for looking after him.
		얘 찾아다닌 거야? 귀엽게도
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	 
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:18	Hey, you know, I think I've
		seen you around school before.
		있지, 학교근처에서 너 본 것 같아
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	- I'm Tammy.
		- Manny.
		- 태미라고 해
		- 매니야
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	You have got to be kidding me.
		장난치냐 진짜
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	What drives Jay Pritchett?
		제이 프리쳇을 움직이는 건 뭐냐구요?
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:27	A desire
		never to repeat himself.
		스스로 반복하지 않으려는 마음
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	Let me do that again.
		다시
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:31	What drives Jay Pritchett?
		An Audi.
		제이 프리쳇을 움직이는 건 뭘까요?
		아우디죠
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	I'm gonna start with a joke?
		I'm following Red Murtaugh.
		농담으로 시작하자는 거야?
		레드 머터우 따라하는 꼴이군
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	The man's hilarious.
		그 사람 엄청 웃기지
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	You've seen him be that baby
		in his ads.
		자기네 광고에서 아기흉내내는 거 봤을 거다
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	Just so you know,
		the camera only has
		혹시나 싶어서 드리는 말씀인데
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	- 11 hours of battery, so...
		- Let's see what we've got.
		- 이 카메라 배터리 11시간 가거든요
		- 얼마나 남았나 보자
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	Yep.
		넵
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:44	Why do I look
		so pale and sweaty?
		나 왜 이렇게 창백하고 땀흘리게 나오지?
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	Oh, well, you're old and Irish.
		나이든 아일랜드계라서요
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:50	Hey, um -- uh, Gloria, again,
		I just want to say that I'm --
		어, 글로리아, 
		다시 한번..
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	You're sorry?
		You told me.
		미안하다구요?
		들었어요
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	Yes, and, uh -- excuse me --
		That it was an accident.
		네, 그리고, 미안해요
		그건 실수였어요
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	Was it?
		그래요?
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Yes, of course.
		당연하죠
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	I think.
		I -- I don't know.
		아마도요.
		모르겠어요
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	You have destroyed my children's
		connection to their past,
		내 아이들과 선조들과의
		연결고리를 끊어놓고서는
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	and you might have done it
		on purpose?
		일부러 그랬을지도 모르겠다구요?
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	I'm sorry. Andrew humiliated me
		today at the Farmers' Market,
		미안해요. 앤드류가 오늘 
		장터에서 날 엄청 망신준데다
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	and I've always been
		sauce-competitive...
		늘 소스경쟁심이 강해서
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	Look, just let me help you
		re-create it.
		저, 다시 만들 수 있게 도울게요
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	I saw my aunt make it once
		when I was 8 years old.
		여덟살 때 딱 한 번 
		만드시는 거 봤다구요
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	You think
		I'm going to remember --
		그걸 기억할 것 같아요?
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	 
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:22	Cilantro!
		What?
		-씰란뜨로!
		-네?
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	That car backfiring,
		it sounded like gunshots.
		저 차 폭발음, 꼭 총소리 같았어요
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	I remember when I was a little
		girl in my aunt's kitchen,
		어릴 때 숙모네 부엌에 있었는데
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	and she started chopping
		the cilantro really loud
		숙모가 씰란뜨로를 
		정말 시끄럽게 다져서
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	so that we couldn't
		hear the noise.
		그 소리를 못 들었었죠
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	Yes, okay. Well,
		what else do you remember?
		좋아요, 또 뭐가 기억나요?
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	Well, nothing, Cam.
		It was 30 years ago.
		안나요, 캠
		30년 전이었다구요
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	No, the recipe is inside you!
		It just needs to come out!
		아뇨, 레시피는 글로리아 안에 있어요!
		꺼내기만 하면 돼요!
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	Mommy, I found it.
		엄마, 찾았어요
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	- Lemon juice!
		- What?
		- 레몬 주스!
		- 네?
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	Oh, see? I told you
		it's just a matter of time!
		그렇죠? 시간 문제라고 했죠!
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Capers, jalapeno,
		케이퍼! 할라피뇨!
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	and a dash of black pepper!
		후추 약간!
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:58	It's just so sad.
		너무 슬펐어
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	The guy decides to
		spend the rest of his life
		사랑하지도 않는 좀비랑
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	with some zombie
		he doesn't love.
		평생을 보내기로 결심하다니
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:04	- Your table is ready.
		- Smashing!
		- 테이블 준비됐습니다
		[영국 악센트 ] - 끝내주네요!
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	- A bucket of chips --
		- We're not doing that.
		- 칩 한 바구니랑
		- 이러지 말자
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	Okay.
		알았어
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	Hey, um, real quick --
		헤이, 잠깐만
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Why wasn't it more uncomfortable
		for you to watch that movie?
		넌 왜 그 영화 보는 게
		안 불편한 거야?
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	Right. Because zombies
		killed my parents.
		맞아. 좀비가 내 부모님 원순데
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	Oh, never mind. I forgot
		you can't have an adult conversation.
		아, 됐어. 넌 성숙한 대화랑은
		거리가 멀었었지
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	No, okay, yes.
		아냐, 그래, 그랬어
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	If -- if we would have watched
		that movie a few months ago,
		만약- 만약 우리가 
		몇 달 전에 그 영화를 봤다면
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	it would have been
		really weird, but...
		굉장히 어색했을 거야, 하지만...
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	We're all good now, right?
		이젠 괜찮잖아, 그렇지?
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	Oh, yeah.
		No, I mean, I am good.
		아, 그럼.
		진짜루. 난 괜찮지
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	Dylan and I picked up
		right where we left off.
		딜런이랑 나 바로 다시 만났거든
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	I was just checking on you.
		네가 괜찮은가 싶어서
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	'Cause for a while there,
		you were getting a little, uh...
		왜냐면 한동안 네가 좀, 어..
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	♪ Doot-doot, do-do-do-do,
		doot-doot, do-do ♪
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	Yeah.
		그래
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	Beth stood by me.
		베쓰가 곁에 있어줬어
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	Well, you know,
		as close as she could.
		아, 물론 가능한한 말야
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	Hmm.
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	That's when I knew
		I was with the right person.
		그 때 베쓰가 내 사람인 걸 알았지
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	And --
		And don't get me wrong --
		그리고-
		오해는 하지 마
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	I was --
		I was pretty hung up on you.
		나- 너한테 마음이 있었어
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	 
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:52	But once I got it down to
		only one woman in my head,
		하지만 한 사람만 생각하고 나니까
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	I saw Beth in a whole new way,
		베쓰를 완전히 새롭게 보게 돼서
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	and we were able to
		move forward.
		앞으로 나아갈 수 있었지
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:57	That makes sense.
		그렇구나
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	I'm happy for you.
		잘 됐다
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:03	Look at us,
		brother and sister,
		이것 보게, 우리 남매가
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	separated from our mum...
		헤어져서...
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	Oh, you're so good at that.
		와 정말 잘한다
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	Hey, what do you think about
		있지, 우리 결혼식에
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	inviting Haley and Dylan
		to the wedding?
		헤일리랑 딜런 초대하는 거 어때?
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	I love that idea.
		좋은 생각이야
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	And I love you for having it.
		그렇게 생각하는 너도 좋고
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:20	Why do you think people
		stopped saying "coinkydink"?
		왜 사람들이 "우여네 일치"란 말을
		요즘 안 쓰는 거지?
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	Dylan, um...
		딜런, 저기..
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	Oh, god.
		오 갓
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	You're breaking up with me
		again, aren't you?
		너 나랑 또 헤어지려는 거지?
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	I'm sorry.
		I just -- I --
		미안해. 난 그냥..
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	I feel like Andy and Beth
		앤디랑 베쓰 그리고
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	and everyone in the world
		are moving forward,
		세상 모든 사람들이
		앞으로 나아가는 것 같은데
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	and we're moving backward.
		우리만 뒤로 가고 있어
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	Actually, we're stopping,
		아니, 멈출 거야
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	because I want to
		get out of the car.
		왜냐면 나 차에서 내릴 거거든
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	- Dylan --
		- Stop!
		- 딜런..
		- 세워!
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	I'm tired of
		being jerked around.
		이리저리 휘둘리는 것도 지쳤어
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	Now I'm moving forward, too.
		이제 나도 앞으로 갈거야
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	Can't you at least call an Uber?
		카카오택시라도 부르지 않을래?
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	You know they banned me for
		talking too much to the drivers!
		나 기사한테 말 너무 많이 건다고
		차단당한거 알잖아!
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	She's still not answering.
		I can't believe we lost them.
		아직도 안 받아
		차를 놓치다니 말도 안돼
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	We're almost home. I can track
		her phone from the computer.
		집에 다 왔어
		컴퓨터로 알렉스 폰 위치 추적하면 돼
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	"I hope
		you can track her phone
		"폰 위치 추적은 차량 추적보단
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	better than you tracked
		that van."
		좀 잘했으면 좋겠네"
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	I'm sorry, Claire.
		Just 'cause I'm 1/64th Cherokee,
		미안하지만 클레어,
		내가 1/64 인디언이라고 해서
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	it doesn't make me
		a natural tracker.
		추적자로 타고나는 건 아니거든
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	You realize I'm not
		participating in this.
		나 신경도 안 쓰고 있는 거 알지
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	Well, you made it pretty clear
		it was my fault we lost them
		차를 놓친 게 내 탓이란 건 확실히 말하더라
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	due to
		my less-than-manly driving.
		내가 운전을 남자답지 않게 해서 그렇다고
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	- Oh, my god.
		- Yes, this again.
		- 제발
		- 그래, 또 이 얘기야
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	I'm not letting it go till you
		admit that you wish I was a --
		당신이 그렇게 생각했다고
		인정하기 전까진 안 그만할거야
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	Phil, it's the van!
		필, 그 밴이야!
00:15:16	 
		 
00:15:17	- In my own house?!
		- Oh, no!
		- 내 집에?!
		- 아, 안돼
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	 
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:19	- Okay, now, hang on.
		- Don't hold me back, Claire!
		- 좋아, 기다려봐
		- 나 막지 마, 클레어!
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	I may be one 1/64th Cherokee,
		내 1/64은 인디언일지라도
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:24	but I'm also 63/64ths
		crazy white guy!
		내 63/64은 미친 백형이라고!
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	Where is he?!
		그 놈 어딨어?
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	- Are you okay?
		- What are you talking about?
		- 괜찮아?
		- 무슨 소리에요?
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	- Are you okay?
		- I-I-I'm fine.
		- 괜찮은 거야?
		- 괘, 괜찮은데요
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:32	- No, I'm sorry! I-I --
		- You are now!
		- 아니, 죄송해요, 저
		- 유감이다!
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	 
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:37	Reuben?
		루벤?
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	Oh, my god!
		I killed Reuben!
		이럴수가
		내가 루벤을 죽였어!
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:42	Oh, babe?
		자기야?
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	What's going on?
		That's blood.
		무슨 일이지?
		피다
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	In my defense, I didn't think
		anyone would ever find out.
		변호를 하자면요,
		아무도 모를 거라고 생각했어요
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Stay with me, Reuben!
		정신 차려, 루벤
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	Okay, so Reuben is the one
		좋아, 그러니까 루벤이 
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	who picked you up in the van?
		밴에다 널 태운 거야?
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	Yes, it was his dad's --
		Oh, my god!
		네, 그거 루벤 아버지 차-
		오 마이갓
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	Have you been following me?
		나 따라다닌 거에요?
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:57	He's coming to.
		He's gonna be fine.
		정신차릴거야
		괜찮을거야
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	No! No!
		앙대!
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:01	Don't try
		and make this our fault.
		우리 잘못인 척 돌리려고 하지 마라
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:03	You are the one who went to the
		liquor store and bought -- what?
		너야말로 주점에 가서 샀잖아
		여기 있구만
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	Ice.
		얼음이
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	Reuben sprained his hamstring
		today while playing Quidditch.
		루벤이 퀴디치하다가
		햄스트링 다쳤단 말이에요
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	Honey, don't take this
		the wrong way, but Reuben?
		오해는 하지 말고 들으렴
		아무리 그래도 루벤이랑?
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	- We're in love.
		- Oh, shut up.
		- 사랑하는 사이에여
		- 아, 입 다물어
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	No, no, no, keep talking!
		안돼 안돼 계속 말해
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:17	Remember what happened
		when you tripped and fell
		네가 혼자 발 잘못 디뎌서
		넘어진 거 기억나니?
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	right before we got here?
		우리가 오기 직전에
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	You know what?
		Caltech is hard.
		그치만
		칼텍은 힘들어요
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	Between all the geniuses
		and breaking up with Sanjay,
		천재들만 우글거리지
		산제이랑은 헤어졌고
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	I just wanted
		something comfortable,
		좀 편한 선택이 필요했어요
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	even if it is a wormy little
		dork that worships me.
		그게 날 숭배하는 찌질남이어두요
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Oh, honey, I understand.
		이해하고 말고
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	Oh, like mother,
		like daughter, I guess.
		부전여전이구만
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	Okay.
		He's gonna be fine.
		됐어
		루벤은 괜찮을거야
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	Phil, come over here
		and talk to me for a second.
		필, 이리와서 잠깐 얘기 좀 해
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	Oh, okay.
		아, 그래요
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	Well, I guess we're done
		with my thing already.
		내 건은 벌써 끝난 것 같네요
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	If I was ever stupid enough
		to imply, for one second,
		내가 단 일초라도
		당신이 나쁜 녀석이 아니라고
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	that you were not
		bad boy enough for me,
		생각할 만큼 멍청했더라도 말야
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	I couldn't possibly think that
		right now.
		지금은 상상도 못할 거야
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	Because
		I attacked a 16-year-old?
		내가 16살 짜리를 공격해서?
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	You didn't know
		who was in that closet.
		옷장안에 있다는 건 어떻게 알았겠어
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:51	Look, he's up.
		봐, 깨어났어
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	Okay, we're gonna
		leave the two of you alone.
		그래, 너희 둘만 있게 해줄게
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	Oh, wait, wait, wait,
		no, no, no.
		아, 잠깐 잠깐 잠깐
		아뇨 아니 안돼요
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	Yeah, we're not gonna
		tell anyone about this, right?
		우리 사이 비밀로 할 거에요, 그치?
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	Forbidden love.
		It's -- it's hotter that way.
		금지된 사랑
		더 짜릿하겠는데
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Also,
		I -- I had a-a-a wand.
		아, 저한테 마술 지팡이가 있는데요
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	Um...
		어..
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	I hate myself so much.
		내 자신이 싫어진다
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	Mmm! It's good.
		으음! 맛있어!
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	Of course it's good.
		It's -- I'm sure -- o... Kay.
		당연하죠
		그거- 그래요
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	Oh, my gosh.
		It's glorious.
		이럴수가
		눈부신 맛이에요
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	So much better than mine.
		내 거보단 훨씬 나아요
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	- Well, your sauce is --
		- Is garbage!
		- 캠 소스도-
		- 쓰레기죠
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	- Mm-hmm.
		- It's mostly ketchup.
		- 으흠
		- 케찹이랑 진배없어요
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	Gloria, this is
		what we need to be selling
		글로리아, 우리 이걸 팔아야해요
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	at the Farmers' Market.
		장터에서요
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	We would have them lined up
		clear down
		사람들이 살려고 줄을 서서
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	past the cruelty-free
		beaver-milk stand.
		학대없는 비버유 판매대까지 갈거에요
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:25	I would crush Andrew.
		앤드류를 발라버리겠죠
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	I cannot go back
		to the Farmers' Market.
		장터로 돌아갈 순 없어요
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	The year was 2011.
		2011년이었죠
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	I had just come back
		from Colombia
		막 콜롬비아에서 돌아와서
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	with a box full of our family's
		homemade hair relaxer,
		우리가문 홈메이드 
		헤어 로션 한 박스를 들고 갔죠
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	the Colombian comb-out.
		콜롬비아식 머리 피는 약이요
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	Friday, I sold 50 bottles,
		but Saturday...
		금요일에, 50통을 팔았어요
		그런데 토요일에...
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	It says on the bottle to
		leave it in for three minutes!
		3분동안 두라고 적혀있잖아요!
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	No, it says,
		"leave in for three.
		아뇨, "3번 두세요"
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	Minutes later,
		you will look fantastic."
		"몇 분 지나면, 예뻐질거에요"
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	One, two, three, comb it out.
		"하나, 둘, 셋, 쫙 펴져요"
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	Ay, I see how
		it can be confusing.
		아 좀 헷갈릴 수도 있겠네요
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:56	If it's true,
		as many people theorize
		그게 사실이라면,
		많은 사람들이 주장하듯이
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:59	that Stonehenge was,
		in fact, a druid closet --
		스톤헨지가 사실은
		드루이드의 옷장이었다고-
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	- Mitchell.
		- Hmm?
		- 밋첼
		- 릉?
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	Uh, oh. Oh, yeah.
		어, 아, 예
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	- Oh, good. We -- we got it!
		- What's with you?
		- 와, 좋아요, 됐어요!
		- 왜 그러냐?
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	I'm sorry.
		죄송해요
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	I'm sorry. I got this whole
		work thing stressing me out.
		죄송해요
		스트레스 받는 일이 너무 많아서요
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	It's your lucky day.
		너 오늘 운이 좋구나
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	You have an audience
		with a Titan of Industry
		산업의 거인이 네 이야길 들어주는데
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	without having to buy
		the $15-a-plate dinner ticket.
		접시당 15달러짜리 식사권도
		안 사해도 되고 말야.
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	What's the issue?
		뭐가 문제냐?
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	Well, I got this job offer at
		this really big firm, but, um...
		그게, 정말 큰 로펌에서 제의를 받았는데, 음..
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	I've actually,
		uh, been thinking about
		사실은,
		생각하는 게 있었어요
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	maybe starting my own practice.
		내 회사를 시작하는 건 어떨지
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	- What's your gut tell you?
		- I don't know.
		- 네 직감은 뭐라냐?
		- 모르겠어요
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	I-I would like to have my own
		firm, but that's really scary.
		내 회사를 갖고 싶긴한데
		정말 겁나는 일이란 말에요
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	But this other offer
		is very attractive,
		거기에 그 제안이 워낙 솔깃한지라
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	but I'd have to report
		to this guy who I hate,
		근데 완전 싫은 놈한테 보고해야되고
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	which, you know, might be
		worth it for the job security --
		근데, 안정성을 위해서라면
		참아야 할 부분이긴 하죠
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	- Take the offer.
		- Really?
		- 받아들여
		- 정말로요?
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	It takes a certain type
		of personality
		네 회사를 운영하려면
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	to run your own thing.
		갖춰야할 것들이 있다
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	You have to be a fighter.
		싸울 줄 알아야 해
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	Well, this is fun.
		재밌게 돌아가네요
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	You wanted my honest opinion.
		솔직한 충고가 필요하지 않냐
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	No, Cam! I said no.
		싫어요, 캠. 안돼요
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	The polar ice caps are melting,
		gridlock in Washington --
		북극의 만년설은 녹고 
		워싱턴은 차만 막히고-
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	America needs to
		feel good again, Gloria.
		미국에도 좀 좋은 일이 있어야 해요, 글로리아
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	- Let them taste your sauce.
		- What's happening now?
		- 소스를 맛보게 해주라구요
		- 이번엔 또 뭐야?
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	He wants me to sell my sauce
		at the Farmers' Market,
		장터에 내 소스를 팔라고 하잖아요
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	but I am not interested.
		난 흥미 없다구요
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	- I agree with Gloria.
		- Thank you so much.
		- 글로리아 말이 맞아
		- 고마워요
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	Yeah, you crashed and burned
		with the hair thing.
		그 머리약 완전히 망했잖아
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	You need more
		of that humiliation?
		무슨 창피를 더 당하려고?
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	We don't know that
		that would happen.
		또 망하리란 법은 없지 않아요?
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:09	Disappearing middle-class,
		racial unrest...
		중산층이 몰락하고,
		인종 차별 논란에..
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	You got a nice thing going here,
		Gloria. Enjoy it.
		이 정도로도 충분하잖아
		글로리아, 그냥 즐겨
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	What? You don't think
		that I can do it?
		뭐라구요? 
		내가 못할 것 같아요?
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	No. No, he doesn't.
		아니, 아니죠
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	He thinks that he's the only
		business titan in this family.
		아빠는 우리 가족 중에 자기만
		사업의 거인이라고 생각하는 거죠
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	Nobody can tell me
		what I can or cannot do.
		누구도 나한테 
		할 수 있다 없다 말할 순 없죠
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	I have some sauce to sell.
		이만 소스를 팔러가야 해서
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	And I'm gonna go
		register my new firm right now.
		전 제 로펌 등록하러 가야해서요
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	And I'm gonna storm out, too,
		나도 뛰쳐나갈거에요
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	even though both of those things
		actually make me very happy.
		앞에 두 개가 전부 
		맘에 쏙 드는 일이긴 하지만
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:43	You want to know
		what drove Jay Pritchett?
		제이 프리쳇의 원동력을 알고 싶다구요?
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	People telling me
		I wasn't good enough.
		사람들은 내가 못할 거라고 말했죠
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	There's something about
		a person telling you
		누군가 넌 못한다고 말하면
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	you can't do something.
		뭔가 움직이게 되죠
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:52	Blood.
		피다
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	It just lights
		the competitive fires...
		경쟁심에 불을 붙이고
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:59	...drives us to take risks...
		위험을 감수하게 하고
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:04	...opens us up
		to new opportunities...
		새로운 기회를 맞이하게 되죠
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	Oh, hey, Sarah.
		아, 안녕, 새라
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	I'm sorry about your cat.
		고양이 일은 안됐어
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	I heard you got arrested.
		너 체포됐었다면서
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:11	Everything I did, I did
		to prove the naysayers wrong.
		그들이 틀렸다는 걸 
		증명하려고 이 모든 걸 이룬거죠
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	So, to everyone who didn't think
		I was good enough --
		그러니, 난 안될거라고 생각했던 모든 이에게-
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	Look, dad!
		I tied my shoes!
		아빠, 봐요!
		신발 묶었어요!
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	Good job, Joe!
		잘했다, 조!
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	Ah.
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	...how do
		you like me now?
		이제 어때?
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:26	Honey, I don't wanna go
		to this Titans dinner
		자기야, 나도 진짜 가기 싫은데
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	any more than you do,
		but we're gonna be late.
		우리 이러다 거인 시상식에 늦을거야
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:30	Phil.
		필
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	Phil. Phil!
		필, 필!
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	Dunphy.
		던피
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:35	What is going on?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	I'm trying to
		pay Luke's impound fee,
		루크 벌금 내려고 하는데
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	but this automated phone system
		자동 전화 시스템이
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	doesn't understand
		anything I'm saying.
		내 말을 하나도 못 인식하네
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	Dun-phy.
		던-피
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:43	Dun-phy.
		Yes.
		던-피
		그래
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	No. No. 
		Not Bill Dunphy.
		아니, 아냐
		빌 던피가 아니라고
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	We went over my first name
		for 20 minutes!
		이름 부분만 20분은 했는데!
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:50	Phil!
		필!
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:53	Phil!

00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:55	Phil!
