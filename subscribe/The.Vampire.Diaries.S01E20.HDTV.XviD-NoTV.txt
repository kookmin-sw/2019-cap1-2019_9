00:00:01	Previously on
		"the Vampire Diaries"...
		지난 이야기
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	For over a century,
		I have lived in secret.
		한 세기를 걸쳐
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	Until now. I know the risk.
		위험한건 알지만
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	But I have to know her
		그녀를 알아야만 한다
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	Elena... she's a dead
		ringer for Katherine.
		엘레나 말이지
		캐더린과 똑닮았더군
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	I want you all to myself.
		나하고만 있어주면 좋겠어
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	Just as he wants me, but I'm the one.
		그도 날 원해요
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	Who gets to make all the rules.
		선택은 내가 하죠
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	Go get the sheriff. We have a vampire.
		보안관을 데려와
		뱀파이어가 있네
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:16	No. Don't take her!
		캐더린은 데려가지 마요!
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	You'll be killed along with them.
		너도 같이 죽게 될거야
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	Then let me be killed.
		그럼 죽게 내버려둬
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	Damn it. We'll get her back.
		다시 구해낼거야
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Don't you think that you've done enough?
		할 방법은 다 했잖아
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	Stefan's still
		drinking human blood.
		스테판은 아직도
		인간피를 마시고 있어
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:25	Aah! Stefan!
		스테판
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	Stefan.
		스테판
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Blood brings out what's inside of me.
		피는 내 본모습을
		끌어내는것 뿐야
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	I'm not gonna give up on you, Stefan.
		널 포기하지 않을거야
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	I believe in you. Stop! Stop!
		- 널 믿어
		- 그만해!
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:34	Stop! I'm so sorry.
		멈추라구!
		미안해
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	It's OK. You're gonna be OK.
		괜찮아
		괜찮아질거야
00:00:39	 
		 
00:01:07	Uhh.
		 
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:16	We have to get to the
		church. They're waiting.
		교회로 가야해
		그들이 기다리고 있어
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	Circle around that
		way. I'll distract them.
		저 길로 돌아서 가
		내가 주위를 돌릴게
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:21	Go.
		어서
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:25	Over here!
		여기요!
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:27	There's another one! Quick!
		한 마리 더 있습니다!
		빨리요!
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	Help me!
		도와주세요
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	Arm yourselves.
		준비하게
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:40	Uhh!
		 
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:46	We don't have long.
		시간이 촉박해
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:49	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:01:52	 
		 
00:02:02	We're gonna get you out of here.
		여기서 꺼내줄게
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:06	Damon, hurry. Hurry.
		데이먼, 서둘러
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:11	Aah!
		 
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	No!
		안돼!
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	No.
		안돼
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:22	Damon. Oh...
		데이먼
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:27	Come on. Let's go.
		어서 가봅시다
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:34	Uhh!
		 
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:50	Stefan.
		스테판
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:55	Stefan.
		스테판
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:59	I love you, Stefan.
		사랑해, 스테판

		The Vampire Diaries 1x20
		Blood Brothers
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:51	It's so hard to see
		him locked up like this.
		이렇게 갇힌 모습을
		보고 있기 힘들어요
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	You're the one who locked him up.
		갇아둔 사람은 바로 너면서
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:56	You helped.
		그쪽이 도와줬잖아요
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	I couldn't have him running
		around chewing on people.
		마을을 방황하며
		사람들 물게 둘 순 없어
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	While the town was looking
		for vampires, now, could I?
		마을 사람들이 뱀파이어를
		찾는 중인데. 그렇지 않니?
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	It had nothing to do with
		you actually caring about him.
		그를 진실로 걱정해서
		그러는게 아니잖아요
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:04	Your thing, not mine.
		너 같은 성격이 아니라
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:52	Katherine had me make
		that for you weeks ago.
		몇주 전에 캐더린이 그걸
		만들어달라고 했었죠
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	- Where am I? 
		- The quarry just north of town.
		- 여기가 어디야?
		- 마을 남쪽의 채석장요
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:59	My brother and I brought
		you here last night.
		어젯밤 남동생하고 제가
		여기로 데려왔어요
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	We found you dead in the woods.
		숲속에 죽어 있는걸 발견했죠
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Where's Damon?
		데이먼은 어디있지?
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:16	Am I... am I a... not yet.
		- 나 혹시
		- 아직은 아니에요
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	You're in transition.
		변이되는 과정에 있죠
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	But how? I...
		그치만 어떻게?
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	You had Katherine's blood
		in your system when you died.
		죽어갈 때 캐더린의 피가
		몸 속에 있었죠
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	No. I never...
		아니, 난 절대..
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	She's been compelling you to
		drink it for weeks, Stefan.
		지난 몇 주간 마시라고
		최면을 걸었던 거에요, 스테판
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:31	And Damon?
		데이먼은?
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:32	No compulsion was necessary.
		주문이 필요 없었죠
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	He drank from her willingly.
		자진해서
		캐더린의 피를 먹었죠
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:59	I woke up last night. I
		didn't know where I was.
		어젯밤에 일어났어
		어디 있었는지 몰랐지
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:03	I went to the church.
		교회에 갔어
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:05	And I watched them drag her inside.
		안으로 끌고 가는걸 목격했지
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:09	Then they set fire to it.
		그리곤 불을 질렀어
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	And the whole church went up into flames.
		교회가 화염속에 사라졌지
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:18	They killed her, Stefan.
		그들이 죽였어, 스테판
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:23	She's gone.
		캐더린은 세상을 떠났다구
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:30	Did you ever
		figure out what that is?
		그게 뭔지 알아내긴 했나요?
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.
		아니. 이게 뭐든간에
		작동을 안하네
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	Pearl didn't say anything else about it?
		펄은 아무말 안했어요?
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	She thought she was
		stealing his vampire compass,
		뱀파이어 나침반을
		훔친줄 알았는데
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	but it was a pocket watch.
		주머니 시계였다는군
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	That Johnathan Gilbert
		was a crazy scientist.
		조나단 길버트는
		정신 나간 과학자였고
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:47	Have you spoken to your uncle lately?
		삼촌하고 요즘
		얘기 해봤니?
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	I've been avoiding him, actually.
		사실은 피하고 있어요
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	That, and I've been here most nights.
		게다가 저녁은 거의
		이곳에서 보내니까
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	So, you'll be here again tonight?
		오늘밤에도 올꺼니?
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	Is that a problem?
		문제가 되나요?
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	Yes.
		응
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	You're a complete nuisance.
		정말 귀찮거든
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	Heh. See you later.
		나중에 봐요
00:07:03

00:07:13	Hey. Surprise.
		놀랐지
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	What are you doing here?
		여긴 무슨 일이야?
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	Picking up this.
		이거 가질러
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:20	A class schedule?
		수업시간표?
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	Starting tomorrow, I'm
		officially a student here.
		내일부터 난 공식적으로
		이곳 학생이 돼
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	You're kidding me, right?
		농담하는거지?
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	No. I finally beat my mom down. Heh.
		아니. 마침내
		엄마가 항복하셨지
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	But why would you want to go 
		to high school?
		뭣하러 학교를 다니게?
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	It blows.
		정말 재미없는데
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	Do I really need to answer that?
		정말 대답이 필요해?
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:40	You'd suffer through all
		this just to hang out with me?
		나랑 함께 있기 위해서
		고생을 하겠단 거야?
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	Yeah.
		응
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	I would.
		그럴거야
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:47	That's, um...
		그건..
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:49	Stupid? Pathetic?
		바보같아? 딱해?
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:51	Old lurky me?
		원래처럼 끈질기다고?
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	It's awesome.
		정말 잘됐다구
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:57	It's awesome.
		너무 좋아
00:07:59	 
		 
00:08:07	Brought you something to eat...
		먹을 거 가져왔어
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	100% Stefan diet approved.
		스테판의 공인된
		식이요법대로
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	You know what will
		happen if you don't eat.
		밥 안 먹으면
		어떻게 되는지 알지
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	You'll get all rotting and crusty.
		쇠약해지고 심술궂어지지
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	I'm not hungry.
		배 안고파
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	Of course you are.
		무슨 소리
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	We're eternally hungry. Take it.
		우린 끊임없이
		배가 고픈걸. 받아
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:25	The human blood should be gone by now.
		지금쯤 인간 피는
		다 소화됐을거야
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	You want to explain why
		you're still in here.
		아직까지 여기서
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	Feeling sorry for yourself?
		자책하는 이유를
		설명해줄래?
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:32	Come on. Drink up.
		어서. 마셔
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:43	Fine. Starve.
		좋아. 굶어라
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	What do I care?
		내가 왜 신경쓰겠어?
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:50	Hello?
		여보세요
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	Hey, it's Alaric Saltzman.
		알라릭 살츠만입니다
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Before I hang up, how
		did you get this number?
		내가 끊기 전에
		어떻게 이 번호를 알아냈지?
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	Ah, it's a mystery. 
		Listen, I've, uh,
		미스터리야
		들어봐
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	been doing some digging on Elena's uncle.
		엘레나 삼촌에 관해
		조사를 해봤어
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	You interested? What kind of digging?
		- 관심있나?
		- 어떤 조사?
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	I've got an old friend from Duke.
		듀크대 동창
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	Who studied criminology
		when we were there together.
		대학교에서
		범죄학을 공부했던 친구지
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	Let's just say he's become
		a very proficient digger.
		정보수집에 능하지
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:08	Well, did he find anything, by chance?
		뭐 찾아낸게 있나?
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	Well, I had him run a track
		on John's cell records.
		존의 휴대폰 기록을
		추적했다네
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	He was getting a call from a number...
		한 전화번호로
		계속 전화가 왔었어
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	The same number that
		Elena dialed to get Isobel.
		엘레나가 이자벨과 통화하려고
		걸었던 번호와 똑같지
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	And then the number was disconnected.
		그후론 그 번호와
		연락이 끊겼어
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	- Isobel knows John. 
		- Whatever. We knew that.
		이자벨이 존을 안다
		다 아는 사실이잖아
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	Right. Well, after that, he started
		getting calls from a new number.
		그 후로, 새로운 번호로
		전화를 받기 시작했어
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:23	And I had my friend run a geotrack.
		그 친구가 위치추적을 했지
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	Got the address. It's...
		주소를 알아냈어
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:27	It's an apartment in Grove Hill.
		그로브 힐에 있는 아파트야
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	Isobel's in Grove Hill?
		이자벨이
		그로브 힐에 살아?
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	I don't know. I thought we could
		take a look and see what we find.
		모르겠어. 가서
		뭘 찾을수 있나 보자구
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	Perfect. Give me the address.
		좋아. 주소 불러줘
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	Oh, so you can go without
		me? No. I don't think so.
		나 빼놓고 가시게?
		그건 안돼지
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:38	I'm not going with you.
		You tried to kill me.
		같이 안갈거야
		날 죽이려고 했잖아
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	Yeah, well, you did kill me.
		그쪽이 날 죽였던거지
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:42	Hold on. What?
		잠깐. 뭐야?
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	I'm just grabbing some clothes,
		and then I'll be right over.
		옷 좀 챙기고
		바로 갈게요
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	- How's Stefan? 
		- Extra broody.
		- 스테판은 어때요?
		- 심하게 암울해졌지
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	Hold on.
		잠깐만
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	You drive. Pick me up in an hour.
		당신이 운전해
		1시간 후에 데릴러와
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	Done.
		알았어
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:56	He won't eat anything.
		아무것도 안 먹겠대
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	He has to ea what's his favorite...
		먹어야 해요
		그가 좋아하는
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	Kind of, um...
		종류는..
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	His favorite kind of what?
		무슨 종류?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	Type of animal blood that he prefers?
		그가 좋아하는
		동물피 말예요?
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	Ew. Gross.
		징그러워라
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	Heh. Your joking doesn't help.
		농담은 도움이 하나도 안되요
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	Helps me. Now, hurry up.
		나한텐 도움되는걸
		서둘러
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	I can't baby-sit all
		night. I have things to do.
		밤새 널 돌볼 순 없어
		할일이 있거든
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	I would say, "drop dead," but...
		정말 놀라운걸요
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	Ha ha.
		 
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	Stefan likes...
		스테판은
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	Puppy blood...
		애완견 피를 좋아해
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	Little golden retriever
		puppies with cute, fluffy ears.
		귀엽고 솜털같은
		귀를 가진 리트리버견들
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	That's his favorite.
		스테판이 제일 좋아하지
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:33	Sorry.
		미안
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:35	Uncle John.
		존 삼촌
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	I didn't see you there.
		계신거 못 봤네요
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	I thought we could talk. We
		haven't had a chance to catch up.
		얘기 좀 하고 싶었다
		그동안 못했던 얘기도 하고
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:43	I'm actually just heading out, so...
		사실 나가는 중이라
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	Well, it won't take long.
		금방 끝낼거야
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	What did you want to talk about?
		무슨 얘기하고 싶으신데요?
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	Well...
		글쎄..
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	I know you know.
		네가 아는거 안다
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	Know what?
		뭘요?
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	It's really silly to keep pretending.
		모르는 척 하는거 우습다
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	What do you think your mother would say.
		네 엄마가 뭐라고 하실까
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	If she knew you were dating a vampire?
		네가 뱀파이어와
		사귄단걸 알면?
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:06	Which mother?
		어떤 엄마 말씀이죠?
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:23	I bet Johnathan Gilbert
		has told father by now.
		지금쯤 조나단 길버트가
		아버지한테 말했을거야
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:27	Wonder how he took the
		news that we're dead.
		우리가 죽었단 소식을
		어떻게 받아들이실까
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:30	As if he cares. He betrayed us.
		신경이나 쓰실까
		아버지는 우릴 속였어
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	He thought he was protecting us, Damon.
		우리를 지켜주시는 걸로
		생각했던 거야
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	He thought he was protecting this town.
		이 마을을 지키는 일이라고
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	God.
		세상에
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	This sun hurts my eyes.
		햇살 때문에
		눈이 너무 아프다
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	It's part of it.
		뱀파이어의 약점이지
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	The muscle aches, the sick feeling...
		근육이 아프고
		메스꺼운 느낌
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	Emily says it's our
		bods pushing us to feed,
		에밀리가 그러길
		우리 몸이 피를 갈구한대
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	to complete the transition.
		변이가 완성되기 위해서는
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	That's not gonna happen.
		그럴 일 없을거야
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	Is that your choice, then?
		형이 선택한게 그거야?
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	To die instead?
		차라리 죽으려고?
00:11:56	 
		 
00:11:56	Isn't it yours?
		넌 아니니?
00:11:58	 
		 
00:12:00	This was all to be with Katherine.
		다 캐더린을 위한 거였잖아
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	But she's gone.
		이제 세상을 떠났으니
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	I want it over.
		그냥 이 세상을
		끝내고 싶어
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:08	How you feelin'?
		기분이 좀 어때?
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	Damon says you need to drink that.
		데이먼이 그러길
		그걸 마셔야 한대
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:16	You need it, Stefan.
		너한테 필요해, 스테판
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	Can't survive without it.
		피 없이는 살 수 없어
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	- I don't want to survive. 
		- What?
		- 살고 싶지 않아
		- 뭐라고?
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:23	- No, don't say that. 
		- I'm sorry, Elena.
		- 그런 말 마
		- 미안해
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	No more.
		더 이상은 안돼
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	After what I've done, it has to end.
		내가 저질렀던 일들 때문에
		끝내야만 해
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	I just want it over.
		난 그저 끝나길 바란다구
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:39	He's just being dramatic.
		오버하는 거야
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	He's not gonna starve himself.
		굶지는 않을거야
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	Why would he say that?
		왜 그런 말씀을 하시죠?
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	He feels bad about hurting that girl.
		그 여자애를 해한걸 가지고
		자책하는 거야
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	It's a very typical step of martyr stuff.
		스테판다운 행동이지
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	- It will pass. 
		- Will it?
		- 넘어갈거야
		- 그럴까요?
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	Because he seemed to be in lot of pain.
		정말 많이 고통스러운것 같거든요
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Yeah. Well, that will
		pass, too, once he eats.
		먹기 시작한다면
		그것도 끝날거구
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	I didn't mean physical pain.
		육체적 고통을 말한거 아녜요
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	I know what you meant.
		나도 알아
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:59	Look, are you gonna be OK here if run out?
		내가 여기 없어도 괜찮겠니?
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:01	I have to go to an
		errand with the teacher.
		선생하고 볼 일이 있어서
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	The teacher?
		선생요?
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	Alaric? Are you two friends now?
		알라릭요?
		두 분 이제 친구신가요?
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	I don't have any friends, Elena.
		나한테 친구란 없어, 엘레나
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:10	Right.
		그렇죠
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	You should, um,
		넌
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	you should stay up here. You
		shouldn't be down there by yourself.
		여기서만 있거라
		지하실에 혼자 내려가지 말고
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	I'll be fine.
		괜찮을거에요
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	You know...
		있지
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	You're very trusting of
		him, given the circumstances.
		넌 이런 상황에도
		그를 아주 믿는구나
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	So are you.
		당신도 믿고 있잖아요
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving.
		안 믿었다면
		지금 나가질 않겠죠
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:31	I won't be long.
		곧 돌아오마
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:44	Hello, Mr. Gilbert.
		안녕하세요 길버트씨
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	Pearl. What a pleasure.
		펄. 정말 반갑군요
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	I must admit, I'm surprised that you came.
		솔직히 와주셔서 놀랐습니다
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	Jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss
		the sale of the building in person.
		제나가 그러길 건물매각을
		직접 논의하고 싶으시다구요
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	Still, revealing yourself to me
		like this, it took quite a risk.
		이런 식으로 나타나는거
		꽤나 용기가 필요했을텐데요
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:57	I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert.
		난 바보가 아냐
		길버트씨
00:13:59	 
		 
00:14:00	You knew who I was when
		you requested the meeting.
		만남을 요청했을때
		내 정체를 알고 있었지
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:04	So, Damon tells me that
		you're looking for the device
		데이먼이 그러길
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	I took from Johnathan.
		조나단에게서 훔친
		물건을 원한다구
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	I'm sure you realize I have no
		intention of giving it to you.
		그걸 줄 의도는
		전혀 없는것도 알겠군
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	That's why I wanted to meet you.
		그래서 만나자고 한거에요
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:13	I'm planning on changing your mind.
		마음을 바꿀 생각이죠
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	Really? How so?
		정말? 어째서?
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	With my Gilbert charm.
		우리 길버트가만의 매력을 이용해
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	I know that you have a weakness for it.
		당신 약점인거 알거든요
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:24	May I buy you a drink?
		한 잔 사줄까요?
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:29	So, your mother was
		in love with Johnathan Gilbert,
		너희 엄마가
		조나단 길버트를 사랑했는데
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	and he betrayed her? Yup.
		그녀를 배신했다고? / 응
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	And now my uncle John.
		이젠 삼촌이
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	Wants this invention-device thing.
		그 발명품을 원하는데
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	That she gave to Damon.
		데이먼한테 줬다구
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	That's pretty much it.
		그렇다고 할 수 있지
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	John mentioned there were
		more Gilbert journals.
		존이 그러길 길버트씨
		일기장이 더 있다는데
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	I bet that's how he knows everything.
		일기장으로 모든걸
		알아냈을거야
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	Do we have to talk about ts all night?
		밤새 얘기만 해야겠어?
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	I've told you everything.
		다 말해줬잖아
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	I probably shouldn't have,
		말하지 말았어야 했지
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	'cause that could get us
		both in a lot of trouble.
		우리 둘 다 곤경에 처할 수 있으니
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:57	I'm not gonna say anything.
		아무 말 안할게
00:14:59	 
		 
00:15:01	Your uncle John wants us dead.
		네 삼촌 존은
		우리가 죽길 바래
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:02	Oh, you don't know that.
		모르는 소리야
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	Yes, I do.
		잘 알아
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:07	He's a hater, Jeremy.
		뱀파이어를 증오해
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:09	Well, I'm not.
		난 아냐
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	No.
		아니지
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	You're something else entirely.
		넌 정말 뭔가 특별해
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	Oh, yeah? What would that be?
		그래? 어떤데?
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:18	My weakness.
		내 약점이지
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:49	I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.
		제나 이모한테 들키고 싶지 않아
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	Jenna's in the kitchen.
		이모는 부엌에 있어
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	She just opened the refrigerator.
		방금 냉장고를 여셨어
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	Wait. You can hear that?
		잠깐. 그게 들려?
00:15:59	 
		 
00:15:59	That is so cool.
		정말 멋지다
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:05	This is the one here.
		바로 여기야
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	The records show is was
		paid 3 months in advance.
		기록에 의하면
		세달분을 미리 냈대
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	This is where it gets tricky.
		여기서 골치 아파지지
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	I may or may not be able to get in.
		난 들어갈 수 없을지도 몰라
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	Yeah, how does that work? You
		always have to be invited in?
		어떻게 되는거야?
		늘 초대를 받아야 해?
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	By the owner or the person of entitlement.
		건물의 주인한테 말이지
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	Short-term rentals and hotels
		are a bit of a gray area.
		단기 임대나 호스텔은
		약간 애매해
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	You kind of gotta play it by ear.
		때에 따라
		처리해야 하지
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	Heh.
		 
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	Could we not kill anyone tonight, please?
		제발 오늘은 아무도
		죽이지 말아줄래?
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	You mean, you just brought
		me along for my company?
		그냥 동행하려고
		데려온거야?
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:35	It doesn't look like anyone's home.
		아무도 없는것 같은데
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:40	Yeah. I'm good.
		잘됐네
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:44	No permanent resident, apparently.
		주인이 없나보군
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:54	Uh, Rick, we have company.
		릭, 일행이 있었네
00:16:56	 
		 
00:17:08	Boys, boys, that's enough.
		그정도면 됐어요
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	I know you.
		널 알아
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:13	Damon?
		데이먼?
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	Your name is Henry. You were in the tomb.
		헨리지
		무덤 안에 있었잖아
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	Yes, sir.
		네, 맞습니다
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	What are you doing here?
		여긴 무슨 일이시죠?
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:38	May I offer
		you a drink, Mr. Gilbert?
		한 잔 드릴까요?
		길버트군?
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.
		감사합니다
		살바토어씨
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	This won't take much longer.
		오래 걸리진 않을겁니다
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:46	I want to make sure the
		founder's archives are accurate.
		설립자 의회의 문서가
		정확한지 확인하고 싶습니다
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	Be sure you document the loss
		of civilian life in the church.
		교회에서 희생된
		일반인들도 기록해두게
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	They were hardly civilians, . Salvatore.
		일반인은 거의 없었습니다
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	As far as anyone needs to know, they were.
		다른 사람들에게는
		그렇게 알려야 하지
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	As the record keeper for the council,
		의회 기록 보관자로서
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	what you write will be passed
		down through generations.
		자네가 기록하는 것들은
		다음 세대로 전해질거야
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	Certain details should be
		kept only between you and me.
		특정한 사항들은 우리만의
		비밀로 지켜져야 하지
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	For example?
		예를 들면?
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	My sons.
		우리 아들들
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	They will be remembered the innocent
		victims of the battle of willow creek,
		윌로우 크릭 전쟁의
		억울한 희생자로 기억되야 하지
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	not for their shame.
		그들의 치욕 때문이 아니라
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	Certainly, Mr. Salvatore.
		잘 알겠습니다
		살바토어씨
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:21	You know, Damon hasn't
		fed me vervain in a while.
		데이먼은 나한테
		마편초를 안 준지 꽤 됐어
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	I could be at those bars
		in flash, and you'd be dead.
		한순간에 술집에 가있을 수도
		널 죽일 수도 있어
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	Yeah, you could.
		그렇겠지
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	But you won't.
		하지만 그러진 않을거잖아
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	Please just go away.
		제발 나가줘
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	I don't want you here.
		네가 여기 있는걸
		원치 않아
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:44	What are you doing?
		뭐 하는거야?
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:46	- Get out of here. 
		- No.
		- 당장 나가
		- 싫어
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	You're taking a stupid
		risk. I could hurt you.
		바보같은 위험을 무릅쓰는거야
		널 해할 수도 있다구
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	Then I'm stupid.
		그럼 바보라고 해
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	You need to drink this.
		이거 마셔야 해
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	Elena, get out of here,
		or you'll regret it.
		엘레나, 당장 나가
		아님 후회할 거야
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	Drink.
		마셔
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	I said get out!
		나가랬잖아!
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:04	No.
		싫어
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:27	So, how do you know John Gilbert?
		어떻게 존 길버트씨를 알죠?
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	Well, I've known him for years.
		몇 년 됐어
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	He's a good friend. How do you know him?
		좋은 친구지
		자넨 뭘 아는데?
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	I met him right after
		I got out of the tomb.
		무덤을 나오고 나서
		바로 만났어요
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	He's been helping me
		out. Helping you out how?
		- 도와주고 계시죠
		- 어떻게?
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:40	Adapting. It's a whole new world...
		새로운 세계에
		적응하는데요
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	Cars, computers, match.com.
		자동차, 컴퓨터
		연애사이트 (match.com)
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	There's so much to learn.
		He helped me get this place.
		배울게 너무 많죠
		이 집에 살게 도와줬죠
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:50	So, do you live here alone,
		여기 혼자 사나?
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	or is there someone else here?
		아님 다른 사람이 있어?
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	That's my friend's very...
		Passive-aggressive way of asking,
		내 친구가 수동공격적으로
		질문을 한건데
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?
		이자벨이란 여자 아니?
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel.
		아뇨
		이자벨은 몰라요
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	I know John. He's my only real friend.
		존은 알죠
		유일하게 진정한 친구니깐요
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	He really showed me the
		ropes... how to use a microwave,
		많은 걸 알려줬어요
		전자레인지 쓰는 방법과
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	separate my whites.
		하얀 옷은 분리해두는거
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:11	What else do you do for him?
		그 대신 또 뭘 해주지?
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	I help keep an eye on things...
		You know, with the others.
		감시를 해주죠
		다른 이들 때문에
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	The others? From the tomb.
		- 다른 이들?
		- 묘지에서 나온자들요
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	They're still pissed at
		the founding families.
		설립자 가족들에
		아직도 열받아 있죠
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	For trying to burn them alive.
		산채로 화형했다고 말예요
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:21	I'm cool, but those tomb
		boys, they want revenge.
		난 괜찮지만, 무덤에 있던
		남자들은 복수를 원해요
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	What does John want with them?
		존은 뭘 하고 싶은건대?
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	He's just keeping an
		eye on them, you know?
		그냥 주시하는 것 뿐예요
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	Trying to make sure
		they stay out of trouble.
		문제 일으키지 않나
		확인하려구요
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	Well, that's John. Heh.
		He's such a do-gooder.
		존은 참 박애주의자라니까
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:33	Heh. That's John now.
		바로 존한테 왔네요
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	Oh. Hey, let me talk to him.
		내가 받아볼게
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	All right. Yeah.
		알았어요
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:44	Are you gonna answer that?
		전화 안 받을건가요?
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	Am I gonna... answer that?
		내가.. 받아야 하나?
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:53	What's going on?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:58	Uhh! Uhh!
		 
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	Aah!
		 
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:07	"Let's not
		not kill anyone tonight."
		'오늘 밤에는 아무도 죽이지 마'
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	Your words. Just pointing that out.
		당신이 그랬지
		지적하는 것 뿐야
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:15	My apologies.
		사과할게요
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:17	No apologies necessary.
		사과할 필요 없네
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:19	So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why
		should I let you have the device?
		길버트군, 왜 내가
		발명품을 줘야 하는거지?
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	Because I can help you.
		I'm connected around here.
		내가 도와줄 수 있거든요
		이 마을에 연줄이 좀 있어서
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	The town council's eating out of
		my land. They do whatever I say.
		이 마을 의회는
		내 말을 열심히 따르죠
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	And I know that you just
		want to live your life.
		그냥 여기서 계속
		살고 싶으신거 알아요
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	Complete with a white picket
		fence, and I can help you do that.
		하얀 담장을 갖고 싶다면
		그것도 도와드리구요
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	But the device doesn't work.
		Why would you even want it?
		그 물건은 작동이 안되는데
		왜 원하는 거지?
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	It's a family heirloom.
		Call me sentimental.
		조상의 가보니까요
		감상적이라고 쳐요
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:38	Johnathan was ahead of his time.
		조나단은 시대를 앞섰지
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	I read his journals.
		They're very extensive.
		일기장을 읽었어요
		아주 해박하더군요
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	He actually wrote about you.
		당신에 대해 썼죠
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	You were his one regret.
		그가 후회하는 한가지가
		바로 당신이였어요
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:47	He loved you, and he hated
		himself for what he did to you.
		사랑했고, 당신에게
		저지른 일 때문에 스스로 증오했죠
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:52	- You're lying. 
		- No.
		- 거짓말
		- 아뇨
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	On his last days, he
		wrote how sorry he was.
		살아계신 마지막 날
		그는 자책을 했어요
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:59	You were the only woman he ever loved.
		사랑했던 유일한
		여성이 당신이라면서
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:07	Good God.
		이런
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	You vampires... you're so emotional.
		당신 뱀파이어들은
		참 감정적이야
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	Johnathan Gilbert hated you.
		조나단 길버트는
		당신을 증오했어
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	His only regret was that he didn't
		drive a stake through your heart himself.
		그의 유일한 후회는 직접
		당신 심장을 찌르지 않았단 거야
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:23	- I gave it to Damon. 
		- What?
		- 데이먼한테 줬네
		- 뭐라고?
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:25	I gave your device to Damon.
		데이먼한테 발명품을 줬다구
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	Why don't you ask him for it yourself?
		직접 물어보지 그래?
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:29	I'm sure he'd be delighted to give
		it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert,
		정말 기꺼이 줄텐데
		그리고 나선, 길버트군
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	may you rot in hell.
		지옥에 떨어져 썩길 바라네
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:38	Talk to me, Stefan.
		얘기 좀 해봐
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:40	Why are you doing this?
		왜 이러는거야?
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	I'm making the decision I
		should have made years ago.
		내가 오래 전에 했어야 하는
		선택을 하는 중이야
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	What are you talking about?
		무슨 말이야?
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:50	You have to feed in order
		to complete the transition.
		변이를 완성하기 위해선
		피를 먹어야 해
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	I know that.
		알아
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:56	It was a choice I shouldn't have made.
		그 선택은 하지 말았어야 했어
00:22:59	 
		 
00:23:08	Dear God.
		세상에
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:10	Even in our death, you only feel shame?
		우리가 죽었는데도
		수치심만을 느끼시나요?
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	- You're one of them now. 
		- No.
		- 너도 그들의 하나야
		- 아뇨
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	Father, I came to say good-bye.
		아버지, 작별하러 왔어요
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	I watched you die.
		네가 죽는걸 봤어
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	You were there when we were shot?
		제가 총에 맞을 때
		거기 계셨나요?
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:22	I pulled the trigger myself.
		내가 직접 방아쇠를 당겼지
00:23:23	 
		 
00:23:24	You killed your own sons?
		자신의 아들들을 죽이신건가요?
00:23:26	 
		 
00:23:26	You were both dead to me the
		moment you sided with the vampires.
		뱀파이어의 편이 된 순간부터
		네 둘은 나한테 죽은거나 다름없었어
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	I only thank God that your mother isn't
		alive to see the disgrace you've become.
		너희 둘이 망신거리가 된 모습을
		네 어머니가 살아 보지 않아 다행이지
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	I haven't turned yet. I don't want to.
		아직 뱀파이어가 되지 않았어요
		그럴 마음도 없구요
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	I'm going to let myself
		die, father. Please.
		그냥 죽어갈 생각이에요
		아버지, 제발
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:36	Yes, you are.
		그래, 죽어야 하지
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:43	Uhh!
		 
00:23:45	 
		 
00:23:45	Father, I didn't mean to.
		아버지, 그럴 뜻은 없었는데
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	- Get away from me. 
		- No, let me help you. Please.
		- 가까이 오지 마라
		- 제가 도와드릴게요
00:23:50	 
		 
00:24:14	Ohh.
		 
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:25	Ohh.
		 
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:28	Uhh. Uhh!
		 
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	Oh, God. What's happening to me?
		나한테 무슨 일이
		일어나는 거지?
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:38	How can you even look at me right now?
		그런데도 어떻게 날
		쳐다볼 수 있어?
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	You need to be able talk
		about these things, Stefan.
		난 그런 일들을
		얘기해야만 해
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	I need to hear them.
		나도 들어야만 하구
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	Come upstairs.
		윗층으로 가자
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	We can talk about it more,
		더 얘기하자
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:51	and we'll keep talking
		as long as you need.
		네가 원하는 만큼
		계속 얘기하는거야
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:55	You're so sure I'm ready.
		내가 준비됐단걸 믿는구나
00:24:57	 
		 
00:25:04	And when you feel the same way...
		너도 똑같이 느낀다면
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:07	I'll be upstairs.
		위층에 있을게
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:23	Find anything yet?
		뭐 찾았어?
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	No, I looked everywhere. The place is...
		다 둘러봤어
		이 곳은..
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	The place is clean. Well, I found this.
		- 깨끗하네
		- 이걸 찾았어
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	Behind the blood in the fridge.
		냉장고 안의 피 뒤에
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:33	Oh, man, this was a real dead-end.
		정말 막다른 길인데
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	I wouldn't beat myself up over it, man.
		자책하진 말라구
00:25:37	 
		 
00:25:37	What did you think you
		were gonna find, huh?
		여기서 뭘 찾을거라 생각했어
00:25:40	 
		 
00:25:40	Isobel with a cigar and slippers?
		슬리퍼와 담배를 문
		이자벨을?
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:46	Oh, man. I...
		이런..
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	I gotta stop this. I can't...
		I can't keep searching for her.
		난 이 짓 멈춰야 해
		계속 그녀를 찾을수만 없어
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:53	Really? After only 2 years?
		정말? 2년간 그래놓고?
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:55	That's actually...
		그건 사실
00:25:57	 
		 
00:25:58	Moderately healthy.
		비교적 건전한 짓이지
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:00	What are you going on? 146?
		당신은 얼마나 찾아다녔지? 146년?
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:02	Well, I figure the 200 mark is
		probably a good stopping point.
		200년은 찍어줘야
		그만둘 수 있을것 같았어
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:08	Ahh.
		 
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	I mean, no answer is enough.
		충분한 답변은 못찾겠어
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	I keep thinking I wanna kn why,
		나는 계속 이유와
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	when, you know, the precise moment.
		날짜와 정확한 순간을
		알아내려고 하지
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:15	When my wife decided life
		with me wasn't enough.
		내 아내가 날 부족하다
		결정했던 때를 말야
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:20	She charmed me, your wife Isobel.
		자네 아내 이자벨은
		날 매혹했어
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	She talked a good game, man.
		정말 말솜씨가 좋더군
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	She was smart. She had
		this excitement in her eyes.
		똑똑한데다, 그녀의 눈에
		흥미가 있었어
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	I probably should have known there
		was something different about her,
		뭔가 특별하단 것도
		눈치챘어야 했는데
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	some tie to Katherine.
		캐더린과 연관된 것도
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:32	There had to be some
		reason I didn't kill her.
		내가 그녀를 죽이지 않은
		이유가 있을거야
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	That's enough, Damon. I
		don't wanna hear anymore.
		그거면 됐네
		듣고싶지 않아
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	I just don't want to
		waste any more of my life.
		내가 원치 않는
		답변들을 찾아다니느라
00:26:38	 
		 
00:26:38	Searching for answers
		that I really don't want.
		인생을 낭비하고 싶진 않아
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:43	I'm through with Isobel. I...
		이자벨은 이제 끝이야
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	I'm done with all of this.
		이 짓도 이제 끝낼거구
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:51	Yeah.
		그래
00:26:53	 
		 
00:27:04	Hey.
		엄마
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	What's the matter?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	I need you to pack your
		things. We're leaving.
		짐 좀 챙겨라
		떠날거야
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	What? No.
		뭐라구요? 안돼요
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:11	I was wrong to think that
		we could make a home here.
		이곳에서 새롭게 가정을
		틀겠단건 잘못 생각했던거지
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:14	It's time for us to move on.
		이제 떠날 때야
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:16	But I don't want to
		move on. I want to stay.
		난 떠나고 싶지 않아요
		여기서 지내고 싶다구요
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	We can't stay.
		여기서 살 수 없어
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:20	There's too many people
		here who know the truth...
		사실을 아는 사람이
		너무나 많아
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:23	Too much history.
		과거도 너무 많고
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	So, what, you're just gonna give up,
		그냥 포기하실 건가요?
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	pack us up, and move us out?
		짐을 챙겨서
		떠나는 거에요?
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:28	It's not safe here. You know that.
		여긴 안전하지 않아
		너도 알잖니
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	Please.
		제발요
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:32	This is about Jeremy.
		제레미 때문이구나
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:34	No. It's about me.
		아뇨. 나 때문이에요
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	Finally getting to
		build a life for myself.
		날 위한 인생을
		마침내 살아가는 중인데
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	Please, mama.
		엄마, 제발
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	You gave me my life back. I am
		just trying to protect yours.
		넌 내 삶을 돌려줬지
		난 네 삶을 지켜주려는 거야
00:27:45	 
		 
00:27:47	I can't force you.
		강요할 순 없다
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	It's your decision.
		네가 결정해
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:58	Ugh. God. You're still here?
		세상에
		아직도 있었니?
00:28:01	 
		 
00:28:01	Were you expecting anything else? No.
		다른걸 기대하셨나요? / 아니
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	Ahh.
		 
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:05	So, how was the "errand"?
		'볼 일'은 어떻게 됐나요?
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	Futile.
		변변찮았지
00:28:10	 
		 
00:28:10	Although, I think I
		witnessed the teacher having.
		하지만 목격한게 있어
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	An existential crisis.
		선생의 실존적 고비를
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:13	Has Stefan eaten yet?
		스테판은 뭐 먹었니?
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:15	I thought you didn't care.
		신경 안 쓰시는 줄 알았는데
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.
		병적인 호기심때문에
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:19	I think he's getting there.
		돌아오는 것 같아요
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	But he's got a lot of guilt
		that he has to deal with.
		하지만 대면해야 할
		죄책감이 너무나 많죠
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	And it doesn't help that
		you've spent the last 145 years.
		캐더린이 잡힌걸로
		당신이 145년간
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:28	Punishing him for
		Katherine getting caught.
		그에게 벌줬으니
		도움이 안되죠
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:31	This is my fault now?
		이젠 내 탓이야?
00:28:32	 
		 
00:28:32	No, it's no one's fault, Damon.
		아뇨, 아무의 탓도 아녜요
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	I'm just... saying you're
		not exactly innocent.
		그냥.. 당신도
		결백하지만은 않다구요
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:37	You've made it your life's
		mission to make him miserable.
		당신의 인생의 목표가
		그를 불행하게 만드는거였잖아요
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:43	Let me ask you a question.
		하나 질문하지
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	In all this important soul-searching.
		영혼의 탐구와
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	And cleansing of the
		demons of Stefan's past,
		스테판 과거의 악마들을
		정화하겠단 것 말고
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:49	did you ever manage to
		get e rest of the story?
		나머지 이야기는
		제대로 듣긴 했니?
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	He said there was more.
		안 한 얘기가
		더 있다고는 했어요
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:53	Yeah. That's an understatement.
		그래. 줄잡아 말한거지
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	Damon...
		데이먼
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	Damon.
		데이먼
00:28:59	 
		 
00:28:59	Tell me.
		말해줘요
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:11	What are you doing? Who is that?
		뭐 하는 거야?
		누구야?
00:29:14	 
		 
00:29:14	I brought her for you.
		형을 위해 데려왔어
00:29:16	 
		 
00:29:16	She's a gift. Have a seat, please.
		내 선물이야
		앉아, 제발
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:24	What have you done, Stefan?
		무슨 짓을 한거냐, 스테판?
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:26	Damon, I've been to see father.
		데이먼, 난 아버지를 보러 갔어
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	He came at me.
		날 공격했어
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	I didn't know my own strength.
		There was blood everywhere.
		내 힘이 얼마나 강한지 몰랐어
		전부 피 투성이였어
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:34	He was dying, and the
		blood was too strong.
		죽어가고 계셨고
		피가 너무나 강했어
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	I needed it. I had to have it.
		나한테 필요했어
		먹어야만 했다구
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:40	- You fed. 
		- Yes. And it's incredible.
		- 아버지 피를 마셨구나
		- 그래. 정말 놀라웠어
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:42	My body is exploding
		with power, Damon. No.
		내 몸이 힘으로
		폭발하고 있어 / 아니
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:46	I can hear things from far away.
		멀리 있는 것도
		들을 수 있어
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:49	I can see through the darkness.
		I can move, like it's magic.
		어둠 속에서 볼 수 있고
		마법처럼 움직일 수도 있어
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	And the guilt, the pain...
		Damon, I can turn it off.
		죄책감과 고통..
		모두 끌 수 있어
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	Like a switch.
		스위치처럼
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	Katherine was right. It's a whole
		another world out there, Damon.
		캐더린이 맞았어
		완전 새로운 세계가 있어
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	Katherine is dead, Stefan.
		캐더린은 죽엉써
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	- There's no world without her. 
		- No.
		그녀 없는 세상은 없어 / 아니
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:05	You can turn that off, too.
		그것도 끌 수 있어
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:07	You don't have to feel that pain anymore.
		더이상 고통을
		느끼고 싶아도 돼
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	I don't want it.
		원치 않아
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	You're weak. You'll be dead soon.
		형은 약해졌어
		곧 죽을거야
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	You need this.
		이게 필요해
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	No. You'll die.
		죽게 될거라구
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:17	No. I can't.
		안돼. 그럴 수 없어
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	Please.
		제발
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:33	I won't let you die.
		죽게 두지 않을거야
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	No. I can't.
		안돼
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:36	Don't fight it.
		싸워내지 마
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	We can do this... together.
		할 수 있어.. 같이
00:30:41	 
		 
00:31:15	From the moment Stefan had
		his first taste of human blood,
		스테판이 처음으로
		인간피를 맛본 순간부터
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	he was a different person.
		다른 사람 되었지
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:20	I suppose I should thank him.
		그한테 감사해야겠지
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	It's been a hell of a ride. Heh.
		정말 끝내주는 경험이었으니
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die.
		세상에. 죽고 싶다고 했는데
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	That's why he wot feed.
		Now I understand why, but...
		그래서 굶고 있는거고
		그 이유를 알겠는데..
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:31	His choice.
		그의 선택이야
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	If he's stupid enough
		to make it, so be it.
		바보처럼 그러고 싶다면
		그러라고 해
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:36	Don't do that. Ok? Don't
		pretend like you don't care.
		그러지 마요
		신경 안쓰는 척 말예요
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:42	Where are you going?
		어디가게?
00:31:44	 
		 
00:32:14	Hey.
		안녕
00:32:15	 
		 
00:32:15	It's getting impossible
		to sneak up on you.
		너 몰래 들어오기 힘들어지네
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:17	Nice try, though.
		시도는 좋았어
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:19	Sorry I woke you.
		깨워서 미안해
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:22	That's OK.
		괜찮아
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:24	You only woke me halfway.
		도중에 깨운것 뿐이니까
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:30	So, listen. I...
		있지
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:33	That feels good.
		기분이 좋다
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:53	Good-bye.
		잘 있어
00:32:55	 
		 
00:33:18	How do you feel?
		기분이 어때?
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	You were right.
		네 말이 맞았어?
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:22	It is a whole new world.
		완전히 새로운 세계야
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:24	We can explore it together.
		같이 탐험하자고
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:29	You got what you wanted...
		You and me for all eternity.
		네가 원하는걸 이뤘군
		함께 영생을 살게 됐지
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:34	But here it is, brother.
		하지만 문제가 있어
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	I will make it an eternity.
		나는 영원히
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	Of misery for you.
		너한테 불행을 선사할거야
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:44	Damon!
		데이먼!
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:56	You've transitioned.
		완전히 변화했군요
00:33:59	 
		 
00:34:00	You'd have rather found me dead?
		내가 죽길 바라는 건가?
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:02	Katherine saved my life once. I owed her.
		캐더린은 날 한번 살려줬죠
		신세를 갚아야 했구요
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	That doesn't mean I'd
		wish her curse on anyone.
		그렇다고 모두에게
		저주를 내리길 원치 않아요
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:10	It feels more like a gift.
		저주라기 보단
		선물같은 느낌인데
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:12	- That will change. 
		- Why is that?
		- 변할거에요
		- 왜 그렇지?
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:20	Because even in death,
		죽음 속에서도
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	your heart is pure, Stefan.
		당신의 마음은
		순수했거든요
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	I sense that about you.
		당신에게 느껴져요
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:29	That will be your curse.
		그게 당신의
		저주가 될겁니다
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:33	Emily, wait.
		에밀리, 잠깐
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:43	Stefan.
		스테판
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:50	Damon told me the rest of the story.
		데이먼이 나머지
		얘기를 해줬어
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:53	I thought I might find you here.
		여기서 찾을 수 있을것 같았어
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:56	I should have died that night,
		그날 밤 죽었어야 했어
00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:58	just like I had chosen.
		내가 택했던 결정대로
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	I should have let Damon die, too.
		데이먼도 죽게
		내버려뒀어야 했고
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:05	But you didn't. And if you die now,
		하지만 안 죽었잖아
		지금 죽는다고 해도
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:08	it's not gonna change what happened.
		그 때 일어났던 일을
		바꾸지 못해
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:11	Every single person that's been hurt...
		상처받은 사람 하나하나..
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	Every single life that's
		been lost, it's because of me.
		잃어버린 삶들 하나하나
		다 나 때문이야
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:24	The night that my parents died...
		우리 부모님이
		돌아가신 날 밤
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	I blew off family night so that
		I could go off to some party.
		난 파티에 가려고
		가족들만의 저녁을 빠져나왔지
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	I ended up getting stranded,
		and they had to come pick me up.
		그러다가 길을 잃어서
		부모님들이 데리러 오셔야 했어
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:34	That's why we ended up in
		the car at Wickery bridge.
		그래서 결국 차를 타고
		위커리교에 가게 된 거고
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:38	And that's why they died.
		그래서 부모님이 돌아가셨어
00:35:41	 
		 
00:35:41	Our actions are what set things in motion.
		우리의 행동들이
		상황을 바꾸지
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	But we have to live with that.
		하지만 그걸 안고
		살아가야만 해
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:52	I made a choice, Elena.
		난 선택을 했어, 엘레나
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	And because of that choice,
		a lot of people were hurt.
		그 선택 때문에
		많은 사람들이 다쳤지
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	You also made a choice to stop,
		멈추는 선택을 했잖아
00:35:59	 
		 
00:35:59	to reject the person
		that the blood made you.
		피 때문에 변한
		네 모습을 거부하는 선택을
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:01	- You made a choice to be good, Stefan. 
		- No.
		착해지는 선택을 했잖아 / 아니
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:03	Please don't do that. That's the person
		제발 그러지 마
		넌 바로
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:05	who jumped in the water
		to save the family
		물 속으로 뛰어들어서
		가족을 구했지
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:07	whose car had driven
		off the bridge. Please.
		다리 밖으로 빠진
		차를 구하려고
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:09	Don't make this all OK. That's the person.
		- 괜찮은 척 하지 마
		- 바로 그런 사람이야
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:12	- Who saved my life.
		- You don't understand, Elena.
		- 내 인생을 구해줬지
		- 이해를 못해
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:14	Then tell me. It hurts me.
		- 얘기해 봐
		- 너무 아파
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	It hurts me, knowing what
		I've done, and that pain...
		내가 저지른 일들과
		그 고통이 상처가 돼
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:20	That pain is with me all the time.
		그 고통이 늘 함께하지
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	And every day, I think that if I just...
		매일 나는 그저..
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	If just give myself over to the blood,
		피를 끊는다면
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	I can make that pain stop.
		고통이 사라질 줄 알았어
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	It would be that easy, and
		every day, I fight that.
		그렇게 쉬울 거라고
		매일 그렇게 싸웠지
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:34	And I am so terrified that one day,
		하지만 난 두려워
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	I'm not gonna want to
		fight that anymore, Elena.
		훗날 내가 싸워내지
		못하게 될까봐
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:41	And the next time I hurt somebody...
		다음 번에 내가
		누군가를 해친다면
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	It could be you.
		네가 될지 몰라
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	There will be no next time.
		다음 번이란 없어
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:48	You don't know that.
		모르는 소리야
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	Maybe I don't.
		그래 모를거야
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	But what I do know.
		하지만 내가 아는건
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	Is that you can take this,
		이 반지를 받고
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:58	throw it in the quarry,
		and let the sun rise.
		채석장에 던지고
		해가 뜨기만을 기다려
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	Or you could take this ring and put it on.
		아니면 이 반지를 받고 끼는거야
00:37:04	 
		 
00:37:04	And keep fighting.
		그리고 계속 맞서 싸우고
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:19	It's your choice.
		네가 결정해
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:32	Elena.
		엘레나
00:37:33	 
		 
00:38:08	- Thank you, Harper. 
		- You're welcome
		- 고맙네, 하퍼
		- 천만에요
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	Annabelle should be back in a minute.
		애나벨이 곧 돌아올텐데
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:13	You know, you don't have to come
		with us if you don't want to.
		원치 않으면
		같이 가지 않아도 되네
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	This was never my home, miss pearl.
		이 곳은 절대로
		제 집이 아녔는걸요, 펄 양
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:17	I was just a soldier who was left to die.
		전 죽은채 버려졌던
		군인이었을 뿐이죠
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:19	You saved me. I'm coming with you.
		절 구해주셨으니
		따라갈겁니다
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:22	Let me help you with these.
		내가 도와주지
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:53	- I'll be upstairs, OK?
		- Ok.
		- 위층에 있을게
		- 알았어
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:56	Good night, Damon.
		좋은 밤 되세요, 데이먼
00:38:59	 
		 
00:39:05	- Thank you. 
		- No, Stefan, thank you.
		- 고마워
		- 아니, 스테판. 고마워
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:08	You're back on Bambi blood, and
		I'm the big badass brother again.
		넌 밤비 피를 먹기 시작했고
		난 다시 못된 형이 됐군
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	All is right in the world.
		세상이 무사하네
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:12	I mean it.
		진심이야
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	Thank you.
		고마워
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	For... helping her take care of me.
		엘레나가 날 돌보게끔 도와준거
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	You brood too much. Everything
		on this planet is not your fault.
		넌 너무 생각을 많이해
		지구상의 모든게 네 잘못만은 아냐
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	My actions, what I do,
		it's not your fault.
		내 행동, 내가 하는건
		네 잘못이 아니구
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	I own them. They belong to me.
		내가 선택한 거야
		내 꺼라구
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:25	You are not allowed to feel my guilt.
		죄책감 느낄 필요 없어
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:29	Do you feel guilt?
		형은 죄책감 느껴?
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:31	If I wanted to,
		원한다면
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:32	it's there.
		늘 있지
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:45	Emily waited till after I turned
		to tell me she'd been successful.
		에밀리는 내가 변하고 나서야
		성공했는지 물어보러 왔지
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	In protecting Katherine with her spell.
		캐더린이 주문에 봉인된걸
		말하지 않았어
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:50	She didn't want me to know about the tomb.
		내가 무덤에 대해
		알길 원치 않았어
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:52	She thought it would impact my decision.
		내 선택에 영향을 줄까봐
00:39:55	 
		 
00:39:55	She didn't want either one of us to turn.
		에밀리는 우리 둘 다
		뱀파이어가 되길 원치 않았지
00:39:57	 
		 
00:39:57	She said it was a curse. Witches...
		저주랬어
00:39:58	She said it was a curse. Witches...
		 
00:39:58	She said it was a curse. Witches...
		마녀들이란
		참 비판적인 것들이지
00:40:00	 
		마녀들이란
		참 비판적인 것들이지
00:40:00	Judgy little things.
		마녀들이란
		참 비판적인 것들이지
00:40:02	 
		 
00:40:02	Why didn't you tell me?
		왜 말 안했어?
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:04	'Cause I didn't want you to know.
		네가 알길 원치 않았거든
00:40:06	 
		 
00:40:06	'Cause I hated you, and I still do.
		널 증오하니까
		아직도 그렇고
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:09	I know.
		알아
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	But not because you forced me to turn.
		네가 강요해서 된게 아냐
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	Then why?
		그러면 왜?
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:21	Because she turned you.
		그녀가 널 뱀파이어로 만들었잖아
00:40:23	 
		 
00:40:24	It was just supposed to be me, Stefan...
		내가 됐어야 했는데, 스테판..
00:40:27	 
		 
00:40:27	Just me.
		나 혼자만
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:34	I'm back.
		돌아왔어요
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:39	Oh!
		 
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:41	Mom! Mama!
		엄마!
00:40:43	 
		 
00:40:47	Uhh!
		 
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:48	Please don't leave me again.
		제발 날 떠나지 마요
00:40:51	 
		 
00:40:51	No. Please wake up. You have to wake up.
		제발 깨어나요
		일어나셔야만 해요
00:40:54	 
		 
00:40:54	No.
		안돼
00:40:58	 
		 
00:41:07	Sheriff Forbes, John Gilbert.
