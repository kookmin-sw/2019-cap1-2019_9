		제가 범이이라구요?
		장난하는 거죠?
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	No. You're self-possessed.
		You're strong-willed.
		아뇨, 침착하고
		의지도 강하고
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	You believe that violence
		can solve problems...
		무력으로
		해결하려 하고
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	That's the army thing.
		군대 처럼요
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	I'm a soldier, so I killed him?

00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	Well, you despised him.
		경멸했잖아요
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:40	You had zero reaction to his death.

00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:58	Justin beat my sister.
		제 동생을
		때렸으니까요
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	He'd get drunk and slap her around.

		살인자의 손에
		목숨을 맡기는 거요
00:33:59	 
		 
00:34:00	I find that bothersome,
		난 신경 쓰이는데
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:02	but you seem fine with it.
		요원께선
		아닌 것 같소
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:08	Are we done?
		끝났어요?
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:10	We are.
		그렇소
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:20	I'm proud of you.

		- 고마워
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:23	So how about I take you to lunch?
		점심 먹을래?
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	I have something special planned.
		이벤트가 있는데
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:27	Yeah. All right. Yeah?
		좋아
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:30	You paid Gorman to kill Justin,
		고먼을 시켜
		저스틴을 살해했고
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	and when you realized Trina could I.
		D. Gorman,
		그를 알아보는
		트리나도 죽이려 했죠
00:34:34	 
		그를 알아보는
		트리나도 죽이려 했죠
00:34:34	you put a hit out on her, too.
		그를 알아보는
		트리나도 죽이려 했죠
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:36	Yeah, like you can prove that.
		증명해 보시오
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	Did you get this from the girl?
		애한테 들었나요?
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	Anything she says under
		hypnosis is inadmissible.
		최면에 의한 증언은
		인정 안 돼요
00:34:42	 
		최면에 의한 증언은
		인정 안 돼요
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:42	Oh. Oh. No, no, no.
		I never hypnotized Trina.
		아뇨, 최면걸지
		않았습니다
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	 
		이모도 안심시켜야 했고
00:34:45	Much to the relief of her aunt, I must say,
		이모도 안심시켜야 했고
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	 
		트리나는
		기억이 없었어요
00:34:48	Trina never remembered anything.
		트리나는
		기억이 없었어요
00:34:50	 
		트리나는
		기억이 없었어요
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	I did it to lure Gorman out,
		and it worked a treat.
		고먼을 속인 건
		바로 접니다
00:34:54	 
		고먼을 속인 건
		바로 접니다
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:54	And we do have the proof, and
		not just the bag of meth
		증거도 있어요
		고먼의 집에서
00:34:57	 
		 
00:34:57	we found at Gorman's, but
		also your bank records.
		마약을 찾았죠
		게다가 계좌를 보니
00:35:00	 
		마약을 찾았죠
		게다가 계좌를 보니
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:00	You paid Gorman 10 grand for each hit.
		 
00:35:00	You paid Gorman 10 grand for each hit.
		당신 계좌에서
		출금될 때마다
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	 
		고먼 계좌에 똑같은
		양이 입금되더군요
00:35:03	Every time Gorman made a deposit,
		고먼 계좌에 똑같은
		양이 입금되더군요
00:35:05	 
		고먼 계좌에 똑같은
		양이 입금되더군요
00:35:05	the same amount came out of your account.
		고먼 계좌에 똑같은
		양이 입금되더군요
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	What are the chances?
		In the six years Gorman worked for you,
		- 기막힌 우연인가?
		- 고먼과 일한 6년간
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	it looks like you
		commissioned five murders.
		5번의 살인을
		지시했군요
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	It seems like we're gonna
		close some open cases.
		미해결 사건도
		해결하겠는데?
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	And I think he's gonna look
		great in an orange jumpsuit.
		죄수복이
		꽤 어울리겠어
00:35:17	And I think he's gonna look
		great in an orange jumpsuit.
		 
00:35:17	And I think he's gonna look
		great in an orange jumpsuit.
		어떻게 고먼인 줄 아셨소?
00:35:17	 
		어떻게 고먼인 줄 아셨소?
00:35:17	So if the girl didn't say anything to you,
		어떻게 고먼인 줄 아셨소?
00:35:19	 
		어떻게 고먼인 줄 아셨소?
00:35:19	how did you get on to Gorman?
		어떻게 고먼인 줄 아셨소?
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	That lovely hockey Jersey.
		You're from Boston. Oh, come on.
		하키 셔츠와
		고향을 봤죠
00:35:22	That lovely hockey Jersey.
		You're from Boston. Oh, come on.
		 
00:35:23	That lovely hockey Jersey.

		같은 블록에
		살았던데요?
00:35:28	You guys even grew up on the same block.
		같은 블록에
		살았던데요?
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:30	Yeah. How do you like them apples?

00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:39	Hi. Thank you for coming.
		I-I don't know what's wrong.
		와주셨군요
		이유를 모르겠어요
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	Not at all. I brought Lisbon along,
		아닙니다
		못 믿으실까봐
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:43	on account of you don't trust me,
		리스본도
		데려왔어요
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	 
		내가 금연
		도와드렸어
00:36:44	despite the fact that I
		helped her quit smoking.

00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:49	No good deed goes unpunished.
		괜한 선의엔
		대가가 따르지
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:59	You remember now, don't you?
		이제 기억나지?
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:02	Remember what?
		뭘요?
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:06	It's okay. You can say.
		말해보렴
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:08	You're safe here.
		여긴 안전해
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:13	I remember what happened.
		그 날 일이
		기억났어요
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:17	I did it.
		저였어요
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:19	 
		제가 했어요
00:37:19	It was me.
		제가 했어요
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:23	What is she talking about?
		무슨 말이야?
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	It was Trina who shot her father.
		트리나가
		아빠를 쏜 거야
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:28	No. No. That marshal shot Justin.
		아뇨, 고먼이
		쐈다면서요?
00:37:31	 
		아뇨, 고먼이
		쐈다면서요?
00:37:31	That's what you said.
		아뇨, 고먼이
		쐈다면서요?
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:33	Well, technically Gorman
		was hired to kill Justin.
		고용된 건 맞아요
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:36	He snuck onto the property,
		집에 침입은 했지만
		죽이진 않았던 거죠
00:37:37	 
		집에 침입은 했지만
		죽이진 않았던 거죠
00:37:37	but he never got to the killing part.
		집에 침입은 했지만

00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:48	What the hell?
		뭐야?
00:37:48	What the hell?
		 
00:37:49	 
		 
00:37:50	But Gorman's killed a lot of other people,
		어쨌든 고먼은
		살인을 했었으니
00:37:51	 
		어쨌든 고먼은
		살인을 했었으니
00:37:51	so, meh, you know, good riddance.
		어쨌든 고먼은
		살인을 했었으니

00:37:53	so, meh, you know, good riddance.
		잘 된 일이죠
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:56	Essex didn't know that Gorman had failed.
		 
00:37:56	Essex didn't know that Gorman had failed.
		에식스는 실패한 줄
		모르고 돈을 지불했어

		에식스는 실패한 줄

00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	Exactly. That's why
		Gorman came after Trina.
		 
00:38:00	Exactly. That's why
		Gorman came after Trina.
		그래서 트리나를
		없애려 한 거야
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	He couldn't very well explain to Essex
		에식스한테 설명하기
		힘들었던 거지
00:38:07	 
		에식스한테 설명하기
		힘들었던 거지
00:38:07	that he'd cheated him

		트리나가
		죽였으니까
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:13	Trina, why?
		트리나, 대체 왜?
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:20	Justin murdered her mother.
		아빠가 엄마를
		죽였으니까
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:23	 
		그건 자살이었어요
00:38:23	I-it was suicide.
		그건 자살이었어요
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:25	Justin got these from a bar in Reno...
		저스틴은 이걸
		'레노'에서 가져왔죠
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:28	Where Molly died.
		몰리가 죽은 모텔요
00:38:30	 
		몰리가 죽은 모텔요
00:38:30

00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:46	I was just looking for
		something to light a candle,
		성냥을 찾고 있었는데
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	and... when I...
		찾다가
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:51	I found these.
		이걸 발견했어요
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:55	I-I don't get it, dad.
		'레노'에 가본 적
		없다면서요?
00:38:56	 
		'레노'에 가본 적
		없다면서요?
00:38:56	You said you've never been there.
		'레노'에 가본 적
		없다면서요?
00:38:58	 
		 
00:39:01	Come here!
		이리 와!
