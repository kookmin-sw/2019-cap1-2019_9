00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	Called and left a message.

00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	She's in virginia beach
		with her boyfriend,
		남자친구하고
		버지니아 해변에 계셔
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	So...we'll see how long

		근데 실종된 야영객이 있다는
		소문이 돌아
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	Did she say what
		kind of animal it was
		that attacked her?
		어떤 동물의 공격을
		당했는지 알아?
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	She said it was a vampire.
		뱀파이어였대
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	What?
		뭐라고?
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	Yeah, she wakes up last night
		and mutters "vampire"
		어젯밤에 깨어나서는
		뱀파이어라고 중얼거렸어
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	And then passes out.
		그러더니 다시 쓰러졌어
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:28	Ok, that is weird.
		그거 이상하네
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	I think she was drunk.
		취했던 것 같아
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:33	So what's up with you
		and the new guy?
		새로 온 전학생하곤
		어떤 사이야?
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:39	Matt, the last thing

		맷, 난 절대로 너한테

00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	You know, i'm--

00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	I'm actually gonna go back

00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	I want to be there
		when vickie wakes up,
		동생 비키가 깨어나면

00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	Get the real story

00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	Ok.
		알았어
00:07:53	 
		 
00:08:04	As jeremy's teacher,
		i'm concerned.
		제레미 선생님으로
		염려가 됩니다
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	All right? it's
		the third day of school
		개학 후 삼일이 지났는데
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	And he's skipped
		6 of his classes.
		수업을 벌써 6번이나 빠졌어요
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	Mr. tanner,
		선생님
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	Are you aware that
		jeremy and elena's
		parents died?
		제레미랑 엘레나의
		부모님이 돌아가신거 아시죠?
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	4 months ago,
		a great loss.
		4개월 전이요
		정말 상심이 컸어요
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	Car accident.
		차 사고였죠
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	Wickery bridge,
		if i remember
		correctly.
		제 기억이 확실하다면
		위커리교에서 말이죠
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	And you're related
		to the family how?
		가족과는 어떤 관계시죠?
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	The, uh, mother's
		kid sister?
		어머님의 사촌인가요?
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	Younger sister.
		동생이에요
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	Right.
		yes.
		그렇군요
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	6 classes? are you sure?
		6교시나 빠진게 정말인가요?
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	I mean,
		that's kind of hard to do.
		그러기도 정말 힘들텐데
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	Not when
		you're on drugs.
		마약을 하면 얘기가 다르죠
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	It's his attempt at
		coping, ms. summers.
		마약으로 부모님의 죽음에
		대처하려고 합니다
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	And the signs are there.
		증세가 보여요
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	He's moody, withdrawn,
		argumentative,
		변덕스러우며
		갑자기 화를 내고
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	Hungover.
		숙취 끼도 있죠
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	Are there
		any other relatives
		in the picture?
		다른 가족분들은 없나요?
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	I'm their sole guardian.
		제가 혼자 키우고 있습니다
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Uh-huh.
		 
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	Could there be?
		도와줄 다른 분들은 없나요?
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:57	What are you suggesting,
		exactly?
		무슨 말씀이시죠?
00:08:59	 
		 
00:09:00	It's an impossible
		job, isn't it,
		불가능한 일일텐데요
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	Raising two teens?
		10대 아이 둘을 키운다는게
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	It's been tough,
		힘들었어요
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:07	But, no, it's not.
		하지만 괜찮습니다
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	Wrong answer.
		틀리셨어요
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	It is an extremely
		impossible job,
		정말 힘든 일이죠
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	And anything less
		and you're not
		doing it properly.
		게다가 적절한 교육을
		하고 있지 않으시구요
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:44	Whoa!
		와
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	Vick.
		비키!
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	Vickie, hey.
		비키
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	Vick, it's matt.
		hey, what's wrong?
		오빠야
		무슨 일이야?
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	No! no!
		싫어! 싫어!
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:53	Get off!
		저리 비켜!
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	No!
		안돼!!
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	No!
		싫어!
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	No!
		싫다구!
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	It was an animal
		that attacked you.
		널 공격한 건 동물이었다
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	It came out of the night
		and jumped you.
		갑자기 불쑥 튀어나와
		널 덮쳤다
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	You blacked out.
		그리고 넌 의식을 잃었다
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	It's all you remember.
		it's all i remember.
		- 너는 그것만을 기억한다
		- 난 그것만을 기억한다
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	An animal attacked you.
		you blacked out.
		동물이 공격한 것이다
		넌 의식을 잃었다
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	It's all you remember.
		it's all i remember.
		- 너는 그것만을 기억한다
		- 난 그것만을 기억한다
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	Nurse! i need help!
		간호사 선생님! 도와주세요!
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	It's my sister.
		제 동생 때문에요
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:18	She seems fine.
		멀쩡해 보이는데요
00:10:20	 
		 
00:11:15	Bonnie: well, i was
		talking to grams,
		할머니랑 얘기하는데
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	And she said the comet
		is a sign of impending doom.
		혜성은 임박한 불운의 징조래
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	The last time it passed over
		mystic falls,
		마지막에 미스틱 폴즈에
		떨어졌을 때는
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	There was lots of death.
		so much blood and carnage,
		정말 많은 사람이 죽었대
		큰 학살이 있었대
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:23	It created a bed
		of paranormal activity.
		과학적으로 알수 없는
		일들이 일어났다나봐
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	Yeah, and then
		you poured grams
		another shot
		그래, 그리고 할머니에게
		한잔 더 드리자
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	And she told you
		about the aliens.
		외계인 얘기를 꺼내셨겠지
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	So then what?
		그리곤?
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	So then nothing.
		아무 일도 없었어
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:34	You and stefan
		talked all night?
		너랑 스테판은
		밤새 얘기만 한거야?
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	There was
		no sloppy first kiss
		갑작스런 첫키스나
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	Or touchy feely of any kind?
		스킨쉽은 없었어?
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	Nope.
		응
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	We didn't go there.
		거기까진 안갔지
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	Not even a handshake?
		악수라도?
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	I mean, elena,
		엘레나
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	We are your friends.
		우린 네 친구야
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	Ok? you are supposed
		to share the smut.
		그런 얘기들은
		털어놓으라고 있다구
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	We just talked
		for hours.
		우린 몇시간이고 얘기했어
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Ok, what is
		with the blockage?
		뭐가 방해된다고 그래?
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	Just jump his bones already!
		ok, it's easy.
		그냥 바로 덮쳐버려!
		쉬운 거야
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Boy likes girl,
		girl likes boy,
		남자가 여자를 좋아하고
		여자도 남자를 좋아하면
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	Sex.
		같이 자는거지
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	Profound.
		심오하시군
00:11:59	 
		 
00:12:01	* ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *
		 
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	Where are you going?
		어디 가?
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	Caroline's right.
		it is easy.
		캐롤라인이 맞았어
		쉬운 거야
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	If i sit here long enough,
		내가 계속 여기 앉아있기만 하면
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	I'll end up
		talking myself out of it
		나 자신을 말리게 될거야
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	Instead of doing
		what i started the day
		saying i was going to do.
		아침에 결심했던 계획을
		실행하는 게 아니라
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	* i trust you *
		 
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	I picked up dinner.
		tacos.
		저녁 사왔다
		타코야
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	I had an urge
		for guacamole.
		과카몰리를 더 사고 싶었다만
		(멕시코 요리)
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	No, i'm good, thanks.
		난 됐어
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	Eat anyway.
		it's a ruse.
		어쨌건 먹으렴
		내 계략이였어
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	I want to talk.
		얘기를 나누고 싶거든
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:25	Hey, you! come.
		야 너! 이리 와
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Sit.
		어서 앉아
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:35	Back in school,
		freshman year,
		내가 고등학교 신입생 때
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	I could eat
		my weight in nachos,
		난 나초를 정말 좋아했어
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	With extra cheese.
		치즈소스도 말야
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	It was my munchie
		food whenever
		i got stoned.
		내가 약에 취했을때 먹는
		숙취해소용 스낵이었지
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	You get high?
		이모도 마약해?
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	Did.
		했었지
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:48	Past tense.
		과거 시제야
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	But, yeah. loved it.
		그래, 좋았어
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Anything to get
		a little distraction
		인생과... 현실에서
		잠시 탈피할 수 있었지
00:12:53	 
		인생과... 현실에서
		잠시 탈피할 수 있었지
00:12:53	From life...
		reality.
		인생과... 현실에서
		잠시 탈피할 수 있었지
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	And it worked.
		효과가 있었어
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:57	For a while.
		한동안은
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Never lasts, though.
		계속 지속되진 않더라
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	Hey, i'm not saying
		i wouldn't love to
		rail back and kick it,
		다시 하고 싶다는 뜻이 아냐
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	But with a thesis looming
		논문도 곧 끝내야 하고
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	And a waistline expanding...
		허리굵기가 굵어지는 판에..
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:10	[sighs]
		 
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:18	What the--
		이런--
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	Finally you're awake.
		마침내 일어났네
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	Hey. how are you
		feeling?
		기분이 어때?
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	You look better.
		얼굴이 좋아 보인다
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:26	I was worried
		before.
		걱정했었어
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	You really had me
		freaked out with
		all that screaming.
		소리 지르는데
		정말 무서웠다고
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	Wait, what are you
		talking about?
		잠깐, 무슨 말이야?
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	You don't remember?
		기억 안나?
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:36	I feel fine.
		난 이제 괜찮아
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:40	Good, good.
		좋아
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	Doctor said you could
		come home tomorrow.
		의사 선생님은
		내일 퇴원할 수 있댔어
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:47	Vick, what attacked you
		in the woods?
		비키, 숲속에서
		널 공격한게 뭐였어?
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:52	An animal.
		동물
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	What else could it have been?
		달리 뭐가 있겠어?
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:58	Hey.
		how do you feel?
		기분이 어때?
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:02	I'm ok.
		괜찮아
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	I--i'm gonna--
		난.. 가서..
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	I'm gonna go grab a coffee.
		커피 좀 마시고 올게
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:10	Hey, jer.
		제레미
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:13	Why are you here?
		왜 여기 온거야?
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	I just wanted to see
		how you were doing.
		네가 어떤가 보러 왔어
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	Did you see that look
		on matt's face?
		우리 오빠 표정 봤니?
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	That was suspicion.
		i don't want people
		의심의 눈초리였어
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	To find out
		about us, jeremy.
		나는 다른 사람들이
		알아채길 원치 않아
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	Well, you gotta
		get over that.
		그건 좀 잊어라
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	Tyler is finally
		showing some interest.
		타일러가 마침내
		관심을 보이기 시작하는데
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	You have to get
		over that, too.
		걔도 잊고 말야
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	Do you see
		mr. concerned?
		그렇게 걱정하시는
		타일러는 왔었니?
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	Tyler? are you
		under there?
		타일러 너 침대 아래 있니?
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	No.
		없잖아
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	It's not cool
		for people to know.
		사람들이 알면 좋지 않아
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	Ok? i'm older than you,
		난 너보다 나이도 많고
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	And matt and elena
		would freak.
		우리 오빠랑 너희 누나가
		노발대발 할거야
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:44	No one's going to
		suspect anything.
		아무도 의심 안해
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	Why wouldn't i
		check on you?
		내가 안 와야할 이유가 뭐 있는데?
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	I mean, i'm the one
		who found you.
		널 발견한 건 나였는걸
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	You are?
		정말?
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	Yeah, i carried you
		out of the woods.
		응, 숲속에서 널 안고 나왔어
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:55	Thank you.
		고마워
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:59	Yeah, you're welcome.
		천만에
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:13	[ringing bell]
		 
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:28	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:37	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:49	[creaking]
		 
00:15:52	 
		 
00:16:01	[screeching]
		 
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:11	I--i'm sorry
		for barging in.
		the door was...
		몰래 들어온거 미안해요
		문이...
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:15	Open.
		열려 있었는데
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:19	You must be elena.
		엘레나군요
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	I'm damon,
		stefan's brother.
		난 데이먼이에요
		스테판 형
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:24	He didn't tell me
		he had a brother.
		형이 있는거 안 얘기해줬는데
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	Well, stefan's
		not one to brag.
		스테판은 자랑을 잘 안해요
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Please, come.
		어서 들어와요
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:30	I'm sure stefan will
		be along any second.
		스테판도 곧 올거에요
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:34	Wow.
		와
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	This is your
		living room?
		거실인가요?
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	Living room, parlor,
		sotheby's auction.
		거실 겸 응접실겸
		소더비 경매장이죠
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	It's a little kitschy
		for my taste.
		제 취향보단 질이 떨어지죠
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:45	I see why my brother's
		so smitten.
		우리 동생이 반한
		이유를 알겠네
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:48	It's about time.
		for a while there,
		그럴 때도 됐죠
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	I never thought
		he'd get over the last one.
		지난번 헤어진 여자친구를
		극복할 수 있을거라 생각 못했는데
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	Nearly destroyed him.
		거의 파멸 상태였거든요
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	The last one?
		지난 번 여자친구요?
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	Yeah.
		네
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	Katherine, his girlfriend?
		캐더린 말이죠
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:01	Oh, you two haven't
		had the awkward exes
		conversation yet.
		둘이 아직 거북한
		과거 얘기는 안 했군요
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	Nope.
		네
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	Oops. well, i'm sure
		it'll come up now.
		지금쯤 밝혀뒀을 줄 알았는데
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	Or maybe he didn't
		want to tell you
		아니면 말하고 싶지 않았나봐요
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	Because he didn't want you
		to think he was on the rebound.
		실연의 상처로 사귀는 거라
		생각하길 원치 않았나봐요
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	We all know how those
		relationships end.
		그런 관계는 결말은
		누구나 다 알잖아요
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:20	You say it like
		모든 관계는 결국 끝나게될
		운명인 듯이 말하시네요
00:17:21	 
		모든 관계는 결국 끝나게될
		운명인 듯이 말하시네요
00:17:22	Every relationship
		is doomed to end.
		모든 관계는 결국 끝나게될
		운명인 듯이 말하시네요
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	I'm a fatalist.
		난 숙명론자에요
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	Hello, stefan.
		안녕, 스테판
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:29	Elena.
		엘레나
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	I didn't know
		you were coming over.
		네가 오는 줄 몰랐어
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	I know. i should
		have called, i just--
		알아, 먼저
		연락을 했어야 되는데..
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	Oh, don't be silly.
		you're welcome any time.
		바보같은 소리 마요
		언제든 환영이니깐
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	Isn't she, stefan?
		그렇지, 스테판?
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:39	You know, i should
		break out the family
		photo albums,
		내가 가족 앨범이나
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	Or some home movies.
		홈비디오를
		꺼내야 할텐데
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	But...i have
		to warn you.
		미리 경고할게요
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	He wasn't always
		such a looker.
		어릴 땐 이렇게
		잘생기지 않았어요
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	Thank you
		for stopping by, elena.
		들러줘서 고마웠어요, 엘레나
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	Nice to see you.
		만나서 반가웠어요
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:53	Yeah, i should probably go.
		나 가봐야 겠다
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	It was nice
		to meet you, damon.
		만나서 반가웠어요, 데이먼
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Great meeting you,
		too, elena.
		나도요, 엘레나
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:09	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:25	[damon whistles]
		 
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	Great gal.
		괜찮은 아이인걸
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	Whoo. she's got spunk.
		와. 꽤 용감하던데
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:33	You, on the other hand,
		look pooped.
		반면 넌 지쳐보이는구나
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	Did you over-exert
		yourself today?
		오늘 능력을 너무
		과도하게 사용했니?
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:40	Let me guess--
		hospital.
		어디 맞춰보자
		병원에 갔지
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	Someone had to clean up
		your mess.
		형 때문에 생긴 골치거리들을
		처리할 사람이 필요했지
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	Well, were you successful?
		성공했니?
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	Did the powers
		of persuasion work?
		설득의 힘이 통해?
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	Remember, if you don't
		feed properly,
		기억해, 네가 제대로 된
		피를 빨지 못하면
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	None of those
		little tricks work right.
		그런 책략은
		올바로 먹히지 않는단걸
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	How long
		was elena here?
		엘레나는 얼마나
		여기 있었어?
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	Were you worried, stefan?
		걱정 되니, 스테판?
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	Scared we may be doomed
		우리가 과거를 반복할
		운명일까봐?
00:18:56	 
		우리가 과거를 반복할
		운명일까봐?
00:18:56	To repeat the past?
		[chuckles]
		우리가 과거를 반복할
		운명일까봐?
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Isn't that why you play
		your little game,
		"i'm a high school human"?
		그래서 니가 '인간 고등학생'
		흉내 게임을 즐기는 거야?
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	I'm not playing any game.
		of course you are.
		- 난 게임 같은거 안해
		- 물론이시겠지
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	We both know
		우린 둘다 알아
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	The closest you'll ever
		get to humanity
		내가 인간과 가까워질
		유일한 방법은
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	Is when you rip it open
		and feed on it.
		인간 목을 물고 피를 마실 때
		뿐이라는 것을
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	What kind of game
		are you playing...
		형은 어떤 게임을 하는데..
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	Damien?
		데미언?
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	Guess you'll just
		have to wait
		and see, won't you?
		네가 지켜 봐야 할 것 같은데?
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:23	Elena: he's on the rebound
		and has raging family issues.
		실연 극복 중이고
		가족 문제가 있어
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:27	Well, at least
		it's an ex-girlfriend.
		적어도 헤어졌잖니
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	Wait till you date a guy
		with mommy issues
		나중에 마마보이나
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:31	Or cheating issues.
		바람피우는 남자나
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:33	Or amphetamine issues.
		각성제 문제 있는
		남자 만나봐
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:37	Jeremy.
		제레미
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:41	Jeremy,
		where were you?
		제레미, 어디 있었니?
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	More stoner stories?
		또 마약에 쩔었니?
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	Look, jenna, i get it,
		you were cool.
		이모, 이해해
		이모는 쿨한 사람이야
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	And so that's--
		that's cool.
		방금 그것도.. 쿨했고
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:52	Oh, no, no, no!
		아니!
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	Ow! why?
		왜?
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	Why--why did you do that?
		listen up!
		- 왜 그랬어?
		- 들어봐!
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	Quit ditching class
		or you're grounded.
		또 수업 빼먹으면
		외출금지인줄 알아
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	No discussion.
		얘기 끝이야
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	Parental authority,
		i like it.
		부모 권한을 들먹인다
		맘에 드는데
00:20:03

00:23:11	Nothing with an "o" in it.
		'오'자 들어간 건 없더라
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	I think they were onto me.
		내가 하는 걸 아는 것 같아
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	Here. knock yourself
		out, literally.
		여기, 맘대로 드셔
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:19	Thanks, jer.
		고마워, 제레미
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:22	So you gonna, uh,
		watch the comet later?
		오늘 밤에 혜성 볼꺼야?
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	I hadn't really
		thought about it.
		생각 안 해봤어
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	But i could be
		talked into it.
		하지만 네가 설득하면 갈수도
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	I'll meet you
		out there in a few.
		좀 있다 보자
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	Hey, vick.
		how you feeling?
		비키. 기분은 좀 어때?
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	Like you care.
		신경 쓰시는 척 하지마
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:43	What are you lookin' at,
		gilbert?
		어딜 쳐다봐, 길버트?
00:23:45	 
		 
00:23:51	Hey, i got some candles.
		초 가져왔어
00:23:53	 
		 
00:23:54	Hi.
		안녕
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:56	Hey.
		hey.
		안녕?
00:23:58	 
		 
00:24:00	Thank you.
		고마워
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:01	You're welcome.
		천만에
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:12	Stefan: thank you.
		고마워
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:16	Hi.
		안녕
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:17	Hi.
		안녕
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:42	You know, that comet...
		있지, 혜성은..
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:45	It's been traveling across
		space for thousands of years.
		몇천년 동안이나
		우주를 여행해왔어
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	All alone.
		혼자서
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:51	Yeah, bonnie says
		it's a harbinger
		of evil.
		응, 보니가 그러길
		악의 전조라네
00:24:56	 
		 
00:24:56	I think it's just
		a ball of...
		나는 그걸...
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	Snow and ice,
		눈과 얼음 덩어리로 생각해
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	Trapped on a path
		that it can't escape.
		벗어날 수 없는
		경로에 갖힌 덩어리
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	And once every 145 years,
		그리고 145년 마다
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	It gets to come home.
		고향에 도달하게 되는 거야
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:12	I'm sorry about yesterday.
		어제 일은 미안했어
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	I wasn't myself.
		나 답지 않았어
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	You seem to spend a lot
		of time apologizing.
		넌 참 사과를 많이 하는구나
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	Well, i have a lot
		to apologize for.
		응 사과할 일이 많지
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	Yesterday,
		that wasn't about you, ok?
		어제는 너 때문이 아냐
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	You didn't tell me
		that you had a brother.
		형이 있다는 사실
		말 안해 줬잖아
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:34	We're not close.
		우린 그다지 가깝지 않아
00:25:36	 
		 
00:25:36	It's, uh...
		그게..
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:38	It's complicated.
		복잡해
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	Always.
		늘 그렇지
00:25:42	 
		 
00:25:43	He told me about
		your ex, Catherine.
		네 전여친, 캐더린에 대해
		말해주더라
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	What did he say?
		뭐래?
00:25:54	 
		 
00:25:54	That she broke
		your heart.
		네 마음을 아프게 했다고
00:25:55	 
		 
00:26:01	That was a long time ago.
		오래 전 일이야
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:04	When you lose someone,
		it stays with you,
		누군가를 잃으면
		그 기억이 남아
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	Always reminding you
		of how easy it is
		to get hurt.
		상처를 받는게 얼마나 쉬운지
		떠오르게 만들지
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:18	Elena...
		엘레나..
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	It's ok, stefan.
		괜찮아, 스테판
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:21	I get it.
		이해해
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	You have no idea
		how much i get it.
		넌 내가 얼마나
		공감하는지 모를거야
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:26	Complicated
		brother? check.
		복잡한 형제관계? 확인
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:29	Complicated ex? check.
		복잡한 과거? 확인
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	Too complicated
		to even contemplate
		dating, double check.
		너무 꼬여서 데이트할
		여유도 없는거? 재차 확인
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	It's ok.
		괜찮아
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	We met, and we talked,
		우린 만나서 얘기를 나눴고
00:26:38	 
		 
00:26:38	And it was epic, but...
		특별했지만..
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	Then the sun came up
		and reality set in
		태양이 뜨고
		현실이 찾아들었어
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:55	So...
		그러니...
00:26:57	 
		 
00:27:04	[indistinct chatter]
		 
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:13	I know you.
		당신을 알아요
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:16	Well, that's unfortunate.
		그거 참 안됐군요
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:19	Um...
		 
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:21	I don't--i don't know how,
		어떻게 아는건진 모르겠어요
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:23	But...
		근데...
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:25	Your face.
		당신 얼굴이
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:30	[chuckles]
		 
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:32	Excuse me. sorry.
		미안해요
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:37	[sighs]
		 
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:46	[screaming]
		 
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:51	Hey, has anyone seen vickie?
		비키 본 사람?
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	You're her stalker.
		you tell us.
		너야말로 스토커니까
		네가 말해봐
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	I can't find her.
		찾을 수가 없어
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	She probably
		found somebody else
		to party with.
		파티할 사람을 따로 찾았나보네
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Sorry, pill pusher,
		i guess you've been
		replaced.
		마약 밀매꾼
		넌 이제 교체됐구나
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:58	What's with
		the pill pusher?
		마약 밀매꾼이라니?
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	Ask him.
		you wanna do this right now?
		- 직접 물어봐
		- 지금 이러고 싶어?
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	Are you dealing?
		너 마약 거래하니?
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	She's never
		gonna go for you.
		비키는 널
		사랑해주지 않을거야
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:05	She already did.
		벌써 빠졌는걸
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	Over and over
		and over again.
		몇번이고 계속
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	Yeah, right.
		그러셔
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	You slept
		with vickie donovan?
		비키 도너반과 잤단 거야?
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:11	I mean, vickie donovan
		slept with you?
		비키 도나반이 너랑?
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:13	There's no way.
		말도 안돼
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:15	And i didn't even have
		to force her into it.
		강요하지도 않았어
00:28:17	 
		 
00:28:17	What the hell is he
		talking about, todd?
		대체 무슨 말이야, 토드?
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:19	Nothing, man,
		just ignore him,
		he's a punk.
		아무것도 아냐
		그냥 무시해. 애송이야
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:20	You know what,
		how about all
		of you shut up
		모두들 입 다물고
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	And help me find my sister?
		we'll check the back.
		- 내 동생 찾는것좀 도와줄래?
		- 우린 뒤에서 찾아볼게
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:25	I'll check the square.
		i'll come with you.
		- 광장에 가볼게
		- 나도 같이 갈게
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	Oh, no, no, no.
		아니, 안돼
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:28	You are coming with me.
		넌 나랑 같이 가
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	So that's your game now,
		dealing?
		이젠 약장사를 하신다?
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	I'm not dealing.
		look, i'm sick
		장사 안해
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	Of the tough love speech, jer.
		it's really having no impact.
		나는 따끔한 훈계하는거 지쳤어
		아무 효과가 없잖아
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:38	You and jenna,
		between the two of you--
		너랑 이모
		둘 사이는..
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	We can stop if you want.
		원하면 그만해도 돼
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	Send you to a therapist
		where you'll be forced
		to deal with it
		상담사를 불러서
		강압적으로 대처를 하던가
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	Or to rehab where
		you'll sit in group
		재활원에 가서
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	And tell some stranger
		how you let your life
		fall apart.
		낯선사람들한테 네 인생
		망친 이야기를 하던가
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	Or you could talk to me.
		아님 나한테 말할 수 있잖아
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:53	I vote for none
		of the above.
		난 셋 다 맘에 안들어
00:28:55	 
		 
00:29:01	Hey.
		스테판
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:03	Hey.
		맷
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	Have you seen my sister?
		내 여동생 못봤어?
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:05	No, sorry.
		i can't find her.
		미안. 못찾겠어
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:07	She's missing.
		실종됐어
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:09	I'll keep
		an eye out for her.
		내가 찾아볼게
00:29:12	 
		 
00:29:12	Hey.
		스테판
00:29:14	 
		 
00:29:14	I saw you at the hospital
		yesterday.
		어제 병원에서 널 봤어
00:29:16	 
		 
00:29:19	Did you?
		그래?
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:21	What were you doing there?
		거기서 뭐했어?
00:29:23	 
		 
00:29:25	Visiting.
		방문
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:27	Visiting?
		방문?
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:32	You know,
		 
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	Elena and i, we've known
		each other for a long time.
		엘레나랑 난 오랫동안
		알고 지낸 사이야
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	We might not be together
		right now,
		우린 지금 사귀지 않겠지만
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:38	But i look out for her.
		난 그녀를 주의깊게 살핀다구
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:40	And i'll always
		look out for her.
		앞으로도 그럴거야
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:46	Damon: you really
		have to stop screaming.
		그만 소리지르시지 그래
00:29:47	 
		 
00:29:47	No, please, stop.
		don't...
		아뇨, 제발
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	Shh. i got you.
		내가 잡고 있잖아
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:52	Excuse me.
		실례해
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:59	No! no!
		안돼요!
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	I gotta do it.
		i'm not gonna drop you.
		난 널 떨어뜨리지 않을거야
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:08	Not bad.
		나쁘지 않네
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	Have you been
		eating bunnies?
		토끼 먹고 왔니?
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:11	Let her go.
		그녀를 놔줘
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	Shh. really?
		정말?
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	Ok.
		좋아
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	No!
		no, no, no!
		안돼!
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:17	Uhh!
		 
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	Relax.
		진정해
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	What's happening?
		무슨 일이야?
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	I don't need her
		to be dead, but...
		죽길 원치 않지만..
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	You might.
		그럴 수도 있어
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:29	What attacked you
		the other night?
		그날 밤 널 공격한게 뭐더라?
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:34	I don't know. an animal.
		모르겠어요. 동물이었어요
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	Are you sure
		about that?
		확실해?
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	Think.
		생각해 봐
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:40	Think about it.
		think really hard.
		생각해봐. 열심히
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:44	What attacked you?
		뭐가 널 공격했지?
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:49	A vampire.
		뱀파이어요
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	Who did this to you?
		you did!
		- 누가 널 이렇게 했지?
		- 바로 당신이!
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:54	Wrong!
		don't.
		틀렸어
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	It was stefan.
		don't.
		스테판이었어
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	Come here.
		이리 와
00:30:58	 
		 
00:31:01	Stefan salvatore
		did this to you.
		스테판 살바토어가
		널 이렇게 만들었어
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	Stefan salvatore
		did this to me.
		스테판 살바토어가
		날 이렇게 만들었다
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:07	He's a vampire.
		그는 뱀파이어다
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	A vicious,
		murderous monster.
		사악하고 잔인한 괴물
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	Please, damon.
		please don't do this.
		제발, 형
		이러지 말아
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	If you couldn't
		fix it before,
		전에 효과가 없었으면
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:15	I don't know
		what you can do now.
		지금도 못할텐데
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:19	Aah!
		 
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:22	Uhh!
		 
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:23	[sobbing]
		 
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:25	Your choice
		of lifestyle
		네가 선택한 생활신조가
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	Has made you weak.
		널 약하게 만들었어
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	A couple of vampire
		parlor tricks
		뱀파이어의 숨은 재주 몇가지는
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	Is nothing compared
		to the power that

		네가 가질수 있었던
		네가 필요한 그 능력들과
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	That you now need.
		비교도 안돼게 약해

00:31:39	But yocan
		change that.ge
		하지만 바꿀 수 있어
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	Human blood
		gives you that.
		인간 피를 먹으면
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:44	[sobbing] no!
		안돼!
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	[groaning]
		 
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	[grunting]
		you have two choices.
		두가지가 있어
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	You can feed
		and make her forget.
		피를 빨고 잊게 만들거나
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	[breathing heavily]
		 
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	Or you can let her run,
		screaming "vampire"
		through the town square.
		도망치게 둬서 광장에서
		'뱀파이어'라고 소리치게 만들어봐
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	[grunting] that's what
		this is about?
		그것 때문이야?
00:32:01	 
		 
00:32:01	You want to expose me?
		내 존재를 폭로하고 싶어?
