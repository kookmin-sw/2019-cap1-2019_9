		Buff that sucker.
		조, 잘 좀 닦아봐
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	- What'd I teach you?
		- (spits)
		내가 어떻게 하랬지?
00:00:03	 
		 
00:00:03	- (chuckles)
		- Sanitary.
		 
00:00:03	- (chuckles)
		- Sanitary.
		참 위생적이네요
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:06	Is Joe applying for a job
		in a train station in 1940?
		조가 1940년대 기차역에서 일할 거래요?
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	Just teaching him a few things
		every man should know.
		남자라면 알아야 할 것들을 
		가르치는 것 뿐이야
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	Someone has
		to get in there early,
		빨리 시작해야지
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	or sometimes the kid
		turns out funny.
		안 그럼 가끔 이상하게 크거든
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:15	Knock, knock.
		똑똑
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	- Hey, Phil.
		- Hey, guys.
		- 안녕하세요, 필
		- 안녕하세요
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	Phil, in here!
		필, 여기요!
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	PHIL: You ready
		to tackle your website?
		웹사이트랑 씨름할 준비 됐어요?
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	I know
		I'm here a little early.
		조금 일찍 온 거 아는데
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	I thought
		I was gonna be --
		제 생각엔 내가-
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:25	Do you recognize that?
		알겠어요?
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Are you kidding?
		I love your sauce.
		농담해요?
		나 글로리아 소스 엄청 좋아해요
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	Some of it fell out
		of my burrito last night,
		어젯밤에 브리또 먹다가 좀 떨어졌는데
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	and I licked it
		right off the remote.
		리모콘에 묻은 거 다 핥아먹었다구요
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	That's Auntie Alice's
		new sauce!
		그거 '앨리스 이모'의 새 소스예요!
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	She stole my recipe!
		내 레시피를 훔쳤어!
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	I know.
		알아요
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	I am the crazy Colombian
		that always loses her temper
		내가 툭하면 화내는
		별난 콜롬비아인이고
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	and needs to be calmed down
		by the white people.
		백인들이 진정시켜줘야 한다는 거
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:43	No! I don't think
		you're being crazy enough.
		아니오! 
		별나게 구는 거라고 생각 안해요
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	I'm not a violent man, but
		I know how nuts it can make you
		난 폭력적인 편이 아닌데도
		얼마나 열받는지 알죠
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	to create something special
		only to have it stolen from you.
		특별한 무언가를 만들었는데
		누군가 훔쳐간다는 게
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	Do you remember
		a hit song called "Happy?"
		'해피'라는 히트곡 알아요?
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Yeah, it was
		like a couple of years ago
		네, 2,3년 전에 들었죠
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	with the clapping
		and the hat.
		박수치고 모자나오고 뭐
00:00:58	 
		 
00:00:58	A couple of years ago, huh?
		2,3년전요?
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	So a full four years
		after this burst on the scene.

		She's Ian Jacobs' girl.

		진짜로, 루크야
		네가 지금 얘기하는 거

00:02:30	is completely confidential.
		비밀유지는 완벽하겠다
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	Oh, you know, they are looking
		for chaperones for prom,
		참, 프롬때 보호자들 구하던데
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:33	and I thought
		maybe we could --
		어쩌면 우리가 할 수..
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	No, we have tickets to the

		doing that.
		내 프롬도 그러다 다 보냈어
00:02:41

		the absurdity
		이건 너무 어이없는 거 아니니
00:02:43

		advise you and not this uncle,

00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:54	Didn't love all three of those
		being rolled into one sentence.
		세 개가 한 문장에 다 
		섞여 있는 게 맘에 안 들었어
00:02:56	 
		 
00:02:56	Sounded a little Ozark-y.
		좀 막장스럽잖니
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	- No, Cam. Stop.
		- What?
		- 안돼, 캠, 그만
		- 뭘?
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	Luke's just looking
		for an adviser
		루크가 원하는 조언자는
00:03:00

		more understated
		좀 더 절제되어 있고..

		조금 덜.. 알지

		데이비드 스튜어트요
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	Oh, I get it.
		아, 알았어
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	- He's quite gay.
		- Yes, I got it.
		- 그 사람 좀 게이같지
		- 그래
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	Okay, well, you know what?
		아 그래 그거 알아?
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	I would hate to muck up
		your promposal
		나도 네 프롬포즈를 망치기 싫어

		will swoon with delight
		그 행운의 소녀가 
		기뻐서 까무라치겠구나

		on her turkey burger.

		- No!
		- 침입자 없다구요?

		드라이아이스를 써서
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	and dry ice so Manny can appear
		in a cloud of mist.
		안개속에서 등장하는 매니에 비하면 말야
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	A cloud of mist?
		안개?
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	Like in a movie?
		영화처럼요?
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	Is our thing
		gonna seem lame now?
		우리꺼 구린 거 아녜요?
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	Steady.
		침착해
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:34	Now, now.
		I'm sure your thing is fine.
		뭐 니네 것도 괜찮을 거야
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	What did
		your little locker note say?
		사물함 쪽지엔 뭐라고 썼니?
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	"Go to the gym."
		"체육관으로 와"
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	Intriguing.
		흥미롭네
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	What delights
		await her in the gym?
		체육관에 가면 뭐가 기다리고 있니?
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	Another note telling her
		to go to the parking lot.
		주차장으로 가라는 쪽지요
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:45	Well, I should help Manny
		set up.
		흠, 난 매니 준비하러 가볼게
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	Should I be worried?
		나 걱정해야 해요?
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	Don't freak me out right now,
		okay?
		미치겠다 그러지마
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:50	- It's fine. Just fine.
		- Okay. All right.
		- 괜찮아 괜찮아
		- 알았어요
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	You don't have to use it,
		but at least you'll have it.
		꼭 쓸 필요는 없는데 
		가지고는 있어
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:58	Hello, Auntie Alice.
		안녕하세요, 앨리스 이모
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	Or should she say
		Auntie Malice?
		아니 맬리스 이모인가?
		(*malice:악의)
00:06:03	 
		 
00:06:03	No, Gloria's right.
		It's Alice.
		아니, 글로리아가 맞아요
		앨리스예요
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	I didn't know
		you were in today.
		오늘 나오는 줄 몰랐는데
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:08	You're in --
		trouble!
		당신은 큰일났는데!
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	Is he okay?
		이 사람 괜찮은가?
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	- You stole my sauce!
		- What?
		- 내 소스를 훔쳤죠!
		- 뭐?
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	Uh, I'm sorry.
		Maybe you don't hear so good.
		저런
		가는 귀가 먹으셨나봐
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	She said, "You... stole...
		뭐랬냐면
		"당신이, 훔쳤다고"
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	her... sauce."
		"그녀의, 소스를"
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:24	Wow.
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	That's spicy.
		맵네
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	That's not the sauce
		she stole.
		그 소스가 아녜요
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:29	That's her Volcano sauce.
		그건 볼케이노 소스인데
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	In her ad, one drop
		광고보면, 한방울로
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	turns a hockey rink
		into a swimming pool.
		하키링크를 수영장으로 만들어요
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	It's her new sauce, the one
		that tastes just like mine.
		베낀 건 새 소스예요,
		내꺼랑 맛이 똑같지
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	How are you going
		to explain that?
		어떻게 설명할 거예요?
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	Yeah, we want answers
		and a little bread.
		그래, 우린 대답과 빵조각을 원해
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:43	Your fight's not with me.
		나랑 싸울 일이 아니야
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:47	I'm not really Auntie Alice.
		난 사실 앨리스 이모가 아니라구
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:50	Oh, come on.
		아이고
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:52	Your cute face
		is in the bottle!
		귀여우신 얼굴이 병에 있거든요!
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	Auntie Alice is a brand that was
		created by a big corporation.
		앨리스 이모는 대기업이 만든 브랜드야
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	So they were the ones
		who stole my sauce?
		그럼 거기서 내 소스를 베낀거예요?
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	They steal
		all kinds of products.
		온갖 제품을 다 베껴
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	And they have
		an army of lawyers
		변호사도 빵빵해서
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	just ready to crush
		anyone who challenges them.
		소송해도 다 이겨버린다구
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	So we just have
		to take it?
		그럼 그냥 참아야 해요?
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:10	Ow!
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	- It's in my eye!
		- Oh!
		눈에 들어갔어!!
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	Please don't repeat any of this,
		or I could lose my job.
		또 이러진 말아줘 나 짤려
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	I'm still paying off
		my improv classes.
		즉흥연기 수업비 내야한다고!
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	How is this food?!
		무슨 음식이 이래!
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	This will
		probably be yours someday,
		언젠간 네 차가 될테니
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	so no reason
		you shouldn't learn to do this.
		지금 배우지 않을 이유가 없지
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:26	Does Manny
		know how to change oil?
		매니형도 오일 교환하는 법 알아요?
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:28	- Bath oils.
		- What?
		- 목욕 오일이나 알지
		- 뭐라고요?
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	Bath oil?
		목욕 오일?
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	There's my guy.
		바로 그거지
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	Let me grab the dipstick.
		계량봉 다오
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	This stick?
		이거요?
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:35	Ow!
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:39	Manny. Okay.
		I just briefed the team.
		매니, 좋아
		방금 준비팀이랑 회의했어
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:42	Dry ice is ready.
		Bow ties are on the birds.
		드라이아이스 준비됐고
		나비넥타이도 새에 달았어
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	Save it, Cam.
		잠깐만요
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	Megan already said yes
		to Shawn Reeves.
		메간이 숀 리브스랑 간대요
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	He asked her last period.
		지난 학기에 신청했대요
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	Oh, I'm so sorry, Manny.
		유감이구나, 매니
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	Can't really blame her.
		메간 탓도 아니죠
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:51	I mean, you try saying no
		to Shawn Reeves
		숀 리브스를 어떻게 거절하겠어요
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	with his weatherman smile
		and his exotic Canadian accent.
		기상 캐스터같은 미소에
		이국적인 캐나다 악센트라니
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	Well, there must be
		someone else you can ask.
		다른 애가 있을 거야
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	No, that's okay.
		There's always next year.
		아뇨, 괜찮아요
		내년이 있으니까
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	At least this way I can see
		the opening of "Cabaret."
		최소한 캬바레 첫공은 볼 수 있겠네요
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	Oh, please.
		It's just "Cabaret."
		됐어, 고작 캬바레가지구
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	It's been revived more times
		than Dick Cheney.
		피닉제보다도 더 많이 재상연한다고
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	Okay.
		You're not missing your prom.
		프롬을 안 가면 안돼
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	Cam...
		I'm getting the feeling
		왠지 이 일이 나보다
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	this is much more important
		to you than it is to me.
		형한테 더 중요해 보이네요
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	Well, maybe because
		I didn't get to go to mine.
		내가 프롬을 못 가서 그런가보네
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	Oh. I'm sorry.
		아.. 죄송해요
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	Yeah, it's a painful story.
		(chuckles)
		됐어, 가슴 아픈 이야기야
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	I get it. Some things
		are better left unsaid.
		알겠어요
		말하지 않는 게 나을 때도 있죠
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	Her name was Tina Day.
		걔 이름은 티나 데이였어
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	We were just friends,
		but I was so into asking her,
		우린 그냥 친구사이였지만
		같이 가고 싶었어
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	I rented a white stallion
		and a suit of armor.
		하얀 말과 갑옷을 빌렸지
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	I wanted it to be a whole
		"Knight and Day" theme.
		"낮과 기사" 테마로 하고 싶었거든
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	- (chuckles)
		- Hm.
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	I was promposing
		before it was even a thing.
		프롬포즈가 유행타기도 전이었어
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	I rode up her driveway,
		그 애 집앞에 가서
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	and I could see
		when she opened the door
		걔가 문을 열었을 때 알았지
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	through the little slits
		in my helmet
		내 투구사이로 보였어
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	what her answer
		was gonna be.
		그 애의 대답이 말야
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	She wanted
		a traditional prom night
		평범한 프롬의 밤을 보내길 원했던 거야
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	with a guy
		she could lose her virginity to.
		순결을 잃을 수 있는 남자와 함께
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:45	I couldn't blame her.
		걔 탓이 아니지
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	I wanted the same thing.
		나도 같은 걸 바랐거든
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	- (chuckles)
		- (sighs)
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	There's always
		Melanie Rylance,
		멜라니 라일런스라고 있긴 한데
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:52	but you wouldn't want me
		to ask someone --
		그런 애한테 신청하는 건 별로겠-
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Delta, ready the dancers
		and dove cannon.
		델타팀, 댄서랑 비둘기 준비해
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:56	Poor lady.
		가엾은 아주머니
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	I feel terrible for screaming
		at her like that.
		소리친 게 너무 미안해요
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	I blame myself.
		내 탓이에요
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	I blame yourself, too.
		그래요, 당신 탓이에요
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	I'm sorry.
		미안해요
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	I'm just kind of
		going through something.
		오늘 일이 좀 있었어요
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	I got bumped from Lily's
		career day this morning
		릴리네 학교 직업의 날에서 밀렸거든요
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	by a periodontist.
		치주병학자한테
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	That's right -- My job is
		less interesting that root rot.
		맞아요 - 제 직업은
		잇몸병보다 재미가 없어요
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	Who cares about a bunch
		of third graders?
		초딩들 생각이 뭐가 중요해요?
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	You love
		being a real-estate agent.
		부동산 중개인 일 사랑하잖아요
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	First of all, I'm not
		just a real-estate agent.
		우선, 난 단순한 부동산 중개인이 아니에요
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	I'm a Realtor.
		부동산 중개업자예요
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:23	I'm a member of a national
		association, a brotherhood,
		전미 부동산 중개업자 협회 회원으로서
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	sworn to
		the Realtor Code of Ethics!
		부동산 중개업자 윤리 규범을 지킨다구요
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:28	That's what
		this "R" stands for.
		그게 이 "R" 의 의미예요
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	Though, lately, it feels
		like it stands for "regret."
		요즘엔 "후회"를 의미하는 것 같지만
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	I know everything there is
		to know about real estate,
		부동산의 모든 걸 알고 있는데
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	and nobody seems to care.
		아무도 신경쓰지 않아요
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	Maybe I have the most boring
		job in the world.
		세상에서 제일 지루한 직업인 것 같아요
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	No, Phil.
		아니에요, 필
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	Closets is the most boring job
		in the world.
		벽장이 제일 지루해요
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	(gasps)
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	Ay, poor thing.
		아이, 불쌍한 사람
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	She has to take the bus.
		버스 타나봐요
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	Let's offer her a ride.
		태워다 드려요
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	Yes, yes.
		그래요
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	(car alarm chirps)
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:55	A Maserati?
		마세라티?
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	She lied to us!
		거짓말을 했어!
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:59	(engine revs)
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:01	- iSiguela!
		- iSiguela!
		- iSiguela!
		- iSiguela!
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	No,
		that means "follow her."
		아니, '쫓아가' 란 말이에요
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	Oh.
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:10	(cellphone rings)
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	- Hello?
		- ALEX: Hey, Mom.
		- 여보세요?
		- 엄마
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	How do you turn on the
		sprinklers for the front lawn?
		마당에 스프링클러 어떻게 켜요?
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	Uh, it's a little control box
		by the front door.
		문 옆에 콘트롤 박스가 있어
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	- Why?
		- No reason.
		- 왜?
		- 아녜요
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	Look, now that I've got you
		on the phone,
		있지, 전화하는 김에
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:24	I'm thinking it might be time to
		upgrade our Internet security.
		인터넷 보안을 
		좀 강화해야할 것 같은데
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	Thoughts?
		좋은 생각 있니?
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	Get rid of the Post-it note
		on your laptop
		엄마 노트북에 포스트잇 떼어내요
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	with your password on it.
		비밀번호 적어 놓은 거
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Why are you so worried
		about security?
		보안은 왜 걱정하세요?
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:33	It's my first ClosetCon
		as C.E.O.,
		CEO로 가는 첫 벽장컨벤션인데
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	and I am dealing
		with corporate espionage.
		산업 스파이를 상대해야 해
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	Well, if you're so worried
		about it,
		그렇게 걱정되시면
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	why don't you
		just call Grandpa?
		할아버지한테 전화해보세요
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	Do you know
		how that would look?
		그게 어떤 꼴일지 아니?
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	I mean, it's bad enough
		to go to the person
		자기 전임이었던 사람한테
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	who had your job before you,
		가는 것만도 이미 최악인데
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	but when that person
		is Daddy...
		그 사람이 아빠라니..
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Honey, closet people
		are ruthless.
		벽장계 사람들은 무자비해
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	They'd eat me alive.
		날 산 채로 잡아먹을거야
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	Or maybe the world isn't filled
		with heartless monsters.
		혹은 세상이 괴물 천지는 아닐지도요
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	(knock on door)
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:59	Hi.
		My phone is wet.
		안녕
		내 폰이 젖어서 그런데
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Can you call my mom?
		우리 엄마한테 전화 좀 해줄래?
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:03	Hey, guys.
		Sorry I'm late.
		안녕, 여러분
		늦어서 미안해요
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	I just got off the horn
		방금 쉘프 인볼브드사의 
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	with Rick Friedman
		over at Shelf Involved.
		릭 프리드만이랑 통화했는데
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	That poor guy.
		너무 안됐지 뭐예요
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	Someone there has given away
		corporate secrets. (scoffs)
		누가 회사 기밀을 누설했대요
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	Makes me so glad
		우리로선 다행인게
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	that we just upgraded
		our whole security system.
		보안 시스템을 막 업그레이드 했거든요
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	I mean, we got hidden cameras
		around this place
		사방에 카메라들이 숨겨져있는데
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	that I don't even know about.
		(chuckles)
		나도 어딘지 모르겠네요
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:25	So, we got a cake
		for Margaret's birthday.
		마가렛 생일 케이크를 샀는데..
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:29	Mm-hmm.
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	Fun.
		재밌겠네
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	- How you doing, Ben?
		- (gulps)
		별 일 없어, 벤?
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:34	(chuckles nervously)
		Me?
		저요?
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	I'm good.
		I am good.
		좋아요, 좋아
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	I am chill.
		아주 좋죠
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	I'm gonna go
		to the bathroom, so...
		화장실에 좀 갈게요
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:41	It's not really my birthday.
		사실 제 생일 아니에요
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	I just wanted cake.
		그냥 케이크를 먹고 싶어서
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	I eat garbage
		because I am garbage.
		전 쓰레기 먹을게요
		제가 쓰레기니까
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	(cellphone rings)
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	Hey, Dad. Hi.
		여보세요, 아빠
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	Um, listen.
		Can I call you back?
		저, 다시 전화드릴게요
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	JAY: Just wanted to confirm
		we're on for dinner at --
		저녁시간 확인하려고 전화했다
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	Oh, got another call.
		One sec.
		아, 전화 들어온다, 잠깐만
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	Yeah,
		I think she's onto us.
		네, 알아챈 것 같아요
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Yeah, a lot of mole talk.
		맞아요, 스파이 얘기 엄청 해요
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	I think we just need
		to calm things d--
		상황을 진정시켜야 할 것 같-
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	What?
		네?
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	You're talking to her
		right now?
		지금 통화중이시라구요?
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	Yeah, okay, bye.
		네, 알겠어요, 끊을게요
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	So, we're on for tonight?
		그래서, 오늘밤이지?
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	- Sure.
		- Great.
		- 네
		- 좋아
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	And, hey,
		you sound a little tense.
		너 좀 경직된 것 같다
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	Don't let the job
		make you crazy, huh?
		일 때문에 너무 신경쓰는 거 아니냐
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	You go that route, soon you're
		seeing plots everywhere.
		한번 빠져들면 계속 그쪽으로만 보여
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:18	Great tip, Dad.
		충고 감사해요, 아빠
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	Aah!
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:21	You're spying for my dad!
		너 아빠 스파이짓을 한 거야!
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	What? No!
		Yes. I'm sorry.
		네? 아니에요!
		맞아요, 죄송해요
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	I don't know why I agreed.
		왜 그러겠다 했는지 모르겠어요
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	I just look up to your dad
		so much.
		아버님을 너무 존경해선가
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	I can't believe
		he doesn't trust me.
		아빠가 날 못 믿다니 어이가 없어
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Why did he put me
		in charge, then?
		애초에 왜 나한테 맡기신 거야, 그럼?
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	I don't know,
		but I can find out.
		모르겠지만,
		밝혀낼 수 있어요
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	I'll double-agent.
		이중 스파이 할게요
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	I've been working this game
		since my parents' divorce.
		저희 부모님 이혼 때부터 해오던 일이에요
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	I was the only 10-year-old
		in Great Neck
		우리 동네에서 자는 시간 제한 없고
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	with no bedtime
		and Diners Club card.
		신용카드 있는 10살짜리는 저뿐이었어요
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	Fine. Don't make any plans
		for tonight.
		좋아, 오늘밤엔 계획 잡지마
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	- You're coming to dinner with me.
		- All right.
		- 나랑 저녁 자리에 가는 거야
		- 알겠어요
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	Um, can we stop by my house
		to change my shoes?
		저, 집에 들러서 
		신발 갈아신어도 될까요?
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	I didn't make it up here
		on the first try.
		한번에 못 올라왔거든요
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	(scoffs)
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:48	All right.
		The dove cannon is loaded,
		좋아
		비둘기 대포 준비됐고
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	the dancers are stretching,
		the dry ice is billowing.
		댄서들 몸풀고 있고
		드라이아이스도 나오고 있어
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	The moment you get her outside,
		I will cue the team.
		밖으로 데리고 나오는 순간
		신호 보낼게
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	Oh, there she is.
		헉, 저기 와요
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	Okay. Go.
		좋아, 가
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:57	All right, team.
		Look alive.
		자, 서둘러
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	We are hot.
		We are hot.
		진행중
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	- Melanie. Listen --
		- Manny.
		- 멜라니, 저기
		- 매니
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	Do you want to go
		to prom with me?
		나랑 같이 프롬 갈래?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	Uh, sure.
		어, 물론이지
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	(chuckles)
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	Oh, hey.
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	You got a second?
		시간 있어?
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	Yeah.
		응
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	Yeah, I'm second.
		You're first.
		그래, 난 2등이야
		넌 1등이고
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	I get it.
		You win everything.
		알았어
		네가 다 이겼어
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	That seems like something
		I'm gonna hear about later.
		뭔가 사연이 있는 것 같은데
		나중에 들을게
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	I need help
		with Luke's promposal, okay?
		루크 프롬포즈 좀 도와줘
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	Can you go to the gym, wait for
		Sarah, and then hand her this?
		체육관에서 사라 기다리다가 이것 좀 전해줘
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	- Okay, this is what
		I've been reduced to? - Yeah.
		내가 이렇게 몰락하는 거야?
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	Delivering an [sniffs] unperfumed
		envelope like a common bellhop?
		벨보이마냥 향기도 안나는 봉투 
		배달하는 신세라고?
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	- Fine.
		- Thank you. Okay.
		- 좋네
		- 고마워
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	Stand down, everybody.
		모두, 대기
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Little Bear's gone rogue.
		작은 곰이 불량스러워졌다
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	Wait.
		잠깐
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	Grayson! Hey.
		(laughs)
		그레이슨!
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	- Hey, Coach.
		- Hey.
		- 안녕하세요, 코치님
		- 안녕
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	Don't suppose you're planning
		on asking anyone to prom.
		너 프롬 신청 계획 없지
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	Um, I don't think we're allowed
		to go with teachers.
		저, 교사랑 같이 가는 건 안 되는데요
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	That's not what...
		그게 아니..
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	So, this is the house that
		stolen sauce built. (doorbell rings)
		훔친 소스로 이 집을 지었군요
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	I'm so angry that I don't even
		know what I'm gonna say to her!
		뭐라고 해야할지 모르겠다는 게 더 화나요!
00:13:49	 
		 
00:13:49	Ah, so, this is the house
		that the stolen sauce built!
		훔친 소스로 이 집을 지었구만!
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	Oh, I know what you're thinking,
		but this isn't my house.
		어떻게 생각할지 아는데,
		여긴 내 집이 아니야
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	I just come here
		to get my paycheck.
		월급받으러 온 거라네
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:59	Grandma,
		my shower's broken.
		할머니, 샤워기가 부서졌어요
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	I'm gonna use the one
		in the guesthouse.
		손님용 별채꺼 쓸게요
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	Whoa.
		와우
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Please be
		my new piano teacher.
		제발 새 피아노 선생님이길
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:05	(sighs) Fine.
		좋아
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	I'm Auntie Alice.
		내가 앨리스 이모야
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:09	Auntie Thief
		and Auntie Liar.
		도둑 이모에 거짓말쟁이 이모네
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:11	Yeah, yeah.
		그래, 그래
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	I'm sure we can
		work something out.
		해결방법이 있지
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	Who's your patent lawyer?
		특허 변호사가 누구요?
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	I don't have one.
		없어요
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	I know.
		알지
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	I patented your sauce
		this morning.
		오늘 아침 당신 소스를 특허냈거든
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Have a good trip home, kids.
		조심해서 집에 가렴, 얘들아
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:25	I am so sorry, Phil,
		that I wasted your whole day,
		정말 미안해요, 필
		나 때문에 하루를 낭비했네요
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	but I am more sorry of
		what I'm gonna do to your car!
		당신 차에 할 짓이 더 미안하지만!
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	Gloria, we're above that.
		글로리아, 똑같은 사람이 되진 맙시다
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	But not everyone would be.
		양심 없는 사람도 있지만요
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	You should put that beauty
		in your garage.
		저 차는 차고에 넣어둬요
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	- I don't have one.
		- Oh, really?
		- 그런 거 없어
		- 정말요?
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	Just out of curiosity,
		do you not have a garage
		그냥 궁금해서 그런데,
		차고가 없는 이유가
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	because you converted it
		into the guesthouse
		손님용 별채로 바꿔서 그런 겁니까?
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	where your grandson's
		currently showering?
		지금 손자분이 샤워하고 있는?
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	What's your game, mister?
		무슨 속셈이야?
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	I just find it interesting
		that you have
		흥미로워서 말입니다
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	a fully plumbed stand-alone
		dwelling on your property.
		소유지내 개별 배관시설을 갖춘 
		건축물이 있다는 것이요
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	That's none of your business.
		당신이 상관할 바 아니야
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:51	Even more peculiar, your
		grandson appears to live here,
		더욱 이상한 점은,
		손자분은 여기 사는 것 같은데
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	but judging by his T-shirt,
		he goes to Eden Mills High,
		입고 있는 티셔츠를 보면
		이든 밀스 고등학교에 다닌다는 거죠
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	an elite public school 12 miles
		outside of your district.
		여기 학군이랑 12마일 떨어진
		엘리트 공립학교 말이죠
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	Oh, maybe with the money
		you saved on private schools,
		아, 어쩌면 사립학교에 쓸 돈을 아껴서
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:02	you paid for the new two-sided
		brick fireplace I saw,
		양면 벽돌 벽난로를 설치하셨나보죠
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	which hasn't been legal
		since 1988.
		1988년 이후로 불법인데도
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Go, Phil, go!
		필 화이팅!
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	Pull the sauce, Big Al,
		소스는 포기하시지, 앨씨
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	or Monday morning, the city's
		here with a bulldozer,
		안 그럼 월요일 아침에
		시에선 불도저를 끌고 오고
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	and your grandson goes to
		a school with a metal detector.
		손자는 금속탐지기 있는 
		학교에 다니게 될거야
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	How do you know all this?
		그걸 어떻게 다 아는 거야?
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	What are you -- some kind
		of real-estate agent?
		당신 뭐 부동산 중개인이라도 돼?
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	No.
		He's a Realtor.
		아니
		부동산 중개업자시지
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	There is a difference somehow!
		뭔진 모르겠지만 다르다고!
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:26	(doors open)
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	Oh, hey, kids.
		아, 얘들아
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	Actually,
		I'm waiting for Sarah,
		내가 사라를 기다리고 있는데
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	so if I could have the room
		for just a -- a minute.
		잠깐만 자리 좀 내주면 안될까
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	Thank --
		Okay, funny.
		고맙-
		그래, 재밌네
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	Whoever turned out the lights,
		please turn them back on.
		거기 불 끈 사람, 다시 켜줄래
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	They're not working.
		Might be a fuse.
		안 켜져요
		퓨즈 나갔나봐요
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	(cellphone rings)
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	Oh, um...
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	Mitchell,
		we have a problem.
		밋첼, 문제가 생겼어
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	MITCHELL:
		No, we don't.
		아냐
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	I mean,
		unless you're busy that night.
		그날밤 안 바쁘면 말야
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	Are -- Are you
		asking me to prom?
		나한테 프롬 신청 하는 거야?
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	Well, you know,
		they need chaperones.
		그야, 뭐, 보호자 필요하다니까
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	Mitchell, this is the sweetest thing
		you've ever done for me.
		밋첼, 자기가 한 것 중에 제일 다정한 일이야
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	I-I don't know
		if I've mentioned it,
		내가 말했는지 모르겠는데
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	but I never got
		to go to my own prom.
		나 내 프롬에 못 갔거든
00:15:59	 
		 
00:15:59	It's come up.
		얘기했었어요
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:01	What about
		Luke's promposal?
		루크 프롬포즈는 어떡하고?
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	Well, your husband, who
		couldn't plan anything romantic
		목에 칼이 들어와도
		로맨틱이랑은 거리가 먼
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	with a gun to his head,
		당신의 남편께서 말야
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	may have pulled off
		two promposals at once.
		한번에 두 개의 프롬포즈를 해내셨지
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	- Mm-hmm.
		- Hey.
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	Do you have any idea
		who put that note in my locker
		내 사물함에 이거 같이 하자는 쪽지
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	asking me to be
		a part of this thing?
		누가 넣은 건지 혹시 알아?
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	Oh, yeah,
		it was my uncle.
		응, 내 삼촌이었어
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	It's pretty clever
		how he turned out the lights.
		불 끈게 영리했지
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	I said,
		"Turned out the lights"!
		"불 끄라고" 했잖아!
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:25	Oh, my God!
		Yes!
		세상에!
		좋아!
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Oh! That's so sweet.
		I...
		아, 너무 귀엽다
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	And I can't believe
		I'm finally going to prom.
		내가 프롬에 가게 되다니 
		믿을 수가 없어
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	I can't believe
		I finally have a happy memory
		내가 학교 체육관에서 
		좋은 기억을 갖게 되다니
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	- in a high-school gym.
		- (laughs)
		믿을 수가 없네
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:36	- CLAIRE: Joe did that to you?
		- JAY: Yeah.
		- 조가 그랬다구요?
		- 그래
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	- Slammed a car hood on it.
		- Why?
		- 본네트로 찍었다니까
		- 왜요?
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	I owed him money.
		돈 안 갚아서
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	It slipped while I was
		teaching him to check oil.
		오일 체크하는 거 가르쳐주다가 미끌어졌어
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:43	Well, that's pretty advanced
		for a 3-year-old.
		3살한테 너무 어려운 거 아녜요
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	What can I say?
		I believe in my kids.
		어쩌겠니?
		내 자식들을 믿는걸
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	- Thank you. Mmm.
		- Mm.
		고맙습니다
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	- Looks good. Thank you.
		- Mm-hmm.
		맛있어 보이네요
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	Very nice.
		아주 좋아
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	Let's quickly go over the plan.
		계획 다시 정리해보자
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	- My dad's gonna be here
		any minute. - Mm-hmm.
		아빠가 곧 여기 오실거야
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	We're doing this
		in stages.
		단계별로 하는데
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	One finger
		means you text him
		손가락 하나 하면 문자하는 거야
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	"We're closing
		the blinds division."
		"블라인드쪽 철수한답니다"
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	Our biggest earner?
		제일 큰 소득원을요?
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	He's gonna lose it if I tell
		him we're shuttering blinds.
		블라인드 닫는 거 알면
		엄청 화내실 거예요
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	Two fingers, we're partnering
		with Rod Bushmill.
		손가락 두개는
		로드 부쉬밀이랑 제휴하는 거야
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	That sleazebag represents
		everything your father
		아버님께선 경력 내내 
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	spent an entire career
		fighting against.
		그런 부조리와 싸워오셨는데요
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	- Three fingers, we're not
		going to ClosetCon. - Wha--
		세개면, 벽장컨벤션에 안 가는 거야
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	Are you trying to teach your father
		a lesson or crush his soul?
		아버님께 교훈을 드리려는 거예요
		영혼을 파괴하려는 거예요?
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	Just business, kid.
		그냥 비지니스야, 꼬마야
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:23	Monster.
		괴물..
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	- Looks good. Thank you.
		- Mm-hmm.
		맛있어 보이네요
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:27	(cellphone vibrates)
		(sighs)
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	So... with all this prom stuff
		coming up,
		프롬 시즌인데
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	is your house
		as topsy-turvy as ours is?
		아빠네도 뒤죽박죽이에요?
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	Not really.
		Manny's taking this girl.
		별로
		매니가 여자앨 데려가는데
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	She's nothing special,
		but solid.
		특별하진 않지만, 착실하지
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	- Mm.
		- Reliable.
		믿을만하고
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	A lot like our blinds division.
		우리 블라인드 라인처럼
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	You know --
		not sexy, but --
		섹시하진 않지만-
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	No, Dad.
		No shop talk.
		아뇨, 아빠
		회사이야기는 그만
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	You've had enough of that
		for a lifetime.
		그건 평생 해왔잖아요
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:47	(cellphone vibrates) Wow, your phone
		is really blowing up tonight.
		아빠 폰 오늘 엄청 바쁘네요
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	Mm.
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	Two old-fashioneds.
		올드 패션드 두잔입니다
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	- Thank you.
		- Oh, thank you.
		- 고맙소
		- 고마워요
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	Okay. Here.
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	You know what else seems
		old-fashioned to me nowadays?
		요즘엔 뭐가 구식이 된지 아니?
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:57	- Mm?
		- Integrity.
		- 네?
		- 진실성이야
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Maybe because
		I spent my career
		내가 이 업계에서 있는 내내
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	fighting the sleazeballs
		in our industry.
		추잡한 놈들이랑 맞섰거든
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	You know --
		the Rod Bushmill types.
		그 왜, 로드 부쉬밀 같은 놈들
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	Rod's a sweetheart.
		로드씨 완전 착해요
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	He bought me lunch
		last week.
		지난주에 점심도 얻어먹었어요
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	We got to talking
		about whether or not we --
		얘기했는데 잘하면 우리-
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	(scoffs)
		What am I doing?
		내가 뭐하는 거람?
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	- Jibber-jabbering about work.
		- Mm.
		쓸데없는 일 얘기나 하네요
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	So, that little
		grease monkey Joe is 3.
		그래서, 우리 정비사 조가 
		세 살이란 말이죠
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	Hard to believe.
		3.
		믿기 어려워요 세 살이라니
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	They grow up so fast.
		(cellphone vibrates)
		너무 빨리 크는 거 같아
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:23	Got to be nice, though, Dad,
		근데 괜찮을 거예요
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	knowing that your company
		is in good hands
		회사는 믿을 만한 사람한테 맡기고
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	and you can stay home all day long
		and just play with your kid.
		집에 있으면서 애랑 놀아주는 것도
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	- Have you lost your mind?
		- Well, not @@/all@@\ day, obviously.
		- 너 정신 나갔냐?
		- 뭐, 하루종일은 아니구요
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	3-year-olds are nothing
		but bipolar germ buckets.
		3살꼬맹이는 세균투성이거든요
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	You're skipping out
		on ClosetCon?
		벽장컨벤션에 안 간다고?
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	- Who told you that?
		- Ben.
		- 누가 그래요?
		- 벤
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	That little weasel
		told me everything.
		그 족제비같은 놈이
		다 일러바치거든
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	Listen, I can tolerate
		shutting down the blinds,
		블라인드 철수는 참을 수 있어
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	even Rod Bushmill, but not
		showing up for ClosetCon,
		로드 부쉬밀까지도 참아
		하지만 벽장컨벤션에 안 간다고?
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	you're asking
		not to be taken seriously.
		그게 별 게 아니라는 거냐?
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	My God, Claire!
		맙소사, 클레어!
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	We're one strong season
		away from being invited
		국제 벽장 엑스포 초대 받기
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	to Expo Internationale
		Du Closets!
		바로 직전인데!
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	(sighs)
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	Why are you looking at me
		like that?
		왜 그렇게 보냐?
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:55	'Cause I'm not doing
		any of those things.
		그거 다 안 할 거거든요
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	I told that little weasel Ben
		to text you those things
		내가 벤족제비한테 
		그렇게 보내라고 시켰어요
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	when I found out
		that he was spying for you.
		아빠 스파이란 거 알았거든요
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	And, by the way,
		it doesn't feel very nice
		그건 그렇고, 참 기분 좋네요
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	to know that you don't think
		that I can run your company.
		내가 운영 못 할거라고 생각해주시다니
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	That's not why I did it.
		그래서 그런 것 아니다
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:09	I thought maybe you could
		use a little support.
		조금 도움이 될까 싶어서 그런거지
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:11	You're staring down the barrel
		of your first ClosetCon.
		첫 컨벤션 앞두고 무리하고 있잖아
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	So you spied on me?
		그래서 스파이를 보냈다구요?
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	I mean, you could have
		given me a call.
		전화 한통 줬으면 되잖아요
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	And tell you that you're
		not doing your job?
		전화해서 너 일 못한다고 하라고?
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	That would have
		gone over fine with you.
		어지간히 좋아했겠다
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:24	Need any help?
		도와드릴까요?
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	- No!
		- No.
		- 아뇨!
		- 아뇨
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:28	I mean, look at us.
		이거 보라구
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	Why can't we both admit
		우리 둘 다 인정을 못해
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:31	that we could use
		each other's help right now?
		서로를 도울 수 있단 사실을 말야
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:33	Are we too proud
		to even do that?
		고작 자존심때문에
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	I'll admit it if you will.
		아빠가 인정하면 저도 할게요
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	Fine.
		좋아
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	On 3.
		셋 센다
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	1... 2... 3.
		1... 2... 3
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	- Will you crack my lobster?
		- I want to come back to work.
		- 제 랍스터 좀 깨주세요
		- 다시 일하고 싶다
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	- What?!
		- Damn it!
		- 뭐라고요?!
		- 젠장!
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	Oh, my God.
		You want to come back to work?
		맙소사, 돌아오고 싶으신 거예요?
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	I miss it, okay?
		일이 그리워, 됐어?
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	You know how it is when you
		have closets in your blood.
		핏속에 벽장이 흐르는 기분 알잖아
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	I'm going crazy
		in retirement.
		은퇴하니 미쳐버리겠다
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:51	Why are you smiling at me
		like that?
		왜 그렇게 웃는 거냐?
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	Because we're so similar.
		우리가 너무 닮아서요
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	Do you know how many times
		I've wanted to call you
		몇 번이나 아빠한테 전화해서
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	to ask
		for your help or advice,
		도와달라고 하고 싶었는지 아세요?
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	but I was afraid
		I would look weak?
		하지만 약해보이는게 싫어서
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	(sighs)
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	Here.
		You crack this.
		여기
		아빠가 깨주세요
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	Give me that.
		I'll open these things.
		이리내, 내가 할게
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	Well, Dad, what do you think
		about coming back to work --
		아빠, 회사로 돌아오시는 거 어때요
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	I don't know --
		one or two days a week?
		일주일에 하루 이틀 정도?
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:11	- What I was thinking was, I'd have
		a staff of five. - Mm-hmm.
		생각해봤는데 직원 다섯명이랑
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	- My own building.
		- What?
		- 독채에
		- 네?
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	And I report to no one.
		아무한테도 보고 안하는 거야
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	(chuckles)
		I'm kidding.
		농담이지
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	I'll put a desk
		in the copy room.
		복사실에 책상둬도 돼
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	And, by the way, I've
		known you for a long time.
		그건 그렇고, 
		내가 널 오래 봤는데 말이다
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	The last thing you need to
		worry about is looking weak.
