00:00:06	The attack took place in the
		middle of a shift change.
		사건이 일어난건 교대 시간입니다.
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:09	Normally the shift
		works till morning,
		야간교대는 아침까지 당직을 서지만
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	but some of the crew had a
		bachelor party tonight.
		몇몇 사람들은 총각 파티에 가 있었답니다.
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:14	Who's getting married?
		누가 결혼했지?
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:17	Toby Rawlins.
		토비 롤린스입니다. 
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	He found the victim seconds
		after his throat was cut.
		피해자가 공격당한 직후 발견했습니다.
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	Mm. That's gotta be the
		worst bachelor party ever.
		사상 최악의 총각 파티가 됐겠군. 
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:24	Did Toby see what happened?
		토비가 본 건 없고?
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	He saw a hooded man
		run into the woods.
		후드 쓴 남자가 숲속으로 도주하는 걸 봤답니다.
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Jeans, dark jacket.
		Couldn't make out a face.
		청바지에 어두운 자켓. 얼굴은 보지 못했답니다.
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	Any sign of a murder weapon?
		흉기는 발견됐어?
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	Nothing.
		아니요.
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	Who's the victim?
		피해자 이름은?
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:36	Paul Satterfield.
		폴 세터필드. 
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	25 years on the job.
		25년된 소방수입니다. 
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	- Excuse me.
		- Multiple citations for bravery.
		- 잠깐만.
		- 표창장도 여러번 받았습니다. 
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:48	It's not your fault.
		선생님 잘못 아닙니다.
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:50	Yeah, I know that.
		저도 압니다.
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:52	Unless, of course, you did it.
		물론 아니겠지만, 선생님이 범인만 아니라면요.
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	- Did you kill him?
		- No!
		- 죽였습니까?
		- 아니요!
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	Okay. Just had to ask.
		한번 물어보고 넘어가야 해서요.
00:00:58	 
		 
00:01:00	What are you doing
		out here, anyway?
		그나저나 밤중엔 뭣하러 나왔습니까?
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:02	Thought you were headed off
		싱글로서의 마지막 날을 축하하며 
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:03	to celebrate your
		last day of freedom.
		흥청망청했어야 하는거 아닌가요.
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:05	Paul couldn't make the party.
		폴이 제때 오지 못했습니다. 
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:07	He never leaves his shift early.
		무슨 일이 있어도 당직은 지켰으니까요.
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:09	But he bought me a cigar
		for us to smoke together.
		하지만 함께 피우자고 시가를 사줬어요.
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:12	So someone inside
		the fire station
		그러니까 소방서의 누군가는
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	knew the victim was
		coming out here?
		피해자가 이리로 오리란걸 알았다구요?
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	If you're saying one of our
		guys did this, no way.
		우리 동료들 중 하나를 지목하는 거라면 말도 안됩니다. 
00:01:18	 
		 
00:01:18	I saw the killer get
		away through there.
		범인은 저쪽으로 달아났습니다. 
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:21	Look, we had half
		the fire station
		소방서의 절반은 
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	looking for him.
		놈을 찾고 있습니다. 
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	Guys from two shifts.
		2개 교대조 인원이요.
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:25	Could be the killer
		circled back around
		어쩌면 살인자가 되돌아와 
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	and joined the
		search for himself.
		슬그머니 수색조에 끼어들었을 수 있지. 
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:29	Could have happened.
		It would have been chaotic out here.
		가능해. 현장은 혼란스러웠으니까. 
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	Paul Satterfield was one of us.
		폴 세터필드는 우리 동료였어요.
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:35	We all loved him like a brother.
		우리 모두 그를 형제처럼 사랑했단 말입니다.
00:01:36	 
		 
00:01:36	Yeah. You've heard of
		Cain and Abel, right?
		카인이 아벨한테 한 짓은 알죠?
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:39	Cho, gather the firefighters.
		We need to establish a timeline.
		조, 소방수들 불러모아. 시간대 구성 좀 해야겠어.
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:43	Can I borrow your flashlight?
		손전등 좀 빌리자.
00:01:44	 
		 
00:01:44	I'm gonna go looking
		for the murder weapon.
		흉기를 찾아봐야겠어. 
00:01:46	 
		 
00:02:23	Aah!
		 
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	Aah!
		 
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:48	Jane?
		제인?
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:51	Jane, you out here?
		제인, 여기 있어?
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:54	Jane, come on!
		이제 나와봐!
00:02:55	 
		 
00:03:03	No.
		안돼.
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:09	No.
		안돼.
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:11	Paramedics!
		구급대원!
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	I need help now! Please!
		여기 도와주세요! 
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	Jane... Jane, come on.
		제인, 제발...

00:03:27	Still not breathing. No pulse.
		호흡과 맥박 없음. 
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	Is he prone to
		seizures or blackouts?
		평소 자주 발작하거나 기절하는 편입니까?
00:03:30	 
		 
00:03:30	No.
		아니요.
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:37	How long has he been out here?

00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	I don't know.
		Um, seven, eight minutes, maybe.
		모르겠어요. 7, 8분 정도인가. 아마도.
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:42	Defibulator. Stand back.

00:03:48

00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:52	Empty bag.
		공기주머니. 
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:53	Come on, start bagging.
		계속 호흡 확보해봐. 
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:59	Everybody clear.
		모두 물러나.
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:07	Still nothing.
		맥박 아직 없음. 
00:04:08

00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:14	Got a sinus rythm.
		박동이 정상으로 돌아왔습니다. 
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:16	Jane... Jane, are you okay?
		제인, 제인.. 괜찮아?
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:18	Bring that O2 up.
		산소 공급해. 
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:20	Can you hear me? Jane?
		내 말 들려, 제인?
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:28	On my count.
		셋을 세면 들어올린다.
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	One, two, three, lift.
		하나, 둘, 셋. 
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:32	Coming through.
		지나갑니다. 
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	Hey, watch yourselves.
		조심하세요.
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	Make a hole, make a hole.
		Coming through.
		비켜주세요. 지나갑니다.
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:38	how is he?
		제인은요?
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	He's breathing.
		숨을 쉬었어.
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	He's gonna be fine.
		He'll be fine.
		괜찮아질거야. 꼭 그럴거야.
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:53	Jane?
		제인?
00:04:54	 
		 
00:05:00	How you feeling?
		기분은 어때?
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:03	Excellent, I think.
		최고인 것 같아.
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:07	It's good to see you breathing.
		다시 숨쉬는 걸 보니 정말 다행이야.
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:09	It's good to see you, period.
		나도 다시 만나 반가워, 이상. 
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:12	We're doing everything we
		can to find your attacker.
		너 공격한 놈 반드시 찾을게. 
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	You didn't happen to
		see a face, did you?
		얼굴은 못 봤지?
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	No.
		못 봤어.
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:20	Not that I can remember.
		기억하는 것 같지 않아. 
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	What's the last thing
		you do remember?
		마지막으로 기억나는게 뭐야?
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:32	Are we sleeping together?
		저기, 우리가 같이 자는 사인가?
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:35	Excuse me?
		뭐라고?
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	Well, you're a cop,
		that's obvious,
		아니 그쪽은 경찰이고. 그건 확실한데. 
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	but you're not treating
		me like a suspect.
		날 용의자 다루듯 안하니까. 
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	And I can't see any other
		reason for a police officer
		그리고 아무리 생각해도 경찰이 이러고 
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	to come to my bedside
		unless we're--
		내 베갯머리를 찾아올 이유가 없으니 결국엔.. 
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	unless we're sleeping together.
		결국엔 우리가 그거 아니겠냐는 거지. 
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:49	You don't know who I am?
		너 나 누군지 모르는구나?
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	Please don't take it personally.
		I'm sure you're quite memorable.
		그렇다고 개인적으로 받아들이진 말고. 
		기억에 남을만한 미인이시니까.
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	I just--I-I've been
		through a lot...
		내가 좀 여자관계가... 
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	apparently.
		보면 아시겠지만서도.
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:58	No.
		아니.
00:05:59	 
		 
00:06:00	We are not sleeping together.
		우리 자는 사이 아니야.
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	We're working toward
		it, though, right?
		그럼 같이 일하는 사이구나.
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	So I haven't missed anything?
		그럼 내가 또 까먹은건 없는거지?
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:07	What's your name?
		이름이?
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:11	Are you putting me on?
		지금 나 놀리는거지?
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:14	I wish I was.
		진짜 그럼 나도 좋겠어.
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:16	Um, I'm Teresa
		Lisbon with the CBI.
		난 CBI의 테레사 리스본이라고 하고... 
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	I'm a homicide detective.
		강력계 형사야.
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:23	You're my consultant.
		너는 내 수사자문이고.
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	I catch bad guys?
		Wow, that sounds like fun.
		내가 악당을 잡는다고? 그거 재밌겠는데.
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	I always wanted to pit
		my psychic skills
		난 언제나 내 영적인 능력을 
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	against criminals.
		범죄와 싸우는데 쓰고 싶었지. 
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	You're not a psychic.
		너 영매 아닌데. 
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	You used to pretend
		to be one, but you--
		한때 그렇다고 사기를 쳤지만 결국.. 
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	But what?
		결국 뭐?
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:37	Teresa?
		테레사?
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:39	Uh, I'm sorry.
		I should have talked to the doctor
		미안해. 여기 들어오기 전에 
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:43	before I came in here. I--
		의사랑 먼저 얘기를 했어야 했는데. 
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	Whoa, whoa. Teresa, wait.
		저기, 저기, 테레사. 잠깐만. 
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:47	I saw something
		during my attack.
		공격당하면서 내가 뭔가 봤어.
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:50	What did you see?
		뭘?
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	A light.
		빛.
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:54	What kind of light?
		무슨 빛?
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:56	White light. Intensely bright.
		강렬하고 하얀 빛. 
00:06:59	 
		 
00:07:00	And I walked toward it.
		내가 그쪽으로 걸어갔는데 
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:02	There were people, lots of
		people gathered around,
		사람이 무지 많이 모여 있었어.
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	reaching out with
		their hands to me.
		내 쪽으로 손을 내밀고 있었지.
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	There was a woman--
		a woman who knew you.
		거기 한 여성분이 널 알고 있었어.
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:12	Your mother.
		너희 어머니.
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	Jane, I'm not impressed.
		재미없다.
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	I told you my mother
		died when I was a girl.
		우리 엄마 죽었다곤 애저녁에 말해줬거든.
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:19	Well, did you tell me that
		she gave you that cross?
		그 십자가를 주셨다고도 말했나?
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:23	You touched it just like
		that when I was unconscious.
		내가 정신을 잃었을 때도 꼭 그렇게 어루만졌지.
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:28	It's what... led her to me.
		그래서 어머니께 인도된거야.
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:32	And now I can lead her to you.
		이제는 내가 널 인도해줄게. 
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:35	You wanna put me in touch
		with my dead mother?
		우리 돌아가신 엄마랑 연결해 주겠다는거지. 
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	I'm a psychic, Teresa.
		That's what I do.
		난 영매야, 테레사. 그게 내 일이지. 
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:42	He doesn't know who I am.
		제가 누군지 모르고 있습니다. 
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	He doesn't know who
		he is, either.
		뿐만 아니라 본인이 누군지도 모릅니다.
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	It's called dissociative fugue--
		해리성 기억장애입니다.
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	the temporary loss of
		personal identity.
		일시적으로 본인 정체성을 잊은거죠.
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	It can last hours or months,
		and in rare cases, years.
		수시간이나 수달만에 돌아오나, 드물게는 수년도 갑니다.
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	But he remembers some things,
		어떤 건 기억하고 있었어요.
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	like he used to be
		a fake psychic.
		꼭 가짜 영매 행세를 할 때처럼.
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	He just did a cold
		reading on me--
		저한테 콜드리딩을 했는데 
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	it was a good one.
		썩 괜찮았거든요.
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	Has he had any previous traumas?
		환자에게 과거 트라우마 같은 것이 있습니까?
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	His wife and daughter
		were murdered.
		아내와 딸이 살해당했어요.
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	There you go. His subconscious
		mind is protecting itself
		그겁니다. 환자의 무의식이 고통을 억압해 
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	from further trauma by
		blocking out that pain.
		트라우마로부터 마음을 지키려 하는거죠.
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	As far as Patrick knows,
		his family never existed.
		지금 패트릭은 가족을 가져본 적도 없는 겁니다.
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	Their death is what
		brought him to us.
		그 가족이 죽었기 때문에 저희랑 일하는 건데요.
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	And that's why he
		doesn't know you.
		그러니 형사님을 기억 못할 밖에요.
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	But it sounds like you're
		just what he needs
		하지만 그렇기 때문에 
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	to get back on his feet.
		스스로 기억을 찾는데 형사님 도움이 필요할 것 같군요.
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:20	How should we act
		when he gets here?
		제인이 오면 어떻게 해야 합니까?
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	Normal.
		평범하게.
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	I never know how to act
		around Jane normally.
		제인씨 옆에서는 평범해질수가 없는데요.
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	Then you're all set.
		그럼 넌 연기라도 해. 
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	But don't talk about his past.
		The doctor said it's important
		하지만 과거는 불문에 붙여. 
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	that Jane's memories
		come back on their own.
		의사 말이 기억은 스스로 찾게 해야 한대. 
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	This is crazy.
		He should still be in the hospital.
		미친 짓이에요. 병원에 있는게 마땅하다구요.
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	On the contrary,
		오히려 
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	the doctor wants him in
		a familiar environment.
		의사는 익숙한 환경이 도움이 될 거래. 
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:36	Is he gonna help with the case?
		수사에 도움이나 되겠어요?
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	He says he can't wait.
		함께하고 싶어 안달이 났던데. 
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:40	You sure this is a
		good idea, boss?
		이게 정말 잘하는 짓일까요?
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	I don't know, but Jane needs
		something to hold on to,
		모르겠지만 제인도 붙잡을게 있어야지. 
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	and we're gonna give it to him.
		그걸 우리가 줘야 하고. 
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:46	Where are we with the victim?
		그래서 피해자에 대해 밝혀진건?
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	Well, according to
		his come on-workers,
		동료들에 따르면
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	Paul Satterfield was a
		legend at the firehouse.
		소방서에선 전설적인 인물이었답니다. 
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	The old guard respected him,
		the younger guys idolized him.
		고참들은 존경하고 신입들은 숭배하는 지경이더군요.
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Satterfield left
		behind a widow, Diane.
		다이안이라고 부인이 있습니다.
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	They were together for 16 years.
		결혼한지는 16년이랍니다. 
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	She's coming by this
		morning to talk.
		오늘 오전에 인터뷰할 겁니다. 
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	Anything from the crime scene?
		현장에서의 특이점은?
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	No trace evidence. All the
		EMTs and firefighters
		증거가 없습니다. 모든 구급대원과 소방수가 
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	trying to rescue him, they
		contaminated everything.
		피해자를 구하려 했기 때문에 현장이 오염됐습니다.
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:05	Okay, I vote we skip the
		awkward introductions
		어색하게 자기소개 이런건 건너뛰자구.
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	because you all know me, and
		in one sweeping glance,
		여러분이야 날 알테고 난 한번만 쓱 보면 
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	I know as much about each of
		you as the day I forgot you.
		여러분 하나하나가 손금 보듯 들여다 보이니까.
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	You gave us a scare yesterday.
		어젠 진짜 걱정했어요.
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	Well, not my intention,
		I assure you.
		이런, 걱정시킬 생각은 없었는데. 
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:18	Well, we're just glad
		you pulled through.
		물에서 꺼내서 다행이었죠.
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:22	Thanks, Bigsby.
		고마워, 빅스비. 
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:25	Rigsby. It's Wayne Rigsby.
		릭스비. 웨인 릭스비라구요.
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:28	Wayne.
		웨인.
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:29	We're just working the case, so
		feel free to jump in anytime.
		사건 얘기 중이었는데 언제든지 참여해도 좋아. 
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	Okay. Your armed robber--
		아, 좋아. 무장강도 사건. 
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	desperate amateur.
		Why work alone?
		완전히 아마추어였군. 왜 단독으로 저질렀지?
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	Because he doesn't know
		any other criminals.
		아는 다른 범죄자가 없으니까. 
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:40	The lucha libre mask projects
		the correct attitude,
		프로 레슬러 마스크는 제대론데 
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	but look-- look what
		he is wearing--
		하지만 입은거 좀 봐.
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	khakis and a fitted sweater.
		카키색 면바지에 붙는 스웨터야.
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	Jane-- no wonder the guard
		tried to shoot him.
		- 제인. - 이러니 경비가 쏴죽이려 하지. 
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	The closest a man
		should ever come
		여자 꼬실때나 아니면 
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	to touching a fitted sweater
		is helping a woman out of one.
		여간해선 저런 붙는거 안 입잖아. 
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	Jane, another team is handling
		the ATM lobby hit.
		제인, 인출기 강도 사건은 다른 팀 거고
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	We got the dead fireman.
		우린 소방수 사건이야.
00:09:59	 
		 
00:10:01	Got it.
		그렇구만. 
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:03	The victim was featured
		in a local newscast
		피해자는 살해당한 날 
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	the day of his murder.
		지역방송을 탔습니다. 
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:07	I pulled a copy
		of the broadcast.
		방송국에서 복사본을 받아왔습니다. 
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	We might find something
		useful in it.
		쓸만한게 있을 겁니다. 
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	Dramatic rescue before the
		light of dawn this morning.
		새벽 여명이 걷히기도 전의 영웅적인 뉴스입니다.
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	Firefighter Paul Satterfield
		risked it all
		소방수 폴 세터필드가 윌든의 한 불타는 주택에서 
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	to pull an unconscious man
		from his burning house in Wilden.
		실신한 남자를 들쳐업고 나왔습니다. 
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:20	Both men barely escaped
		with their lives
		두사람이 탈출하고 간발의 차이로 
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	when a dramatic ***
		exploded behind them.
		엄청난 폭발이 현장을 휩쓸었습니다.
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	Officials believe
		소방서 발표에 따르면 
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	the fire spread from the chimney
		of the two-story home of town
		불길은 2층집의 굴뚝에서 시작됐으며
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	Wilcox, who was treated for
		smoke inhalation
		연기 흡입으로 병원으로 이송된 
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	and released from
		the hospital.
		윌콕스씨의 집이라고 합니다. 
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	This isn't the first time we've
		featured Paul Satterfield
		폴 세터필드의 활약은
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	on this newscast.
		이뿐만이 아니었습니다.
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	Where's Satterfield's partner?
		세터필드의 파트너는 어딨죠?
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	You always enter a burning
		structure with two firefighters.
		화재현장에는 언제나 소방관 2인 1조예요.
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	I wanna know who led the victim
		into that death trap alone.
		피해자를 혼자 가게 내버려둔게 누군지 알아야겠어요.
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	Go to the firehouse and find out.
		Take Jane.
		소방서에 가봐. 제인 데리고.
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	Me?
		나?
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Whoever killed Satterfield
		tried to kill you.
		세터필드 살해범이 누구든 너 역시 죽이려 했어. 
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	Oh, you wanna give him
		another try at that?
		그래서 두번째 기회라도 주게?
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	You'll be okay.
		Rigsby will be with you.
		릭스비가 같이 가니 괜찮아. 
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	Why is Teresa insisting that
		I meet these firefighters?
		테레사는 왜 나더러 소방관을 만나라 성화야?
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	Well, you might
		recognize the killer.
		범인을 알아볼지 모르잖아요.
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Well, it's doubtful.
		아닐걸. 
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	They said that I was
		attacked in the dark
		사람들 말이 당시는 밤이었고 
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	and held underwater.
		난 물속에 처박혔다구.
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:05	So isn't it likely that
		he took me from behind?
		그리고 보나마나 내 뒤에서 덮치지 않았겠어?
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:07	Yeah, probably.
		아마도요.
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	But you're still good at
		sussing out guilty parties.
		하지만 범죄자들 마음 읽어내는덴 선수잖아요.
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	Huh. How do I do that exactly?
		내가 그런걸 어떻게 했는데?
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	Uh, it's hard to say.
		Causing trouble, mostly.
		설명하긴 어려운데, 괜히 진상을 부린다고 해야 하나.
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:17	And you don't mind?
		그걸 내비둬?
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	No, we're a team.
		We help each other out.
		같은 팀이니까 서로 도와야죠.
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:21	Oh.
		아항. 
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	Well, in that case, Wayne,
		그래서 말인데, 웨인. 
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	what's the best way in
		with the luscious redhead?
		그 화끈한 빨강머리 공략법이 뭐야?
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:27	Van Pelt?
		반펠트요?
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	Well, clearly you two had a
		thing, and she dumped you,
		아니, 너희 둘이 사귄건 딱보면 나오는데 넌 차였겠고.
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	but maybe you can share a tip
		on how to open the cookie jar,
		하지만 빨강머리 무장 해제의 팁 정돈 알거 아냐.
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	you know? Get some, uh...
		뭔 말인지 알지?
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:36	tasty gingersnaps?
		빨강머리 길들이기. 
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:38	Oh. You want a tip?
		팁을 공유하자?
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:41	Back off.
		꺼져요.
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:47	I thought we were a team.
		아깐 뭐 팀이라며.
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:51	I'm sorry for your loss,
		Mrs. Satterfield.
		부군 일은 유감입니다.
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	You are, are you?
		아, 그러세요?
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	Yes, ma'am.
		그렇습니다.
00:11:56	 
		 
00:11:56	I hold firefighters in
		the highest regard.
		항상 소방관을 존경해 왔습니다.
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	Even ones who die
		in a knife fight?
		칼부림하다 뒈진 것까지?
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:01	Hell, even I didn't
		see that one coming.
		나도 이런 건 상상도 못했어. 
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	Oh. You mind?
		담배 피워도 돼요?
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:07	It's not allowed.
		금연입니다. 
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:13	Did your husband
		have any enemies?
		남편분께 적이 있었습니까?
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:16	God, no.
		Paul Satterfield was a hero.
		전혀요. 폴 세터필드는 영웅이었는걸. 
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:19	You didn't hear?
		첨 들어요?
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:21	You will.
		곧 듣게 될 거예요.
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:24	Where's your wedding ring?
		결혼반지는 어떡하셨죠?
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:27	Oh, I'm having it
		melted for cash.
		엿바꿔 먹었어요.
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:31	No, not really.
		At least not for cash anyway.
		농담이고. 돈 때문만은 아니라 
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:35	Having it resized to
		fit my middle finger.
		중지에 맞춰 늘리려구요.
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:38	Think of it as a statement.
		돌싱선언을 해야지. 
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:40	Clearly you don't mind being
		considered a murder suspect.
		용의자 취급을 받아도 상관 없으시단 거군요.
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	Consider me whatever you want.
		좋을대로 생각해요.
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	You know?
		그거 알아요?
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:46	You're wasting your time.
		지금 시간 낭비하는거야.
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:48	I was working last night.
		난 어제 근무조였거든.
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	Yeah? Where?
		그러세요? 어디서요?
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Suicide prevention hotline.
		자살방지 핫라인.
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:56	It's true.
		진짜라니까.
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:58	Two minutes with me,
		나랑 2분만 얘기하면 
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	and your life ain't
		looking so bad.
		당신 인생도 좀 괜찮아 보일걸요.
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:01	You sure I can't have a smoke?
		진짜 담배 피우면 안돼요?
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:08	Gather around, please.
		These men are with CBI.
		모두 모여라. CBI에서 나오셨다. 
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:12	We're gonna do everything we
		can to help them out for Paul.
		폴을 위해 최대한 협조해 드리도록 한다. 
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	Thank you, captain.
		감사합니다, 대장님. 
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	My name is agent Rigsby.
		This is Patrick Jane.
		전 릭스비 요원이고 이쪽은 패트릭 제인씨입니다.
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:20	I know that some of you out
		here today are on your day off,
		이중 몇몇 분은 비번으로 아는데 
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	and I wanna thank you all
		for being here today.
		그럼에도 불구하고 와주셔서 감사합니다. 
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	I spent a lot of
		time working arson,
		전 방화사건을 많이 다뤄봐서 
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	which is why I know
		that Paul Satterfield
		어제 화재현장에서 
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	was hung out to dry yesterday
		during that house fire.
		누군가 일부러 폴 세터필드를 곤경에 빠뜨렸다는 걸 알고 있습니다.
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:31	What are you suggesting?
		무슨 말을 하고 싶은거요?
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	Doesn't matter.
		I got what I need.
		상관없어. 난 다 알아냈으니까. 
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	You recognize one of these men?
		기억나는 얼굴이 있어요?
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	No, but I've seen enough
		to identify the killer.
		아니, 범인을 맞출만큼 분석이 끝났어. 
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Or, more specifically,
		좀더 정확히 말하면 
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	your mascot here has
		smelled enough.
		여기 마스코트견이 맡아내 줄 겁니다. 
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:42	What's his name?
		이름이 뭐죠?
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	Hoser.
		호저요.
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:44	Naturally. Uh, may I?
		과연. 잠깐 빌릴까요? 
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:47	Come on, Hoser.
		이리와, 호저. 
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:49	We've all heard of dogs that
		have found their way home
		수천마일 밖에서도 
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	from thousands of miles away.
		집을 찾아오는 개들에 관해 들었을 겁니다. 
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	That's because these animals
		have a sixth sense.
		동물에겐 육감이 있기 때문이죠.
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:57	Natural disasters, the
		presence of spirits,
		동물은 자연재해, 영적인 존재를 감지하고 
00:13:59	 
		 
00:13:59	some of them can
		even detect cancer.
		몇몇은 심지어 암을 발견하기도 합니다.
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	That's a bunch of crap.
		무슨 헛소리야.
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Really?
		아, 그래요?
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	An Atlanta woman credits
		her dog Floyd Henry
		애틀랜타에 사는 한 여성은 애완견 플로이드 헨리가
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	for pawing a cancerous tumor
		which saved her life.
		자신의 종양 자리를 할퀴어 목숨을 살렸다고 믿습니다.
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	Why do I remember that?
		이런건 대체 왜 기억하는거지?
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:13	In any case, on my command,
		our canine friend here
		제가 명령만 하면 여기 멍멍이 친구가 
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	will use his
		extrasensory perception
		탁월한 초감각을 발휘해 
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	to sniff out a killer's guilt...
		살인자의 죄책감을 읽어낼 겁니다. 
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	And I do believe he's found it.
		또한 그럴 수 있을거라 믿습니다. 
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	Hoser, go get the killer.
		호저, 범인을 찾아내!
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:30	- Huh.
		- Hey.
		 
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:34	What's this?
		이게 뭐야?
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	Smoked kipper.
		청어 그을린거요.
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:37	Also known as red herring.
		그러니까 훈제청어요.
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:39	I found it in your kitchen.
		부엌에서 찾았어요.
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:42	What?
		뭐요?
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:45	What's not funny?
		이거 안 웃겨요?
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	What's going on here?
		지금 뭐하시는 겁니까?
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	You said I cause trouble.
		진상을 부리면 된다며.
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	Yeah, to help the investigation.
		수사에 도움이 되는 걸로요.
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:51	That guy's the paramedic
		that saved your life.
		그분이 바로 제인씨 목숨 구해준 분이세요.
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	Oh, well, thank you very much.
		아, 그렇구나. 이 분이셨구나. 감사합니다.
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	No problem.
		뭘요.
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	- Are we done here?
		- Not by a mile.
		- 일은 다 보셨습니까?
		- 택도 없는데. 
00:14:59	 
		 
00:15:00	When Hoser here was, uh,
		pouncing on my rescuer,
		호저가 제 생명의 은인에게 달려들때 
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	I couldn't help but notice
		a profound sense of relief
		전 누군가 뚜렷이 안도함을 알아챘습니다.
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	from...
		바로, 
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:09	you, sir.
		선생님이십니다. 
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:12	What's your relationship
		with the deceased?
		피해자와의 관계는 어떻게 되십니까?
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	Um, not much.
		별로 친하지 않았는데요.
00:15:16	 
		 
00:15:16	No sad feelings,
		no wedding ring.
		슬퍼하는 것 같지도 않고 결혼반지도 없고 
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:20	That's ladies' perfume,
		여자 향수 냄새. 
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:21	with a top note of orange
		mixed with bitter almond--
		톱노트는 오렌지와 아몬드향을 뒤섞었네.
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	that's not a young
		woman's fragrance.
		어린 아가씨들이 쓰는 향이 아니죠.
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	Were you sleeping with
		the victim's wife?
		피해자 부인과 관계했습니까?
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	That's offensive.
		Firefighters are a brotherhood.
		인신공격이요. 소방관들은 형제같은 사이요.
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	Wives are off-limits.
		아내를 건들다니 말도 안되오.
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	Well, tell him that.
		그 말 그대로 해봐요.
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	I think it's time for you to go.
		가주셔야겠습니다.
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	Huh, Larkin?
		라킨씨?
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	- I said it's time for you to go.
		- It's okay, cap.
		- 가주셔야겠습니다.
		- 됐습니다, 대장님. 
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:46	It's all gonna come out anyway.
		언젠가는 밝혀질 일인데요.
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:51	What he said is true.
		이 사람 말대롭니다. 
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:54	I was having an affair
		with Paul's wife.
		폴의 부인과 잤습니다.
00:15:57	 
		 
00:16:00	How was that?
		어땠어?
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:01	Yeah. Just like the old you.
		평소 제인씨 같네요.
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:09	Heard you riled 'em up in there.
		소방서를 들쑤시고 왔다며.
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	Sounds like the Jane I know.
		내가 아는 제인 같더라. 
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	Hmm.
		흠. 
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:15	Is anything coming back to you?
		뭐 기억나는건 없고? 
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:18	Kids prefer cheese over
		fried green spinach.
		애들은(Kids) 튀긴(Fried) 녹색(Green) 시금치(Spinach)보다(Over) 치즈를(Cheese) 좋아해(Prefer).
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:22	Come again?
		뭐라고?
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	It's an acronym for the
		seven levels of taxonomy--
		분류학 일곱단계의 머릿글자를 딴거야.
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	kingdom, phylum, class, order,
		family, genus, species.
		문, 강, 목, 과, 속, 종.(역주: kingdom, phylum, class, order,family, genus, species.)
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	Impressive.
		대단한데. 
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	I can also name the
		geological time periods,
		각 지질시대의 이름도 기억나.
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	the world's longest
		rivers by size
		세계에서 가장 긴 강이나 
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	and the complete
		works of Shakespeare
		셰익스피어의 저작을
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	in chronological order.
		연대순으로 나열할 수도 있어. 
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	So the memory palace is intact.
		기억 궁전엔 문제가 없다는 말이네. 
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	I told you about
		the memory palace?
		내가 그 얘기까지 했어?
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	We're friends.
		우린 친구라고. 
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:47	The doctor says it's
		your emotional memories
		의사 말론 기억이 돌아오지 않는건
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	that are tripping you up.
		마음의 문제래. 
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	Does anything come back to you?
		뭐든간에 떠오르는게 있어?
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	Anything at all?
		전혀?
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	No.
		전혀. 
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:56	What do you remember about this?
		그럼 이건?
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	My wedding ring?
		결혼반지?
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	No better way to
		gain a woman's trust
		여자한테 신뢰를 주는데 
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	than to wear a wedding ring,
		except maybe buy a dog,
		결혼반지만한게 없지. 그밖에는 개를 기르는건데 
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	but who wants that mess?
		개수발은 누가 들어?
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	Okay. So you wear a wedding
		ring to get over on women?
		여자한테 작업하려고 낀 반지다?
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	Worked on you.
		너한테도 통하잖아. 
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:10	You remember the house fire
		that we saw on the newscast?
		뉴스로 본 화재사건 기억하지?
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:14	It was the only call that
		the victim responded to
		그날 피해자가 출동한 
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	the day that he was murdered.
		유일한 사건이래. 
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	I'm gonna have Cho go and
		take a look at the house.
		조더러 화재 현장을 돌아보라 시켰어. 
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	I want you to go with him.
		같이 가.
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	So it's his turn
		to babysit me now?
		이제 그 친구가 애 볼 차례야?
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	Well, somebody has to.
		누군가는 해야겠지. 
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:25	Pleasant weather.
		날씨 한번 좋다. 
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	Has it been like this all week?
		일주일 내내 이랬어?
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	I guess. Why?
		그랬을걸. 왜?
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	Big elephants can always
		understand small elephants,
		큰(Big) 코끼리는(Elephant) 언제나(Always) 작은(Small) 코끼리를(Elephants) 이해하느니(Understand).
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:35	because, Teresa, because.
		"because", 테레사. 
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	Oh. Oh, I get it.
		It's another acronym.
		아, 알겠어. 그것도 앞글자를 따는거구나.
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	Mm.
		음.
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:45	Were you at the firehouse
		피해자가 죽던날 밤 
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	the night the victim
		was murdered?
		소방서에 있었습니까?
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	I left early to go to
		the bachelor party.
		총각 파티 때문에 일찍 떠났습니다.
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	You with anyone?
		누구랑요?
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	No.
		혼자서요.
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	So you could have circled back?
		범행을 저지르고 돌아왔을수도 있는거네요?
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	I could have, but I didn't.
		있긴한데 안 그랬습니다.
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	Why were you sleeping
		with Mrs. Satterfield?
		왜 세터필드 부인과 잤죠?
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:02	It felt good.
		좋으니까요.
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	Good enough to want
		her husband dead?
		그 남편을 죽이고 싶을 만큼?
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	I didn't want him dead.
		세터필드를 죽이고 싶은 적 없습니다. 
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	Oh, no?
		그래요?
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	Well, I checked
		yesterday's logs.
		어젯밤 근무일지를 봤는데 
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	And you were Satterfield's
		partner in that house fire.
		어제 현장에서 세터필드의 파트너셨네요.
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	You let him go upstairs
		without backup, alone.
		지원없이 2층으로 올라가게 하셨죠.
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	I was the one who was left
		without backup, okay?
		나야말로 지원없이 혼자 된 사람이었소.
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:19	We live and die by SOGs--
		do you know what those are?
		우린 SOG에 죽고살지. 그게 뭔지 아쇼?
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:23	Standard Operating Guidelines.
		정규작전교범(Standard Operating Guidelines).
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	Yeah.
		그렇소. 
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	And we were conducting a
		standard left-hand search
		상당히 화재가 진행된 현장에선 
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	of a fully involved house,
		왼손 수색 규칙을 지켜야 합니다. 
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	when Paul decides to run
		upstairs and find the homeowner.
		근데 폴은 집주인을 찾겠다고 위로 갔어요.
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	Why didn't you go with him?
		왜 같이 가지 않으셨죠?
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	He left me in a smoke-filled
		room with zero visibility.
		제로시야의 연기로 꽉 찬 방에 날 두고 갔습니다.
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	I couldn't see my hand
		in front of my face,
		바로 눈앞의 손조차 보이지 않았어요.
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	much less which way he ran.
		어디로 갔는지도 몰랐죠.
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:47	That's the way it was with Paul.
		그게 그의 방식이지. 
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	He could break every rule,
		모든 규칙은 무시. 
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:53	leave his partner in danger,
		파트너는 죽든말든. 
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:55	and still he's the hero.
		본인만 영화를 찍으면 되니까. 
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	So why didn't you
		tell the captain?
		왜 대장에게 그렇게 말하지 않았죠?
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Paul was good press.
		폴에 대한 여론이 좋으니까요.
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:04	Look, I feel bad that he's gone.
		폴이 그렇게 죽어 유감입니다.
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:08	But I'll tell you what--
		하지만 말입니다, 
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:09	I am glad that I don't
		have to count on him
		다음 화재에서 그놈과 한 조가 될 일이 없다 생각하니 
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	to cover my back
		at the next fire.
		기쁘기도 하네요.
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:21	You take this side
		of the street.
		저쪽을 맡으십쇼.
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Find out if the neighbors
		saw the victim
		피해자가 현장에서 수상한 누군가와 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	interacting with anyone
		suspicious during the fire.
		접촉이 없었는지 탐문하십쇼.
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	You want me to go door
		to door like a salesman?
		외판원처럼 이집저집 두들기고 다니라고?
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	You do it all the time.
		항상 하시는 일입니다. 
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	You say it's one of the
		more interesting things
		그게 수사 자문으로서 가장 마음에 드는 
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	about being a consultant.
		일 가운데 하나라고도 하셨는데요.
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:36	You're a clever one, Mr. Cho,
		자넨 똑똑한 친구같아, 조. 
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	and I'll do your bidding,
		곧 그 분부대로 합지요.
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	but first I wanna take a look
		at this burned-out house.
		하지만 불탄집부터 먼저 봐야겠어. 
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:42	When can I go inside?
		I-I need to get in there.
		언제쯤 들어갈 수 있습니까? 들어가야 한다고요.
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	CBI. What's going on here?
		CBI입니다. 무슨 일이시죠?
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	They won't let me
		inside my house.
		내 집에 못 들어가게 합니다. 
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	It's a standard arson
		investigation.
		방화사건의 절차입니다. 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	We'll call him when it's over.
		사건수사가 종결되면 연락드릴 겁니다.
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	This is crazy.
		이건 미친 짓이야.
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	Why would I set
		fire to my house?
		내가 왜 내 집에 불을 내겠어요?
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	Everything I own is in there.
		전재산이 여기 있는데. 
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	- My kid's childhood--
		- No one's accusing you, sir.
		- 우리 애가 여기서 자랐고.. 
		- 아무도 선생님을 지목하지 않았습니다.
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	I know you.
		I-I saw you on the TV.
		아, 나 이 사람 아는데. tv에서 봤는데. 
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	The fireman saved your life.
		Patrick Jane.
		소방관이 구해준 그분이죠? 패트릭 제인입니다. 
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:06	Tom Wilcox.
		톰 윌콕스입니다. 
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	I almost died yesterday, too,
		but, uh, no news cameras.
		저도 어제 거의 죽다 살아났는데. 방송은 못 탔네요.
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	Did you know the man who
		pulled you from the fire
		어젯밤 선생님을 구한
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	was killed last night?
		소방관이 살해됐단 소식을 들으셨습니까?
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	Yeah, I... read it in the paper.
		신문에서 봤어요.
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:18	I didn't even get a
		chance to thank him.
		고맙단 인사도 못했는데. 
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	Did you see the victim
		in conflict with anyone
		구조 중에 그 소방관이 
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	during your rescue?
		누군가와 다투지는 않았습니까?
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	No, I was unconscious
		the whole time.
		전 계속 의식이 없었거든요. 
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	Me, too. The guy was behind me
		with my head under the water.
		저도요. 왠놈이 뒤에서 덮쳐서 물속으로 찍어 눌렀어요.
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	How did you black out?
		어떻게 눈 앞이 깜깜해지던가요?
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:30	Well, when the fire
		jumped the fireplace,
		불이 벽난로에서 치솟자 
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	I ran upstairs and grabbed all
		the valuables that I could,
		이층으로 도망가 귀중품을 챙겼어요.
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	but the smoke was too thick,
		and I couldn't breathe.
		그런데 연기가 너무 짙어져 숨을 쉬지 못했죠.
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	Well, we both cheated death.
		우리 둘다 간발의 차로 살았네요.
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:39	That--that's just--
		that's remarkable.
		이거 정말 쉽지 않은데. 
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	You know, we should
		get t-shirts made up.
		나란히 단체티라도 맞추는게 어때요?
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:42	Well, I-I'm glad
		that you're happy,
		기분이 좋으시다면야 말리진 않겠지만 
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	but I just lost
		everything that I own.
		저는 전재산을 잃었습니다. 
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	I got my wife and my daughter
		in a motel I can't afford.
		가족들을 피신시킨 모텔비 댈 돈도 없어요.
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	Nothing but the
		clothes on our backs.
		갈아입을 옷도 없구요.
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	You can ask your
		insurance company
		보험회사에다 말해서 
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	for an advance on the claim.
		보험금을 미리 청구하십쇼.
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:57	My house isn't insured.
		보험 적용이 안된 집이에요.
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	I-I mean it was, but...
		예전엔 됐는데 
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	I'm a Savings And Loan officer,
		은행에서 대출 담당자였거든요.
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	and ever since the
		banks collapsed,
		그런데 은행이 도산한 후에는
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	I've been out of work.
		실업자 신세예요.
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	Okay. Well, let's forget
		about the t-shirts, then.
		제가 말한 단체티는 잊어버리세요.
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	Uh, Mr. Cho,
		조요원. 
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	let's say we give this poor man
		a ride back to his family.
		이 가엾은 분 모텔까지만이라도 태워다 드리지. 
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	Come on.
		갑시다.
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:16	Okay, thanks. Hey, boss?
		반장님?
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	On Rigsby's advice,
		I went through
		릭스비 말대로 
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Mrs. Satterfield's
		credit reports.
		세터필드 부인의 계좌내역을 조회했어요.
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	Take a look at this.
		한번 보세요.
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:26	Looks like our grieving widow
		had a lot to celebrate.
		우리 미망인이 로또 맞았군.
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	Yeah.
		 
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:30	I'm thinking about using
		that life insurance money
		사망 보험금 받아서 
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:33	to redo my kitchen.
		부엌이나 개조하려구요.
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:34	No offense, Mrs. Satterfield,
		but you're quite brazen.
		이런 말은 참 뭐하지만 굉장히 뻔뻔하시네요.
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	Which means you're either
		innocent or stupid.
		결백하거나 아주 멍청한 범인이란 뜻이겠죠.
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	Well, she doubled down on her
		husband's life insurance policy
		남편이 살해되기 한달 전에 
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	a month before his murder.
		보험료를 두배로 올렸네요.
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	I'm going with stupid.
		저라면 멍청하다에 걸겠습니다.
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	Wouldn't be the first
		time a cheating wife
		불륜 중의 부인들이 
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	arranged for her
		husband's death.
		남편이 죽길 유도하는건 흔하거든요.
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	You think I was unfaithful?
		제가 신의없는 사람 같아요?
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:51	You were sleeping
		with another man.
		다른 남자랑 관계하셨잖아요.
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:54	Paul knew about my affair.
		폴은 제 불륜 사실을 알았어요.
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	Truth is, he was relieved.
		그리고는 안도했죠.
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:58	I stopped begging
		for his attention.
		귀찮은게 떨어져 나갔으니까.
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	You see, he could never
		give me what I wanted.
		그는 제가 바라던걸 결코 주지 못했어요.
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	Which was?
		뭐였습니까?
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	A marriage.
		남편. 
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:06	He left ours years ago.
		그는 수년전에 가족을 버렸어요.
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:09	My husband was a junkie.
		남편은 중독자였죠.
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	- Heroin?
		- Adrenaline.
		- 헤로인?
		- 아드레날린. 
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	Couldn't get enough of it.
		끊지를 못했어요.
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Drinking in all that glory,
		그 영예에 취해서 
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	dancing in the fire...
		불길 속에 뛰어드는.. 
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	How do you compete with
		the high of being a hero?
		영웅으로 떠받들어지는 기분을 어디 비기겠어요?
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	Hmm?
		 
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:24	Why didn't you just leave him?
		아주 이혼하지 그러셨어요?
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	And what kind of a settlement
		소방관 아내로 살아서 
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	am I gonna get from
		a firefighter?
		마음이 편할 일이 있었을까요?
00:22:30	 
		 
00:22:30	I upped the policy because his
		death was just a matter of time.
		저러다 죽는건 시간문제다 싶어서 보험료를 올렸어요.
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:34	Every day, a race towards
		the edge of a cliff.
		남편은 매일 벼랑을 향해 질주했죠.
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	I bet getting stabbed was the
		biggest rush of his life.
		그러다 좀 멀리 간 거예요. 칼에 찔린 건. 
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:52	Thanks for the ride.
		태워주셔서 고맙습니다. 
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	It's, uh, it's been a tough day.
		정말이지 정신없는 하루네요.
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:57	Hi, dad!
		아빠!
00:22:58	 
		 
00:22:58	Hey, baby.
		안녕.
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	Who are your friends?
		당신 친구들이야?
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	I'm agent Cho.
		This is Patrick Jane.
		조요원이고 이쪽은 패트릭 제인입니다.
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	We're investigating the
		murder of Paul Satterfield.
		폴 세터필드 사건을 수사중입니다. 
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:05	Oh, I was just reading
		about him in the paper.
		신문에서 봤어요.
00:23:07	 
		 
00:23:07	So sad.
		어쩜 좋아. 
00:23:09	 
		 
00:23:09	Lulu would be without
		a father right now
		그분이 아니었다면 
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:11	if it weren't for him.
		루루가 아빠 없는 애가 될 뻔 했는데. 
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	Do you know anything
		about the funeral?
		장례식에 관해 좀 아세요?
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:14	Uh, we'd like to be there.
		저희도 가봐야 할 것 같아서. 
00:23:16	 
		 
00:23:16	Well, they usually have that
		information in the story.
		기사 보면 보통 나오던데. 
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	Let me have a look here.
		잠깐 볼게요.
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	Oh, this clown again.
		레슬러가 여기도 있네. 
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:22	He's stealing a lot of press
		from our fallen hero.
		우리 가엾은 영웅이 차지할 지면을 많이도 뺏어갔어.
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	Did you find my dolls?
		아빠, 내 인형은?
00:23:26	 
		 
00:23:27	I'm afraid not, honey.
		미안한데 못 찾았어. 
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	I still haven't been able
		to get inside our house.
		집에 들어갈 수 없었단다. 
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:32	Well, not to fear.
		걱정하지 마세요.
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	Mister, uh, Cho here and I
		will go back to your home
		여기 조요원과 제가 집에 들어가서 
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:36	and see what we can find
		to make your life easier.
		선생님께 도움될게 남았는지 보겠습니다. 
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:39	Yes!
		앗싸!
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:41	No, you don't have to do that.
		It's okay.
		그러실 필요까진 없는데. 괜찮습니다. 
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	I miss my dolls.
		내 인형!
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:46	Not for long.
		금방 찾아다줄게. 
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	Thank you, both of you.
		두분 정말 감사드려요.
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:50	Shall we?
		갈까?
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:57	What's your play here?
		무슨 속셈입니까?
00:23:59	 
		 
00:23:59	I don't know what you mean.
		무슨 소린지 모르겠군. 
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:00	What are you trying to do?
		목적이 뭡니까?
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	Well, bring a ray of hope
		to a family, I suppose.
		가엾은 일가에게 희망의 빛을 전달해주기?
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	And help my friends
		solve a crime.
		그리고 친구들의 사건 수사도 돕고. 
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:11	I don't buy it.
		우습지도 않군요.
00:24:13	 
		 
00:24:13	You don't help us
		because you like us.
		당신이 언제는 우리 좋으라고 수사했습니까.
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:17	I don't like you?
		나랑 자네랑 안 좋아?
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:19	Well, you don't not like us.
		우리를 좋아하지 않는건 아니죠. 
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:21	But you have deeper reasons
		for helping people.
		하지만 이 일을 하는덴 다른 이유가 있잖습니까.
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:24	Without those reasons,
		you're a hustler.
		그 이유가 없는 당신은 그저 사기꾼이죠.
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	So what's your play?
		그러니, 지금은 무슨 꿍꿍입니까?
00:24:28	 
		 
00:24:30	You're wrong about me, Mr. Cho.
		요원은 날 오해하고 있어.
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	I do like you.
		난 요원 좋아해. 
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:35	And I can assure you I wanna
		help that little girl
		그리고 난 진심으로 그 인형 찾아서 
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	find her lost doll.
		아이한테 돌려주고 싶어. 
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:39	Okay.
		알겠습니다.
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:57	What's wrong?
		왜 그러십니까?
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	This doll. It...
		reminds me of something.
		이 인형 말이야. 보니까 생각이 나.
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	I can't--I can't quite...
		나, 나는... 
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:08	It's your family?
		가족 말입니까?
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:12	Yeah, my family.
		그래, 내 가족. 
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:17	I can't believe I-I...
		나는 도무지...도무지가.. 
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:21	How could I forget my family?
		내가 어떻게 식구들을 잊었을까?
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:26	I'm sorry.
		미안합니다.
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:31	Could you give me a
		minute, please, Mr. Cho?
		잠깐만 혼자 있게 해 주겠어, 조요원?
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:35	Sure. I'll wait outside.
		그러죠. 밖에서 기다리겠습니다.
00:25:37	 
		 
00:26:08	Jane?
		제인?
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:26	Okay, if he does show up,
		please call us right away.
		알겠습니다. 나타나면 즉시 연락주세요.
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	Thank you.
		감사합니다.
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:31	He's not at the hospital.
		병원에도 없어요. 
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	I'm starting to get worried.
		이제 슬슬 걱정되네. 
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	- It's not like he has any money or ID.
		- Uh, yeah, he has money.
		- 돈이나 신분증도 없을텐데. 
		- 아, 그게. 있어요.
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:38	Found this in my wallet when we
		got back from the fire station.
		소방서 갔다 돌아오니 지갑에 꽃혀 있었어요.
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	- "IOU 60 bucks"?
		- Yet I'm $63 light.
		- "60달러 꾼다♡"?
		- 비는건 63달러인데. 
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	He wasn't even
		honest about that.
		심지어는 이 숫자마저 속이네요.
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	Let's start calling
		local cab companies,
		택시 회사에 문의해서 
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	see if any of the drivers
		remember giving him a ride.
		제인을 태운 적이 있는지 알아봐.
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	This is my fault.
		I'm the one he conned.
		제 실숩니다. 예전에 한번 털려놓고 
00:26:51	This is my fault.
		I'm the one he conned.
		 
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	- I should know better.
		- So should I.
		- 더 경계했어야 했는데. 
		- 그건 나도 마찬가지야.
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:52	I'm the one who got him
		out of the hospital.
		병원에서 데려나온게 난데. 
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	We were all marks today.
		오늘 우리 전부한테 사기치고 다닌거야.
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	Not me.
		전 아닌데. 
00:26:58	 
		 
00:26:59	What? He didn't con me.
		왜요? 전 당한거 없어요.
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:01	Yeah, only because he wants
		to have a date with you.
		왜냐면 너랑 어떻게 해보려고 난리 났거든. 
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	Really?
		진짜?
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	Look, don't take
		this the wrong way,
		내 말 절대 오해는 말되, 
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	but the death of Jane's family
		made him a better person.
		하지만 제인은 그 사고 후에 확실히 인간 됐어.
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	And that person was
		always inside of him.
		제인은 원래 그런 좋은 사람이야.
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	The murder just brought it out.
		사고로 말미암아 표면에 드러난거지. 
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	Rigsby. Slow down. Who is this?
		릭스비입니다. 천천히 말씀하세요. 누구시라구요?
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:17	Are you drunk?
		지금 취했어요?
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:19	No, I do not do
		spiritual readings.
		아뇨, 저 영계 교신 안해요.
00:27:20	You must have the wrong number.
		 
		전화 잘못 거셨네요.
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:21	- No, stop! No, stop!
		- Don't hang up!
		- 야, 끊지마!
		- 끊지마! 
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:23	Hello?
		Where are you calling from?
		여보세요? 너 어디야?
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:27	Okay. I'm being pulled
		in this direction.
		이 방향으로 끌리는 기분이 있네요.
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:31	There's an older woman, an aunt
		or a cousin coming through.
		중후하신 여성분입니다. 누군가의 이모 혹은 사촌분이신가봐요.
00:27:35	 
		 
00:27:35	There's a "K" connection--
		K의 강한 기운이 있습니다.
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:39	a "K" connection
		somewhere over here.
		여기 어딘가 K와 강한 연관을 가진 분이 계세요.
00:27:42	 
		 
00:27:43	My mother's name was Kate.
		우리 엄마 이름이 케이트예요.
00:27:45	 
		 
00:27:46	Twins.
		She's saying something about--
		쌍둥이. 뭔가에 대해 말씀하시는데.. 
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	what do you know about twins?
		쌍둥이가 무슨 의미인지 아시나요?
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	I'm a gemini.
		제 별자리가 쌍둥이 자리예요.
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	Ah. That's your mother's way of
		letting you know she's here.
		당신이 여기 계시다고 어머님이 그렇게 알려주시는군요.
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	She's letting me know it's
		very important that you know--
		이번 기회가 아니면 
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:58	that you know this
		is her opportunity
		당신과 말씀 나누실 기회가 없다며 
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	to make a connection.
		제게 꼭 당부하십니다. 
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	This is her chance
		to come through.
		이 기회가 아니면 건너오실 수가 없다구요.
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:05	Okay.
		아, 
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	Okay.
		네네. 
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	Your mother's saying...
		she was killed.
		우리 어머니께서 ...죽임당하셨네요.
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:14	What I mean by that is...
		그러니까 제 말 뜻은, 
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:17	hers was not a natural passing.
		자연스러운 죽음이 아니란 뜻이죠.
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:20	Is that right?
		맞습니까?
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	It was a car crash.
		교통사고였어요.
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:23	Okay. I'm sorry. Okay.
		그렇군요. 유감입니다. 
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:28	That's how you lost her.
		You lost her in a car crash.
		어머님을 그렇게 잃으셨군요. 차사고로 잃으셨어요.
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	That's what you tell people--
		사람들에게 그렇게 말씀하시죠.
00:28:32	 
		 
00:28:32	"I lost my mother
		in a car crash.
		난 어머니를 차사고로 잃었다.
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	I lost her. I lost her."
		잃었다, 어머니를 잃었다고.
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:37	But what you're forgetting
		is that she lost you, too.
		하지만 어머님 역시 당신을 잃으셨음을 잊고 계시네요.
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:42	And there is no greater loss
		than a parent's loss of a child,
		부모에게 자식을 잃는 것보다 더 큰 슬픔이 어디 있겠습니까.
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	but it's okay.
		하지만 괜찮습니다.
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	She wants you to know it's okay,
		자신은 괜찮다고 말씀하시네요.
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	'cause she's here with you.
		왜냐면 어머니께서 함께 하실 것이기 때문이죠.
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	She's here tonight,
		and she's telling me
		오늘밤 어머님이 여기 오셨습니다.
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	that she wants a hug.
		한번 꼭 껴안아달라고 하시네요.
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:54	A huge hug. Come here.
		껴안아 달라고. 이리 오세요.
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	Come here.
		이리 오세요.
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:58	Come on, please. Come on.
		이리 오세요. 괜찮아요.
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:01	It's okay.
		괜찮습니다.
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:03	Oh, that's okay.
		괜찮고말고요.
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:06	I hate him.
		개짜증나요.
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:08	That's not him.
		아프잖아. 
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:11	You're very brave.
		용감하셨습니다.
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	You have a very
		strong connection.
		어머님과 강렬한 연이 남아 계세요.
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	You won't lose that now.
		이제 놓치지 않으실 겁니다.
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	Thank you, folks. Whoo.
		지켜봐 주셔서 감사합니다.
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:28	Hi.
		안녕.
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	What are you doing?
		여기서 뭐하는 거야?
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:31	What's it look like? Business.
		뭐처럼 보여? 비즈니스지. 
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:32	Excuse me. May I?
		실례지만 좀 마실까요?
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:35	This is Rigsby's card.
		이건 릭스비 명함이잖아요.
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	Yeah, just--you know,
		아, 거야 그... 
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	just until I get
		my own printed up.
		내 이름 박은거 나올때까지 임시로 쓰는거야.
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	You said at the hospital
		that you were dying to help.
		병원에서는 수사 돕고 싶어 죽겠다며
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:41	This is not helping.
		쥐뿔도 도움이 안되고 있잖아.
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:43	I am.
		하고 있어.
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:44	I'm investigating.
		I felt bad about the fish stunt
		수사 하고 있어. 
00:29:47	 
		 
00:29:47	I pulled on these boys,
		호수에서의 습격이 영 찜찜해서 
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	so, uh, I decided to
		take the "B" shift out
		B팀 인원들을 불러내 
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:51	for a night on the town--
		you know, get to know 'em,
		술을 마시며 됨됨이를 파악했어. 
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:53	make sure they're all
		innocent of murder.
		결백한지 범인인지 알려고. 
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	Are they?
		그래서?
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	They're the best of the best!
		싸나이중의 싸나이지!
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:58	- Yep! Yep!
		- You are the man, Paddy!
		- 이예!
		- 너는 진짜 남자중의 남자야 패티!
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	- Thank you!
		- Cheers!
		- 감사합니다!
		- 건배!
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	Cheers!
		건배!
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	Oh, by the way, he
		got the last round.
		그건 그렇고 방금 저 친구가 쐈어.
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	Could you thank him for me?
		내 대신 고맙다고 말 좀 해줄래? 
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:05	We're going back to
		the hospital now.
		우린 지금 당장 너 데리고 병원 갈거야.
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	I'm gonna take a
		rain check on that.
		고건 다음 기회로 미룰게. 
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	I got another show later.
		조금 쉬고 다시 무대에 올라야 하거든. 
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	You should stick around.
		I'm best with the late crowd.
		너도 꼭 봐둬. 내가 원래 늦은 시각일수록 관객을 기가막히게 후린다니까. 
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	Are you gonna make
		me call backup
		내가 지원 부를테니 한번 여기서 질질 끌려 나가볼래?
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	to get you out of this bar?
		Because I will do that, Paddy.
		왜냐면 난 그럴거거든, 패티. 
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:20	Gentlemen...
		신사 여러분... 
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:22	The best of the best!
		싸나이 중의 싸나이!
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	- Yeah, buddy!
		- Hey, Paddy!
		- 친구!
		- 친구! 캬아!
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	- Salute.
		- Well said, my man, well said.
		- 경례. 
		- 말 한번 잘하네. 참 잘해. 
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	- Cheers.
		- Cheers.
		건배. 
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:34	I got it from here. Thanks.
		여기까지 바래다주면 됐어.
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:37	I'll see you in the morning.
		내일 아침에 보자구.
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:39	Uh, no.
		Actually, put a fork in it.
		아니, 아냐. 실은 여기서 종칠래. 
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:42	I'm done. No more police work.
		집어칠거야. 경찰 일 이제 안해. 
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:45	I understand.
		그러도록 해. 
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	You can stay in the hospital
		until you get your memory back.
		기억이 돌아올 때까지 병원에 머물러도 돼. 
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	What if I don't get it back?
		만약 안 돌아오면?
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:52	I talked to my
		paramedic friends.
		구급대원 친구들이 말하는데 
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	They told me that all I need to
		be released from this hospital
		법적 성인의 싸인 동의만 있으면 
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	is the signature from
		a responsible adult,
		병원에서 나갈 수 있대. 
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	and I got some pretty
		tasty offers tonight.
		게다가 오늘 여자들이 아주 줄을 서더라니까. 
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:04	I'm telling you,
		this wedding ring--
		내가 뭐랬게 이 반지가... 
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	I can make you stay, you know.
		난 너 여기 남게 할 수 있어.
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:08	It's in my power to hold you
		살인사건 수사의 중요 증인으로 
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	as a material witness in
		a murder investigation.
		붙잡아 둘 권한이 있다고. 
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:13	Why would you do that?
		나한테 왜 그러는건데?
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:16	You think I can't see
		what's going on here?
		나라고 눈이 없는 줄 알아?
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:19	You people--you're--
		you're tiptoeing.
		너희 전부, 너, 내 뒤에서 살금살금. 조심조심. 
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	You're dancing around
		some forgotten tragedy.
		나만 잊어버린 끔찍한 일 때문에 벌벌 떨고 있잖아.
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:26	I'm happy now. Just...
		나 지금 행복해. 그러니까... 
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:30	Just let me be happy.
		그러니까 계속 행복하게 내버려둬.
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:34	Fair enough.
		틀린 말 아니다.
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	Look, I'll miss you, but
		I'll leave you alone, okay?
		네가 그립겠지만, 가게 놔줄게. 알았지? 
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:39	Thank you, Teresa.
		I appreciate it.
		고마워, 테레사. 고맙다.
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:46	Any parting thoughts
		on the murder?
		헤어지는 마당에 사건에 대해선 해줄말 없고?
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	Yeah, I figured out who
		killed the fireman.
		범인은 찾은것 같아.
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	You did? Who?
		정말? 누구야?
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:53	Jacket left pocket.
		웃저고리 왼쪽 주머니. 
00:31:55	 
		 
00:32:01	Kind of obvious,
		don't you think?
		설명이 필요없지?
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	No.
		아니.
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:05	You need me to spell
		it out for you?
		일일이 읽어줘?
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	Yes.
		응. 
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:09	I suppose you need me to
		gift wrap the killer, too?
		범인을 포장까지 해서 바쳐내라는거지?
00:32:11	 
		 
00:32:12	You usually do.
		너 대개 그랬어.
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:17	My parting gift to you I
		will give tomorrow morning.
		내 이별선물은 내일 아침 갖다줄게. 
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	Good night.
		잘자. 
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:27	There's room up here.
		아니면 일루 올라오든가. 
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:34	Moving van, huh?
		이사하시나 봐요?
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	You have to put a
		deposit down on that?
		어떻게 차를 빌렸습니까?
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	I thought you were broke.
		완전히 빈털터리가 되신줄 알았는데. 
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:39	Well, the investigation is over.
		수사가 끝나서 
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:42	They let me in the house,
		집에 들어가 보니까 
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:43	and I found our emergency
		cash, thank God.
		천만다행으로 비상금이 남아있지 뭐예요.
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:47	And now you're going away?
		이제 떠나시는 거예요?
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	Montana.
		몬태나로요.
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	No. Prison.
		감옥이겠죠.
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:53	Put your game face
		on, cockroach,
		연기는 집어쳐, 바퀴같은 자식아. 
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	for the dignity of your family.
		네 마누라랑 딸아이 생각해서라도. 
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	Hello there.
		I got something for you.
		안녕, 애기야. 아저씨가 줄게 있어. 
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:01	I do. Look at this.
		이거 봐라. 
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	Marcy-Grace!
		마시 그레이스!
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	- Yes.
		- Oh, that is so nice of you.
		- 그렇지!
		- 어머, 너무 감사드려요.
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	What do you say, honey?
		아저씨한테 뭐라고 해야 하지?
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:07	- Thank you.
		- It's my pleasure.
		- 감사합니다.
		- 별일 아닌걸. 
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	I found something
		else in your house.
		집에서 다른 것도 발견했어요.
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:12	Well, we have to
		get on the road,
		지금 곧 떠나야해서 
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:13	so whatever it is, you
		can just keep it, okay?
		그게 뭐든간에 그냥 가지세요.
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	Come on. Get in the truck.
		Let's go.
		어서 차에 타. 가자.
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:19	Wait--what-- what's this about?
		잠깐요, 그게 뭔데요?
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	Well, I don't believe
		it's anything
		뭐건간에 따님이 들어선 
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:22	your daughter wants
		to hear about.
		좋지 않을 것 같군요.
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:25	Honey?
		여보?
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:28	Take her into the room.
		애 데리고 방에 가 있어. 
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	Just go. I'll-- I'll explain later.
		It's okay.
		나중에 설명할게. 들어가 있어. 
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:34	Come on, baby.
		가자, 루루. 
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:37	Get crazy with those
		cheese puffs, kid!
		까까 먹으면서 기다리렴! 
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	So cute.
		귀여워라.
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:41	Before I show you what I found,
		내가 찾은걸 보여주기 전에 
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	I have to tell you the
		story that goes with it.
		앞뒤 상황을 설명해야겠지. 
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	Um, it's a tale of an ATM
		robbery gone wrong.
		일단 망해버린 인출기 강도 계획부터 시작해야지.
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	I believe you read about
		it in the newspapers.
		신문으로 읽었을거라 믿어. 
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:57	Put the bags down!
		가방 내려놔,
00:33:59	 
		 
00:33:59	Do it!
		어서!
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:00	Now your guns. Slowly.
		네 총도 내려놔. 천천히. 
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:05	Well, I don't believe
		the masked robber
		복면 강도가 누굴 다치게 할 생각은 없었을테지만
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	intended to hurt anyone, but
		then again, they rarely do.
		가끔은 그런 일이 생기거든. 
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:12	The first thing a
		smart criminal does
		똑똑한 범죄자들이 제일 먼저 하는 일은 
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:14	is destroy the evidence.
		증거를 없애는 거지. 
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	Fire--that's a very
		popular way to do that.
		그러려면 불에 태우는게 가장 유명하지. 
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	With the fireplace alight,
		the masked robber
		벽난로를 피워놓고 강도는 
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	ran upstairs to lock his stash
		away in the bedroom safe.
		2층으로 올라가 금고를 잠갔어.
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:26	What he didn't know was
		the fire downstairs
		하지만 생각지도 못하게 
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	was now burning out of control.
		벽난로에서 불이 심하게 난거야. 
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:35	Well, excuse me, but what
		does this have to do with me?
		그런데 지금 이 얘기가 나랑 무슨 상관이요?
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	Bear with me.
		It's been a rough week.
		좀 참고 들어봐요. 힘든 한주였으니까.
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	Now when the masked robber
		1층에서 불이 난걸 
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:42	found the bottom floor
		of his house on fire,
		깨달은 강도는 
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:44	he should have run
		right out of there.
		도망치려 했어.
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:48	He couldn't abandon the
		cash, not after all that.
		하지만 현금을 두고갈 순 없었지. 
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	So he ran back upstairs.
		그래서 2층으로 도로 올라갔어.
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:52	Problem is the smoke
		was too thick.
		문제는 연기가 너무 짙어서 
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:54	He couldn't breathe.
		숨을 쉴 수 없게 된거야.
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:56	The masked robber passed out
		right there in his own bedroom.
		강도는 침실에서 기절해 버렸어.
00:34:59	 
		 
00:35:01	Are you accusing me
		of armed robbery?
		지금 내가 그 강도란 거요?
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	Yes.
		그렇습니다.
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	And murder.
		살인자이기도 하고.
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:06	Oh, and, uh, attempted
		murder, too.
		살인미수이기도 하고.
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:09	Mine.
		나 말예요.
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:10	Well, you must be desperate.
		억지도 이런 억지를 봤나. 
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	Hardly.
		I had you pegged from the start.
		난 당신 처음부터 수상했어. 
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	You know how armored
		guards operate
		당신은 은행에서 일하면서 
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	from your Savings And Loan days.
		무장 경비들의 움직임을 파악할 수 있었어. 
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	And who would light a fire
		on such a warm morning?
		게다가 요새처럼 화창한 날씨에 누가 아침부터 불을 피운담?
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:22	The hard part was to figure out
		가장 까다로운 부분은 
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	what would drive you to kill
		the man who saved your life?
		왜 자길 살려준 소방관을 죽였을까였어.
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:29	Then I realized that
		firefighter saw something
		그러다 결국 소방관이 불타는 집에서 
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	when he braved those
		flames to rescue you.
		당신을 구조하다 뭘 봤다는걸 깨달은거야.
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	Got an unconscious man in here.
		사람 하나, 의식이 없다.
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:35	Something that would send
		you to jail for life
		평생 감옥살이를 시킬 결정적인 증거. 
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:38	when he caught the news
		reports of the robbery
		불타는 집에서 그걸 본 순간 
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	and pieced together what he saw
		inside that burning house.
		은행강도 사건이 기억나면서 퍼즐이 맞춰진거지. 
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:50	The mask. It had to be.
		그건 아마도 돈가방과 함께 태우려던
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	It's what you were trying to
		burn with those bank bags.
		복면이었을거야.
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	It's what Satterfield
		saw in your bedroom,
		세터필드는 침실에서 복면을 봤어.
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	and that's why you
		had to kill him.
		그래서 당신을 그를 죽일 수 밖에 없었던거야.
00:35:59	 
		 
00:36:08	That's a scary story.
		무시무시한 이야기로군. 
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	But without proof,
		it's just a story.
		하지만 증거 없이는 소설에 불과해. 
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:13	Oh, almost forgot--
		거의 잊을 뻔했네. 
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:14	the other thing I
		found in the ashes.
		내가 잿더미에서 찾아낸 또다른 물건이야.
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:19	Yeah.
		 
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:20	I searched your house
		before you did, remember?
		내가 당신보다 먼저 집을 뒤졌지. 
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	I actually tried to
		crack your safe.
		당신 금고를 따려고도 해봤는데 
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	It's not my specialty.
		전공이 아니라서 안되더라고.
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:27	Don't worry.
		I'm not here to bust you.
		걱정마. 체포하러 온거 아니야.
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	There's nothing in that for me.
		I want half the money.
		체포해봐야 득도 안되는거. 돈 절반을 내게 줘.
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:33	Half the money.
		절반. 
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:35	Well, I think that's
		very generous.
		굉장히 착한 제안 같은데. 
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:37	I could ask for more.
		What choice do you have?
		더 달랠수도 있으니까. 어떡할거야?
00:36:40	 
		 
00:37:06	Half.
		반. 
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:13	Now the mask.
		이제 복면 줘.
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:14	Uh, yeah. The mask.
		Of course, yes.
		그래, 복면. 물론이지. 
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:17	You can have that there.
		가져.
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:29	Wait. This isn't mine.
		잠깐, 이건 내 것이 아닌데. 
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	No. I, uh, found that at
		a Mexican party store.
		파티용품점에서 샀어.
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:34	The colors are a good match,
		though, don't you think?
		색깔도 어울리고 좋으네, 안 그래?
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:37	Hands in the air where
		I can see them!
		머리 위로 손 들어!
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:38	Do it now!
		당장!
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:46	Turn around.
		돌아서.
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:58	I've always wanted
		a couch like that.
		언제나 저런 소파 하나 가지고 싶더라.
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:01	Who's this?
		누구셔?
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	Oh, this is my responsible
		adult--Tamara.
		날 퇴원시킨 법적 성인, 타마라.
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	Ta-mara.
		타-마라예요.
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:07	- Hi.
		- Hi.
		- 안녕하세요.
		- 안녕하세요.
00:38:09	 
		 
00:38:09	Well, you did it.
		해결했네. 
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	You caught a killer, and we got
		back most of the stolen cash.
		범인도 잡고 훔쳐간 돈도 대부분 되찾았어.
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	Most?
		대부분?
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:16	Wilcox was missing
		some of the money.
		윌콕스가 돈의 일부를 잃었어.
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	He said you took it, but
		we didn't believe it.
		네가 가져갔다는데 믿을수야 없지. 
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:22	I'd look for an accomplice.
		나같으면 공범을 찾겠어.
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	That's a big job
		to pull off alone.
		혼자 하긴 스케일이 너무 크거든. 
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:26	We'll do that.
		그러려고.
00:38:27	 
		 
00:38:27	Oh, by the way...
		그건 그렇고... 
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:30	your last paycheck.
		마지막 월급이야.
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:36	That's my payment?
		이거야?
00:38:37	 
		 
00:38:37	You weren't exactly
		in it for the money.
		돈보고 이 일한건 아니었거든. 
00:38:39	 
		 
00:38:39	Well, I'll confess to
		a vague satisfaction
		나보다 지들이 똑똑한 줄 아는 
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:41	in taking down someone
		병신들 엿먹이는 일에 
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:42	that thought they
		were smarter than me,
		만족감이 없다고야 할 수 없는데 
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:44	but not enough to wanna
		stick around here.
		그게 그 일을 계속 할 만큼은 아니야.
00:38:46	 
		 
00:38:46	Certainly not for this.
		더더군다나 이것 받고는. 
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	All right. Well, let me know
		if you change your mind,
		그래, 알았어. 마음 바뀌면 연락해. 
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:49	or, you know, get it back.
		돌아오려면 돌아오고. 
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:51	Some doors are best left shut.
		헤어지는게 윈윈일때도 있는거야.
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:53	Uh, everyone else, I-I'd
		just like to say thank you.
		아, 여러분 모두에겐 감사했습니다.
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	I'm sure we've shared some
		great times together.
		함께 일하는 내내 참 즐거웠다고 생각합니다.
00:38:59	 
		 
00:38:59	I'm not presently
		qualified to comment,
		이런 말엔 참 재주가 없으니
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:01	so I'm just gonna make like a rock...
		and roll.
		나가서 열심히 잘 살겠습니다.
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:05	Bye.
		그럼. 
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:08	Wait.
		잠깐.
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:11	That looks real.
		진짜 같은데. 
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:12	Sure does.
		그러네요.
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:16	You weren't lying.
		거짓말 아니었구나.
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:19	You took it.
		가져갔구나.
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:21	Wilcox wasn't lying.
		You really took it.
		윌콕스가 거짓말한게 아니라 진짜 니가 가져갔어.
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:26	I'm sure I have no idea
		what you're talking about.
		도무지 무슨 말을 하는건지 알 수가 없네. 
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:28	I-I'm late for my new life.
		새로운 삶이 나를 재촉해서 이만. 
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	Okay.
		 
00:39:31	 
		 
00:39:33	When did you grab the cash?
		언제 슬쩍한겁니까?
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:35	Oh, please, does
		it really matter?
		아 진짜, 그게 정말로 중요해?
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	I mean, you people are
		the highway robbers.
		솔직히 당신네들 칼만 안 들었지 강도야, 
00:39:39	 
		 
00:39:39	Look at this paycheck!
		내 월급 꼬라지를 봐! 
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	We could have you
		arrested for grand theft.
		절도죄로 잡아 넣을수도 있어요.
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:42	There's not a jury in the
		world that would convict me.
		날 기소할 배심원이 세상에 어딨어.
00:39:44	 
		 
00:39:44	I'm out of my mind.
		난 심신미약인데. 
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:46	Ask my doctor.
		내 의사한테 가서 물어봐.
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:47	You're running away.
		도망치는거구나.
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:49	What are you talking about?
		무슨 소리야?
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:50	You're starting to
		feel something inside
		속으로 뭔가 느껴지기 시작하면서도
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:52	and you don't know
		what to do with them.
		그걸 어떡해야 할지 모르겠으니까.
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	That's nonsense.
		모르는 소리 하지마!
00:39:55	 
		 
00:39:55	Prove it. Take a ride with me.
		증명해 보일테니 차 타고 어디 같이 가.
00:39:57	 
		 
00:39:57	If you still wanna leave
		after that, you can.
		그걸 보고도 가야겠다면, 보내줄게. 
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:21	Great house. Whose is it?
		집 끝내주네. 누구 집이야?
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:24	It's yours.
		네 집이야.
00:40:26	 
		 
00:40:27	Give me your keys.
		열쇠 줘.
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:29	Okay.
		그래. 
00:40:30	 
		 
00:41:48	I'm sorry.
		미안해.
