00:00:00	Previously, on "The Vampire Diaries"...
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:02	For over a century, I have lived in secret.
		한 세기를 걸쳐
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	Until now.
		여태까지
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	I know the risk,
		무릅쓸 위험은 알지만
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	but I have to know her.
		그녀를 알아야 한다
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
		엘레나 말이야
		캐더린과 똑닮았더군
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:10	What happened to your face?
		얼굴이 왜 그래?
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	It's nothing.
		아무것도 아냐
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	It didn't look like nothing.
		아무것도 아닌거 같지 않은데
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	Matty tells me you broke his heart.
		매티가 그러길
		네가 우리 아들을 찼다던데
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	- Mom. - He found his rebound girl.
		- 엄마
		- 새 여자를 찾았지
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	There's a tomb underneath the church.
		교회 아래에
		무덤이 있어
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	You saved everyone in the church?
		교회에 있던
		모두를 살려낸거야?
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	27 vampires, Damon.
		뱀파이어 27명이야, 데이먼
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	You can't just bring them back.
		쉽게 불러낼 순 없다구
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:33	It's Harper.
		하퍼입니다
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	I'm glad you found us.
		찾아줘서 고맙네
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	Annabelle, close the door, please.
		애나벨, 문 닫거라

00:00:59	Hey. Bouffin.
		보핀
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:03	What are you guys watching?
		뭐 보고 있어요?
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:07	You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
		같은 걸 계속 보고 있군요?
00:01:09	There are over 150 channels. It's called a remote control.
		 
		채널만 150개가 넘어요
		이건 리모콘이라고 부르죠
00:01:13	 
		 
00:01:13	This button changes the channel.
		버튼을 누르면
		채널이 바뀌어요
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	Hold it like this.
		이렇게 잡아요
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:33	Hmm.
		 
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	Did you get enough, sweetheart?
		충분해요, 자기?
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:36	For now.
		지금은
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	Anna, are you hungry?
		애나, 배고프니?
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	Do you want a little?
		좀 마실래?
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	No. Thank you, Miss Givens.
		됐어요. 기븐스씨
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:43	Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
		좀 누워서 쉬시는게 어때요?
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:45	She's fine.
		괜찮아
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:47	Aren't you, Miss Givens?
		그렇죠, 기븐스양?
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:50	Of course, I am.
		물론 괜찮죠
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:52	I'm fine.
		멀쩡해요
00:01:54

		The Vampire Diaries 1x16
		There Goes the Neighborhood?
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:11	Hey, mom.
		엄마
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:16	Mom.
		엄마
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:21	Hey, mom.
		엄마
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:26	What? I'm trying to sleep.
		잠 좀 자려고 했는데
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:28	Uh, I was just making sure you were alive.
		살아있나 확인했어요
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	I'm sorry, sweetie,
		미안하다, 얘야
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:33	it was a late night.
		늦게 자서
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:34	My head is throbbing.
		머리가 띵하구나
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:36	Yeah,
		네
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:37	I'd appreciate it
		파티를 집에까지
		데려오지 않았음 좋겠어요
00:02:38	 
		파티를 집에까지
		데려오지 않았음 좋겠어요
00:02:38	if you wouldn't bring the party home.
		파티를 집에까지
		데려오지 않았음 좋겠어요
00:02:40	 
		 
00:02:40	And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it, too.
		이웃들도 그걸 바랄거구요
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:43	It wasn't a party. It was one guy.
		파티가 아녔어
		한 남자였지
00:02:44	 
		 
00:02:45	Don't be so judgey.
		비난하지 말거라
00:02:46	 
		 
00:02:46	Yeah, well I talked to Roberta at the grill
		그렇죠, 그릴 레스토랑
		사장 로베르타씨와 얘기했는데
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:49	and there's still a bartending position open.
		아직도 바텐더를
		구하고 있대요
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:53	If you, uh, wanted to get a job.
		일자리 구하고
		싶으시면 말이죠
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:55	Well, I figured she'd still be pissed
		내가 마지막으로 일한 날
		그 일 가지고 열받은걸로 아는데
00:02:57	 
		내가 마지막으로 일한 날
		그 일 가지고 열받은걸로 아는데
00:02:57	about the last time I work there.
		내가 마지막으로 일한 날
		그 일 가지고 열받은걸로 아는데
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:59	I think she's desperate.
		엄마를 채용하고 싶어
		간절하신 거 같아요
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	I'll check it out.
		가서 확인해 보마
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	Yeah?
		네?
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	Don't act so surprised.
		놀란 척 하지 마
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	Well, I mean, I just...
		단지..
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	I didn't know how long
		집에 오래 지내실지 어쩔지
		몰라서 말이죠
00:03:08	 
		집에 오래 지내실지 어쩔지
		몰라서 말이죠
00:03:08	you planned on sticking around.
		집에 오래 지내실지 어쩔지
		몰라서 말이죠
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	Well，there's back grant due.
		보조금도 만기가 됐겠다
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	It's back in everything, mom.
		모든게 제자리로 돌아왔어요
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	I guess, then, I'll check it out.
		그럼 확인해보마
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:17	Who's that?
		누구지?
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	That's Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:03:19	 
		 
00:03:19	Ecch.
		 
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	Easy.
		진정하세요
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:22	Yeah, come in.
		들어와
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:31	Hi, Mrs. Donovan.
		안녕하세요, 어머님
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:36	I, uh, ok, well, 
		난..
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	we're gonna be late,
		늦을 거 같아
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	So, let's just get going.
		어서 가보자
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	Yeah.
		그래
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	Hi. How are you?
		잘 지냈어?
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	Good.
		응
00:03:44	 
		 
00:03:44	Damon hasn't said a word to me.
		데이먼은 아직
		나한테 한마디도 안했어
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	Every time I try to talk to him,
		내가 얘기를 하려고 하면
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	- He shuts me down. - Do you think
		- 가로 막거든
		- 혹시
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	He's still trying to find Katherine?
		아직도 캐더린을
		찾는 중일까?
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:50	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	He waited 145 years,
		145년을 기다렸는데
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:53	only to find out that Katherine could not care less.
		알고보니 캐더린은
		전혀 신경도 안썼지
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:56	I mean, that's gotta hurt, right?
		상처가 클거야
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
		착한 남자한텐
		그런 일이 없을텐데
00:03:59	 
		 
00:04:00	You have every reason to be upset with him.
		네가 데이먼에게
		열 받을 만도 해
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	- Mm-hmm. - Have you thought any more
		- 그럼
		- 너 혹시
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	about what you're going to do?
		뭘 할지 생각해봤어?
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:04	About what?
		어떤거?
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	Isabel, my vampire birth mother,
		내 뱀파이어가 된 생모
		이자벨이
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	who's related to my vampire ancestor Katherine,
		내 뱀파이어 조상인
		캐더린과 연관 있는데
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:09	who screwed over your vampire brother?
		캐더린은 네 뱀파이어 형한테
		뒤통수 쳤단거?
00:04:11	 
		 
00:04:11	Nah. Haven't thought about it at all.
		아니, 그 생각
		전혀 안해봤지
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:13	I'm sorry I brought it up.
		그 얘기 꺼내서 미안해
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:15	It'd just be nice
		그런 일 대면 않고 하루를
		넘길 수 있음 좋겠어
00:04:16	 
		그런 일 대면 않고 하루를
		넘길 수 있음 좋겠어
00:04:16	if we could get through one day
		그런 일 대면 않고 하루를
		넘길 수 있음 좋겠어
00:04:17	 
		그런 일 대면 않고 하루를
		넘길 수 있음 좋겠어
00:04:17	without having to deal with any of it.
		그런 일 대면 않고 하루를
		넘길 수 있음 좋겠어
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	No vampire mother or brother.
		뱀파이어 엄마나
		뱀파이어 형제 얘기 말야
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:21	No vampires at all?
		뱀파이어는 아예
		꼴보기 싫다구?
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:24	No vampires but you.
		너만 빼고
00:04:25	 
		 
00:04:25	I just want to get us back to normal stuff
		난 평범한 일상들로
		돌아가고 싶어
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	like school.
		학교나
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	And homework.
		숙제나
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	And here's a thought.
		하나 생각이 났어
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:32	Fun.
		재미
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	Ooh, that sounds good to me.
		좋은 생각인데
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	When do we start?
		언제 시작하지?
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:38	We can watch a movie at my place.
		우리 집에서
		영화봐도 돼
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	Uh, with your mom?
		너희 엄마랑?
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:42	And a 6-pack?
		술병하고?
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	You know, you don't really help the situation.
		정말 내 상황을
		도와주지 않는구나
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	You could at least try to be nice.
		최소한 친절하게 대할 순 없어?
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Oh, I'm sorry.
		미안
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:47	It's hard for me to show kindness
		날 미워하는 사람한테
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	to people that hate me.
		친절을 보이기 힘들어서
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:51	I'm not that evolved.
		난 그쪽으로 발달하지 못해서
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:58	So, what movie tonight?
		무슨 영화 보게?
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	Whatever you want to do is fine by me.
		뭘 하고 싶든
		난 괜찮아
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	But I'm late and I gotta go, ok?
		근데 늦어서
		가봐야 겠다
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Ok.
		알았어
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:11	And the keypad is for texting,
		키패드는 문자를 쓰는데 필요해
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.
		직접 말하고 싶지 않을때
		문자를 보내지
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	Anna, it's Jeremy,
		애나, 제레미야
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	I haven't heard from you for a while.
		정말 오랫만이다
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	I'm not stalking you. 
		스토킹하는 거 아냐
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:23	Have a good day. I am...
		좋은 하루 보내, 난..
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	I didn't break it, I swear.
		내가 부러뜨린거 아닙니다
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	I was just showing Harper what you taught me.
		네가 가르쳐준걸
		하퍼한테 보여주고 있다
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:27	What a marvelous device.
		정말 굉장한 기계지
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	Who was that?
		누구죠?
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	Jeremy Gilbert.
		제레미 길버트요
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:32	Is that your boyfriend?
		남자친구인가요?
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	Of course not.
		물론 아니지
00:05:34	 
		 
00:05:37	Uh, what do you think?
		내 옷 어떻니?
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	You're very respectable.
		훌륭하신데요
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	That's the goal.
		그게 내 목표야
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	I can't say that I miss corsets.
		코르셋은 그립지 않더군
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys
		수지가 차 열쇠를 줬어요
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	- and her ATM card. - What's that?
		- 신용카드도요
		- 그게 뭐지?
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:47	I'll explain later.
		나중에 설명할게요
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:50	Where are you going?
		어디 가요?
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	We have some business in town.
		마을에 처리할 일이 있어서
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	We'll be back as soon as we can.
		곧 돌아올거네
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	I trust that you'll keep an eye on things.
		자네가 우리집을
		지키리라 믿네
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	So, I'm the babysitter now.
		이제 난 베이비시터가 됐군요
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Frederick.
		프레드릭
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	If this is going to work,
		이 일을 잘 해내려면
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	we have to cooperate with one another.
		서로 협력해야 하네
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	So you say.
		그렇겠죠
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	I'll watch things, Miss Pearl.
		제가 지켜보겠습니다, 펄 양
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	Thank you, Harper.
		고맙네, 하퍼군
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:14	I'm thinking nothing huge,
		큰건 아니라
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	just dinner at the grill,
		그냥 그릴 레스토랑에서
		식사하고
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	Maybe late movie.
		영화도 보는거야
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:19	You mean like a double date?
		더블 데이트처럼?
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:20	2 pair out on a friday night,
		두 쌍의 커플이
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Coupled.
		금요일밤에 외출한다
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:23	Yeah, a double date.
		더블 데이트 맞지
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	Do you think that's a good idea?
		좋은 생각 같아?
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	Why not?
		안될거 뭐있어?
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	You know, we all haven't gone out together before
		우린 같이 데이트한적 없잖아
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us.
		우리 모두가
		불편하지 않길 바라
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	Like, the couple dynamics have changed,
		짝이 바뀌었지만
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	and there's been a little awkwardness
		약간 어색했잖아
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	between you, Matt and me,
		너랑 맷 말야
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	and I just think it's important
		훌훌 털어 버리는게
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	that we get over it.
		좋을 것 같아
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	- I don't know. - You know wha...
		- 모르겠어
		- 있지
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:43	I... I think that sounds like a great idea.
		괜찮은 생각 같아
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:47	- You do? - Yeah.
		- 그래?
		- 응
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	Yeah, a nice evening out with friends.
		친구랑 함께하는
		멋진 저녁
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	Sounds fun.
		재미있겠는데
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	As in fun.
		정말로
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	Hmm?
		 
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	A double date it is.
		더블 데이트 하자
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	Ok.
		좋아
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	So, we will see you tonight.
		오늘 저녁때 보자
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	- Ok. - Ok.
		- 괜찮아
		- 응
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:07	Ok.
		그래
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:26	Hello, Damon.
		안녕, 데이먼
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:30	Ever hear of knocking?
		노크란 단어는
		못들어보셨어요?
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	An invitation wasn't necessary.
		초대받을 필요 없지
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	I'm surprised that no living person resides here.
		산 사람은 이곳에
		살지 않는다니 놀라운데
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	Is it just you and your brother?
		자네와 자네 동생만
		지내는 건가?
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:41	Yeah.
		맞아요
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	But he keeped out all walking vampires.
		하지만 뱀파이어들은
		들이질 않더군요
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	Killed 'em.
		다 죽였지
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:48	Unh!
		 
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:51	Damn!
		젠장!
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:55	Have a seat, Damon.
		거기 앉게
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:59	I was hoping we could have a word.
		얘기 좀 하고 싶었는데
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:03	Sure.
		물론요
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:12	
		어떻게 뱀파이어가 되죠?
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:15	
		브래드 피트가
		만들어 줬어
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	
		라스베가스 가봐
		웨인 뉴튼을 찾아
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:23	
		어떻게 뱀파이어를 죽이죠?
00:08:24	
		 
		폴라 압둘의 피로
		(아메리칸 아이돌 심판이자 과거 가수)
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:26	Freak.
		웃기는 놈
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:32	
		진지한 대답을
		해주세요, 제발
00:08:33	
		 
		가슴에 말뚝 박는게
		늘 효과 있지
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:38	
		뱀파이어의 존재를 믿나요?
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:40	
		너도 안그래?
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:44	We've taken up residence
		우린 교외의
		농가 주택에서
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	at a farm house just outside of town.
		머물고 있다네
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	It'll suffice for now.
		같이 살기 충분하지
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	All 25 vampires?
		뱀파이어 25명씩이나요?
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	Not all. Some.
		다는 아니고
		일부만
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	I imagine that a few have already left town.
		벌써 몇은
		동네를 떠난거 같고
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Others are probably still in the woods
		다른 뱀파이어들은
		아마 숲속에 있을거야
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	or, like us, acclimating.
		우리처럼
		새 환경에 적응중이겠지
00:08:58	 
		 
00:09:00	How'd they get out of the tomb?
		어떻게 무덤을 벗어났죠?
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	I think the woods screwed up
		우리가 부린 요술이
		엉망이 된거 같아
00:09:02	 
		우리가 부린 요술이
		엉망이 된거 같아
00:09:02	that part of our hocus-pocus.
		우리가 부린 요술이
		엉망이 된거 같아
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	Ohh.
		 
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	I understand from Anna
		애나한테 들었는데
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	that the founding families still have a secret council?
		설립자 가족들끼리
		아직도 비밀의회가 연다고?
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	And you're a part of it.
		너도 일원이고
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	That's ridiculous.
		말도 안돼
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet, Damon.
		난 혜성이 떨어진 후로
		계속 미스틱 폴스에서 살았어
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	I'm up to speed.
		다 알고 있다구
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	So am I.
		나도 그렇네
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	And now that you've infiltrated the council,
		자네가 의회에 침투한 이상
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	I'll need to know everything they know.
		그들이 아는걸
		모두 알아야 하네
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	Starting with a list of names
		명단부터 시작해
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	of all the council members and their families.
		의회 회원과 가족들 말이네
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	And everyone you've supplied with vervain.
		마편초를 공급받은 사람 이름도
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	Yes, that will have to stop immediately.
		그래, 그것도
		즉각 멈춰야 할거야
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	What exactly are you trying to achieve?
		대체 어떤 목적을
		이루려는 거죠?
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:30	Mystic Falls is our home, Damon.
		미스틱 폴스는
		우리 고향이야
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	They took that from us.
		그들이 우리한테서 뺏어갔지
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	Our land, our home.
		우리 땅과
		우리 집을
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	It's time we rebuild.
		다시 건설할 차례야
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	What, are you crazy?
		정신 나갔어요?
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	That was 1864.
		그건 1864년도 일이라구요
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	Wake up, woman.
		정신 좀 차리세요
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	The world has moved on.
		세상은 이미 바뀌었어요
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	As a reward for your help,
		도움의 댓가로
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	I'm willing to give you what you want most.
		자네가 제일 원하는 걸
		가져다 줄 의향이 있네
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	I want nothing.
		난 원하는거 없어요
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	Katherine.
		캐더린 말야
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:52	You wouldn't even know where she was.
		당신은 그녀가
		어디 있는지도 몰랐잖아요
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	You've been under the ground
		당신은 땅 밑에
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	for the last 1 1/2 centuries.
		150년간 갇혀 있었죠
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	Katherine and I were best friends
		캐더린과 난
		단짝 친구였어
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	long before we came to Mystic Falls, Damon.
		미스틱 폴스로
		오기 훨씬 전부터
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:02	I know how she thinks.
		캐더린이
		어떤 생각을 하는지 알지
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	I know her patterns.
		그녀의 성격 패턴도 알고
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:05	I know where to find her.
		어디서 찾아야 할지 아네
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:10	I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again.
		난 캐더린을 다시 보고 싶은
		욕구가 전혀 없어요
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	And there's no way in hell
		절대로
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.
		당신의 앞잡이 역할도
		하기 싫구요
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	I'm not asking for your help, Damon.
		난 자네에게 도움을
		요청하는게 아냐
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:22	Finding Katherine
		캐더린을 찾는건
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	was just a mere gesture of kindness.
		단지 친절의 표시일 뿐야
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	The rest is non-negotiable.
		나머지는 협상이 불가능해
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:29	Aah!
		 
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:35	Unh! Aah!
		 
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	I have 400 years on you, little boy.
		난 자네 때문에
		400년을 허비했어
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	I'll rip you from limb to limb
		눈깜박 안하고
		사지를 하나하나
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	without even blinking and you know it.
		찢을 수 있단건
		자네도 알잖나
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	I'll be in touch.
		나중에 연락하겠네
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:56	You got me flowers.
		꽃을 사왔네
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	Well, I figured it's a date,
		데이트니까
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Why not do right?
		올바르게 해야지
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	Aww.
		 
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	I would have driven, too,
		운전도 하고 싶었는데
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	But you're the one with the car.
		너한테 차가 있으니
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:07	You know, you'd think that for someone who was around
		자동차가 발명된 시대부터
		살아온 사람이 있다면
00:11:10	 
		자동차가 발명된 시대부터
		살아온 사람이 있다면
00:11:10	when the car was invented,
		자동차가 발명된 시대부터
		살아온 사람이 있다면
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	that you'd have one.
		당연히 차를
		가질줄 알았는데
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	Oh, I have one.
		사실 하나 있어
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	I just never drive it.
		운전은 안해봤을 뿐이지
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:18	You know, it's not too late to cancel.
		취소하긴 안 늦었어
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:20	Why would we do that?
		왜 취소하려고?
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	It just seems surreal.
		실감이 안나서
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:27	Like maybe we weren't meant
		그러니까 우리는
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	to get to the normal part.
		평범한 일상을 누릴
		운명이 아닌거 같아서
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	That's exactly why we're going to do it.
		그래서 이러겠단 거야
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	We're going to go out,
		우린 나가서
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	have some fun,
		즐거운 시간을 보내고
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious.
		심각할 필요 없단걸
		기억하는 거야
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:39	Listen, when I decided to stay here
		여기서 살기로 결정하고
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	and to get to know you,
		널 알기로 결정했던건
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	it was so that I could do things like this.
		이런 평범한 일을
		하고 싶어서 였어
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	I could bring my girlfriend flowers,
		내 여자친구에게
		꽃다발도 주고
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:48	take her out on a date,
		데이트도 데려가고
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	try to be normal.
		평범한 하루를
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:53	Have you ever even been on a double date before?
		더블 데이트 해본 적 있어?
00:11:56	 
		 
00:11:57	Oh, absolutely.
		당연하지
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	Um, 72. Heff and the twins.
		72년도에
		헤프랑 쌍둥이랑
		(휴 헤프너: 플레이보이 창간자)
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	What?
		뭐라고?
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	Yeah. Playmates. I gotta miss June.
		그래, 플레이메이트
		미스 6월이 그립네
		(플레이메이트: 플레이보이 모델)
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	Are you serious?
		진짜야?
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:07	Miss Summers?
		섬머스양?
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	Yes. Hi, Pearl.
		안녕하세요, 펄
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	Hi. This is my daughter Annabelle.
		제 딸 애나벨이에요
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	Of course. Jeremy's friend.
		알아요
		제레미 친구죠
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	Nice to see you, Miss Sommers.
		만나서 반가워요, 소머스양
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	Oh, Jenna, please.
		제나라고 불러줘요
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	This property was in
		이 곳은
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	my brother-in-law's family for generations.
		제 처남 가정이
		몇세대간 소유했던 곳이에요
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	It's one of the original structures in Mystic Falls.
		미스틱 폴즈의
		최초 건축물 중 하나죠
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	Used to be one of those old-fashioned drug store thingies.
		오래된 약국 같은걸
		운영하던 곳인대
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	You mean an apothecary?
		약방 말인가요?
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	- Yeah. - You don't say.
		- 네
		- 신기하군요
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	Sorry, if it's musty.
		곰팡내 나도 이해해주세요
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	No one's been in here for quite some time.
		오랫동안 아무도
		안 왔던 곳이거든요
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	I'll use my imagination.
		상상이 되네요
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	Annabelle.
		애나벨
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	Coming, mother.
		가요, 엄마
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:52	What's with the glasses inside?
		실내에서 왜
		썬글라스를 쓰죠?
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	My, uh,
		제...
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	ah, my eyes are a little sensitive today.
		제 눈이 오늘따라
		에민해서요
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:58	You're new around here.
		이 동네서 처음 보는데
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:01	Oh, in the country, I'm very old.
		생각과 반대로
		꽤 나이 먹었답니다
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	Bourbon neat.
		버본 위스키로 주세요
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:04	I haven't been gone that long.
		난 이곳을 떠났다
		금방 돌아왔어요
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	I would remember someone who looked like you.
		그쪽같이 생긴 사람은
		당연히 기억할거에요
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	Yeah? Where'd you go?
		그래요?
		어디 계셨는데요?
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	Around, about.
		여기 저기요
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Been there.
		저도 경험이 있죠
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	I love to see a man drown his sorrows.
		슬픔에 빠져있는
		남자는 늘 맘에 들죠
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	It's so sexy.
		참 섹시하거든요
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	It's more like nursing my wounds.
		그것보단 제 상처를
		치유하는 중이죠
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	And you?
		그쪽은?
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	I was supposed to be interviewing for the bartender job,
		바텐더 일 구하러
		면접봐야 하는데
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	But, um, I think the manager blew me off.
		매니저가 바람맞춘거 같네요
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	Well, that's not very nice.
		그거 참 나쁜데요
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Yeah. Last time I was in town,
		그렇죠
		마지막으로 여기서 머물때
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	I slept with her boyfriend.
		매니저 남자친구랑
		같이 잤거든요
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	Well, that's not very nice, either.
		그것도 나쁜짓이구요
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	- But it happens. - Yes, it does.
		- 생길때도 있으니
		- 그렇죠
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	Kelly?
		켈리?
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Kelly Donovan.
		켈리 도노반
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	Jen!
		젠!
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:42	I heard you were back in town
		다시 돌아오셨다 들었어요
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:44	You used to babysit me
		애기때 절 돌봐주시고
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	And then, I used to party with her.
		그러다가 나중에
		같이 파티를 했죠
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	This woman was crazy.
		정말 과격한 여자분이세요
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	Not as crazy as you.
		자네만큼은 아니지
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	Ha, not anymore.
		더이상은 아니죠
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	Well, sit, drink.
		앉아서 마시게
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	Uh, I shouldn't.
		그럼 안되요
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:55	I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?
		책임있는 성인 된거
		못 들으셨어요?
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:57	Then take a night off. It's good for the soul.
		그럼 하루만 쉬어
		도움이 될거야
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	Great for the soul.
		아주 큰 도움이 되죠
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:03	Oh, well.
		그럼
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	This is not gonna end well.
		안 좋게 끝날텐데
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	Can't wait.
		기대되는걸요
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:08	Whoo!
		 
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:13	- I hate this house. - This is better than the tomb.
		- 이 집 맘에 안들어
		- 무덤보단 낫잖아
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	I didn't stay locked up until 145 years
		145년간 갇혀있다가
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	then end up locked up here.
		결국 여기 갇혀있을 줄 몰랐다구
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	Maybe you should quit complaining.
		불평은 그만하시죠
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:29	You gonna stop me?
		날 말릴건가?
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	Let it be, Frederick.
		내버려둬, 프레드릭
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	You heard what Pearl said.
		펄 얘기 들었잖아
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	I don't care what Pearl said.
		펄이 뭐래든 상관 없어
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:37	What you got, boy?
		한판 해보겠단 건가?
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:44	Try that again.
		다시 해봐
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:48	Back off.
		물러나
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	Back off.
		물러나라구
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	We don't fight each other. Those are the rules.
		서로 싸우지 않는다
		우리의 규율이었잖나
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	And I'm tired of your rules.
		난 당신 규율이 신물나
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	I want out of this house.
		난 이 집을 나가고 싶다고
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	Why can't we go in town?
		왜 마을로 나갈 수 없지?
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	Eventually.
		나중에 보내줄 거네
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	But for now, we have to keep a low profile.
		하지만 지금은
		조용히 있어야 해
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	No one knows who I am.
		아무도 내가 누군지 몰라
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	The Salvatore brothers do.
		살바토어 형제들은 아네
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	And I wish hell I could run into them.
		그들과 마주쳤음 좋겠네
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	They're the reason we were caught in the first place.
		우리가 애초에 잡혔던 것도
		그 놈들 때문이니깐
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:07	So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?
		맷, 여기서
		일하는거 어때?
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:11	Uh, it's not that bad.
		나쁘진 않아
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	Wait staff comes out pretty good.
		다들 좋은 곳으로 취직하고
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	You know, they can't keep a bartender to save their lives.
		먹고 살려면 평생
		바텐더 일만 할 순 없잖아
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	I actually put my mom up for the job.
		엄마한테 일자리 추천도 했지
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	How's that been
		어머니는 어떠셔?
00:15:22	 
		어머니는 어떠셔?
00:15:22	having Kelly back?
		어머니는 어떠셔?
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	You know, the same old Kelly.
		똑같으시지
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:24	She's, uh, she's trying, sort of.
		노력 중이긴 하지만
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.
		켈리씨와 우리 엄마는
		어릴때 단짝 친구셨어
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	That's how Matt and I first met.
		맷하고 내가
		그렇게 처음 만났지
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	Shared a crib together.
		같은 아기 침대에 재웠지
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	You're kidding.
		농담 아냐
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:33	No, we've, uh, known each other our whole lives.
		아니, 우린
		평생 알고 지냈어
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:40	Ok.
		좋아
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:43	Whoo!
		 
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	You gotta be kidding me.
		이런
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:46	Oh my god. It's big Jenna now.
		 
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:56	Where are you going?
		어디 가세요?
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.
		베타니랑 난
		잠깐 외출 좀 하려고
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:01	Hit the town. Kick up our heels.
		동네도 둘러볼겸
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	But we're not supposed to leave.
		나가면 안되잖습니까
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	Miss Pearl made that very clear.
		펄 양이 확실하게
		말씀해 주셨는데요
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:09	You gonna stop me?
		날 멈출건가?
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:11	I didn't think so.
		글쎄
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:28	- Anna. - Surprised?
		- 애나
		- 놀랐지?
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	I, uh, I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
		너희 엄마랑 같이
		이사가는 줄 알았는데
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	Oh, change of plans.
		계획이 바뀌었어
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:40	I'm sorry. I thought you'd be psyched.
		미안. 네가
		기뻐할 줄 알았는데
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	No! No, no, I mean, I am.
		아니, 정말 기뻐
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	Of course I am.
		물론이지
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:48	All right, then.
		좋아
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	Step aside.
		들어갈게
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:59	Don't be grumpy.
		까다롭게 굴지 마요
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	It can't be that bad.
		그리 나쁜 건 아닐텐데
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	You'd be surprised.
		놀랄거에요
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	My primary reason for existence has abandoned me
		제 존재의 이유가
		날 버렸어요
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	and, after today's events,
		오늘 일 후에
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	the remains of the shaky ground that I walk on
		제가 서 있는
		이 비틀대는 토대의 흔적은
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	are about to go kaboom.
		곧 파멸을 맞을거에요
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:17	Let's get hammered.
		취해 봅시다
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	Let's.
		그래요
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:24	Whoo!
		 
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:25	At least they're having fun.
		최소한 저쪽에선
		즐거워 하네
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:28	They're drunk.
		취했잖아
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	Remember when Elena's parents busted us here
		엘레나 부모님이
		여기 있는거 발각한거 기억나?
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	after homecoming?
		동창회 후로
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	Oh, my god, yes!
		당연하지!
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	We were wasted.
		우린 취해 있었지
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	It was the first time I ever got drunk.
		그때 처음으로 취했지
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	I blame Matt.
		맷 탓이야
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	Her parents got seated at the next booth.
		엘레나 부모님이
		옆 좌석에 앉으셨지
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	Oh, and Matt had me pretend that I was choking
		맷이 시켜서
		난 질식한 연기를 했어
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	so we could get away.
		벌은 면하려고
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	Except her dad was a doctor,
		하지만 아버지가 의사셔서
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	so, he jumped up to save her.
		일어나 엘레나를
		구하려고 했지
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	And I ran and slipped on the wet floor
		도망치다가
		젖은 바닥에 미끄러져서
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	and bit it.
		실패했지
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	In front of everyone.
		모두가 보는 앞에서
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	Do you remember that?
		기억나?
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	3 stitches, a hangover for days,
		3바늘 꼬매고
		며칠간 숙취로 고생하고
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week.
		이 애를 못 만나게 하려고
		일주일간 외출금지였지
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:59	Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom.
		화장실 좀 갈게
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:04	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	Quick, hide.
		빨리 숨어요
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	We're not here.
		여기 없는 거에요
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	Why? Where'd we go?
		왜요?
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	Children under our care at 5:00 p.m.
		우리가 돌보는 아이들이
		5시 방향에 있어요
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:12	This is not role modelish.
		롤모델답지 않은 짓이라구요
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:16	Kelly, damn.
		켈리, 젠장
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	Ohh!
		 
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	Ok, so, uh, what made you and your mom
		너랑 너희 엄마가
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	decide to stay in town?
		어쩌다 계속
		여기서 지내기로 했어?
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:23	Oh, she got this business opportunity.
		사업 기회가 생기셔서
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	She's gonna open up a little store.
		작은 가게를 여실거야
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	It's always been her dream.
		늘 그분 꿈이였지
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	So, yeah, we're staying.
		그래서 안 떠나게 됐어
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:30	And I'm thinking about going back to highschool.
		다시 고등학교도 다닐까
		생각 중이야
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	So, you'll be seeing a lot more of me.
		날 더 많이 보게 될거야
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	Oh, yeah?
		그래?
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	Enough of home schooling.
		홈스쿨링도 지겨워
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	You know? I'd like to be a normal teen for once.
		난 한번만 이라도
		평범한 10대가 되고 싶어
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	But I have to ask my mom first.
		우선 엄마한테
		물어봐야 해
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	She'll have an opinion.
		의견이 다르셔서
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	Yeah, well, I wish you were there now.
		너도 학교에 있었음 좋겠을 텐데
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	I actually have to write another paper.
		다른 과제가 생겼거든
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	I was thinking about squeezing one more out
		미스틱 폴스의
		뱀파이어를 주제로
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	on the vampires of Mystic Falls.
		다른걸 쓸까 생각중이야
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:49	Really?
		진짜?
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	Haven't you exhausted the subject?
		그 얘기는 다 쓰지 않았나?
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	No. No, I want to go deeper, you know?
		아니, 더 깊이 파고 싶어
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	I want to understand why people were labeled as vampires
		나는 왜 오래전에
		뱀파이어라는 꼬리표를 붙였는지
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	back in the day.
		알고 싶어
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	I mean, maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
		진짜 뱀파이어란 게
		있었을 지 몰라
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	They're just different from the way we always thought they were.
		우리가 생각했던 것과
		다른 방식으로
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	What do you mean?
		그게 무슨 말이야?
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:05	Well, uh,
		그러니까
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	Maybe they're normal and good,
		평범하고 착한 존재지만
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	just outsiders, you know?
		아웃사이더일 뿐이라고
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	Um, misunderstood.
		이해받지 못하고
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:15	You're kidding, right?
		농담하는 거지?
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	Don't you think it could be possible?
		가능할거라 안 믿니?
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	You did give me all that info.
		네가 모든 정보를 줬잖아
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Jeremy, I made it up, ok?
		제레미, 다 내가 지어낸 얘기였어
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	I mean, you were all cute and fluffy
		네가 귀엽고 바보스럽길래
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:29	and I wanted to make a good impression.
		좋은 인상을
		남기고 싶었거든
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:36	Is there anything you're not good at?
		못하는게 없구나?
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	Double dating.
		더블 데이트
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	This is all kinda new to me.
		나한텐 색다른 거라
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	I usually keep to myself.
		늘 혼자서만 지냈거든
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	I don't always fit in.
		늘 어디든 속하질 못했지
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	That's because you're that guy.
		넌 그런 남자니까
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	What guy?
		어떤 남자?
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:51	The guy who seems like he has everything.
		모든걸 다 가진듯 보이는 남자
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	So, the people who don't kinda run the other way.
		그래서 부족한 사람들은
		방해하지 않으려 하지
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:58	Is that what I seem like?
		그렇게 보여?
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Pretty much.
		거의
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	Hmm.
		 
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	What a dick.
		정말 나쁜 놈이네
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	Yeah.
		그래
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	Yeah.
		응
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:13	So, um,
		그럼
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	What are you doing?
		뭐 하는 거야?
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	What?
		뭘?
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	Well, the point of this
		데이트를 하는 이유가
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	was to show him how much you care about Stefan.
		스테판을 얼마나 좋아하는지
		보여주려는 거였잖아
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	You're not to hopscotch down memory lane.
		추억에 잠기는게 아니라
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	I was just trying to make conversation.
		난 대화를 하려는 것 뿐이었어
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	Well, try less.
		그럼 줄여
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:32	Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:36	Katherine.

		아니, 전혀 익숙치 않은 얼굴이야
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	There wasn't at all.
		한번도 못봤어
00:21:40

00:21:43	You know, the whole point of tonight
		오늘 밤의 요지는
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	was to not have to deal with this stuff.
		이런 일을 대면하지
		않으려는 거였어
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	We need to get through one night.
		하루만이라도 그냥

00:21:58	But I don't know what else to do.
		달리 할 방법을 모르겠어
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	Look, if there's another vampire in town,
		이 동네에
		뱀파이어가 또 있다면
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	he'll still be here tomorrow.
		내일도 여기 있을거야
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	We'll deal with it tomorrow.

		좀 지나치지
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice.
		우리 집 두배는 될걸
00:22:40

00:22:52	just a little hobby of mine.
		내 작은 취미야
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9.
		9살때 머스탱 시리즈

		운전 안하는 거야?
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:49	Well, it, uh, doesn't run.
		작동이 안돼
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	I mean, it's not that I could figure out.
		내가 쉽게 고칠수 있는것도 아니고
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
		시동이 안켜지는 차를

00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:03	Of course.

		키스하기 힘들거든

		같이 있던 분
		데이먼 살바토어인가요?

		할지 보는 시험이었잖아
00:30:00	to see how I would do around Elena.
		내가 엘레나 근처에서 어떤 행동을
		할지 보는 시험이었잖아
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:07	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	You were eminiscing
		너는 오늘 밤 내내
		엘레나와의 추억에 잠겼으니
00:30:11	 
		너는 오늘 밤 내내
		엘레나와의 추억에 잠겼으니
00:30:11	about the Elena years all night.
		너는 오늘 밤 내내
		엘레나와의 추억에 잠겼으니
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:15	Caroline,
		캐롤라인
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:16	that stuff came before, ok?
		그건 이전 일이야
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:17	It's not just gonna go away.
		사라지지 않을거라구
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	I know that, ok?
		알아
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	No. No, you don't.
		아니, 몰라
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:22	Because you're letting it turn you into a crazy person.
		넌 미친 사람처럼
		돌변하려고 해
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:28	Look, it's my fault.
		내 잘못이야
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	I, you know, I made it pretty clear early on
		확실히 보여줬지
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:32	that Elena still means something to me.
		엘레나가 아직도
		의미가 있단걸
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	But all that talk,
		하지만 모든 대화는
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	that was just
		그저
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	2 old friends and some memories.
		옛 친구 둘의
		추억 얘기였어
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:45	Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.
		오늘밤은 나와 엘레나를 위한
		밤이 아녔어
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	I was there
		난 거기 갔어
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	because I wanted to be with you.
		너랑 같이 있고 싶어서
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:53	And I don't know what this means
		난 이 의미가 뭔지 모르겠고
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	or what we are,
		우리 사이가 뭔지 모르겠지만
00:30:58	 
		 
00:30:58	but I do know that you're the only person
		내가 아는건
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	I want to be in this car with right now.
		난 너하고만 이 차에 있고 싶어
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:04	I don't even know if this makes sense,
		이해가 되는지 모르지만
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	because I'm not really that good at expressing myself.
		난 표현을 잘 못하거든
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	No, no.
		아니
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:13	I think you're doing just fine.
		잘하고 있어
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:35	Ow!
		 
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:38	Sports cars. 
		스포츠카란
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	- Yeah. - Hmm.
		- 그래
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:43	Kelly, well.
		켈리
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:52	Now that you've got me here.
		여기도 데려 왔겠다
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:55	What are you gonna do with me?
		뭘 하고 싶죠?
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	I'm going to...
		난..
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:01	going to do this.
		이걸 할거에요
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:22	Ohh!
		 
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:28	Mom?
		엄마?
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:30	Damon?
		데이먼
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	Oh, my god. Matt.
		세상에, 맷
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	Oh, my god.
		이럴수가
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:44	- I gotta... - It's fine. Just go.
		- 난 그럼...
		- 괜찮아요, 그냥 가요
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:47	I... I'll take her home.
		집에 데려다 줄게
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:50	Thanks, man.
		고마웠어
00:32:51	 
		 
00:33:07	Where have you been?
		어디에 있었니?
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	Um, I needed some air.
		바람 좀 쐬고 왔어요
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	For 3 hours?
		3시간 씩이나?
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:14	Tell me. Where have you been?
		말해봐. 어디 있었니?
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	Out.
		밖에요
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:17	I was out.
		밖에 좀 나갔어요
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:18	Annabelle, don't do this.
		애나벨, 이러지 말거라
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	I can't fight you, too.
		너하고도 싸울순 없어
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:27	What?
		무슨 일이니?
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:30	I'm sorry.
		죄송해요
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:41	Sorry I'm bailing.
		도망쳐서 미안
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	Just wish you'd let me drive you home.
		널 집에 데려다주게 해주면 좋을텐데
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	Normal people don't have chaperones or bodyguards
		평범한 사람들은
		보호자나 보디가드나
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:48	or babysitters.
		베이비시터가 필요 없잖아
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	We're normal tonight, remember?
		우린 오늘 평범하게
		지내기로 했잖아. 기억 안나?
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:50	I know, I just get so worried about you.
		그냥 네가 정말 걱정 되서
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	Stefan, I can't live every minute
		스테판, 난 매 순간을
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	afraid that someone's gonna come after me.
		누군가 날 쫓아올거라
		두려워하며 살 순 없어
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:56	I won't.
		안 그럴거야
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:57	That's not living.
		그건 사는게 아니니
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:59	Ok.
		좋아
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	Call me when you get home safe?
		집에 잘 들어가면
		전화 줘
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:02	- Mm... hmm. - Ok.
		- 알았어
		- 좋아
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:10	- Bye, Stefan. - Bye.
		- 잘있어, 스테판
		- 잘가
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:44	Don't look at me like that.
		그런 식으로 쳐다보지 마
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	Are you crazy?
		제 정신이야?
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	Save the lecture. Look...
		훈계는 아껴둬
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:52	Aah!
		 
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:55	
		 
00:35:05	
		 
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:39	Damn it.
		젠장
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	Aah.
		 
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	I remember them.
		저들이 기억나
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:44	From 1864.
		1864년대였지
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	They were in the tomb.
		무덤 안에 갇혀 있었어
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:49	Yeah.
		그래
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:51	About that.
		그거 말인데
00:35:52	 
		 
00:36:01	Matt
		맷
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:06	Matt...
		맷
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	I don't wanna hear it, mom.
		듣고 싶지 않아요, 엄마
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:09	Look.
		보렴
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:12	Matty, please.
		매티, 제발
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	Do you know what I was doing tonight, mom?
		내가 뭘 했는지 알아요?
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:17	I was having fun.
		즐거운 시간을 보냈어요
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	You know, trying to forget
		매일 겪는 엿같은 일들을
		잊어보려구요
00:36:19	 
		매일 겪는 엿같은 일들을
		잊어보려구요
00:36:19	about all the crap that I have to deal with every day?
		매일 겪는 엿같은 일들을
		잊어보려구요
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	Just enjoy a night with my friends.
		그냥 친구들과
		즐거운 저녁을 보냈어요
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:25	And then, there you are.
		그런데 엄마가 거기 계셨죠
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	Wasted at the bar,
		술에 흠뻑 취해서요
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	where I work, by the way.
		제가 일하는 곳에서 말이죠
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:32	To pay the bills that you don't pay.
		엄마가 내지 않는
		생활비 내려고 일하는데서
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:35	And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
		근데 엄마는 또
		애같은 행동을 해요?
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	Hookin' up with some guy half your age.
		나이가 반은 어린
		남자랑 키스하면서 말이죠
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:41	I'm the kid, mom.
		내가 바로 엄마 자식이에요
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	You're supposed to be responsible for me.
		책임감 가지고
		절 키우셔야 한다구요
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:47	I know, Matt.
		나도 안다, 맷
00:36:50	 
		 
00:37:03	How was your night?
		오늘 하루는 어땠니?
00:37:04	 
		 
00:37:05	Oh, same old, as old. You?
		뻔했지. 누나는?
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:08	Yep.
		나도
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:19	So where is Bethanne?
		베타니는 어디있나?
00:37:20	She won't be coming back.
		 
		돌아오지 않을겁니다
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:23	What happened? where is she?
		무슨 일이야?
		어디 있지?
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	Well, you were right.
		당신 말이 맞았어요
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:30	We shouldn't have left.
		집을 나서면 안되는 거였죠
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:33	No.
		그렇지
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:36	You hungry?
		배고픈가?
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:51	Unh!
		 
00:37:53	 
		 
00:38:02	Next time, you'll listen to me.
		다음번엔 내 말을 듣게
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:08	I'm home.
		집에 왔어
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	Teeth brushed, ready for bed.
		이빨 닦고
		잘 준비 다 했어
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	Safe and sound.
		안전하게
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:13	Oh, good. I'm glad.
		좋아. 기쁘다
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	Is everything all right?
		무슨 일 없지?
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:16	You sound serious.
		목소리가 심각해 보인다
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:17	no, no, no.
		아니
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:19	Uh, not tonight.
		오늘은 아무 일 없었어
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:20	You still have a few more minutes left of normal.
		평범하게 지낼 시간
		몇분 더 남았네
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:22	I'll pay you back tomorrow, ok?
		내일 갚아줄게 알았지?
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:24	I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
		오늘 데이트
		정말 즐거웠어
00:38:27	 
		 
00:38:27	Such a liar.
		거짓말쟁이
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	No, I'm serious.
		진심이야
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:31	In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be.
		어찌 보면, 내 기대와
		맞아 떨어졌는걸
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	I had really nice time, too.
		나도 정말 즐거웠어
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:47	Could you help me out a little bit?
		여기 나 좀 도와줄래?
00:38:48	 
		 
00:38:50	What the hell?
		이럴수가
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:52	I could have killed you.
		널 죽일 수도 있었어
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:56	Yeah, but you didn't.
		그렇지만 죽이지 않았지
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	I should have.
		죽였어야 했어
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:01	But you didn't.
		하지만 죽이지 않았지
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	How did you know?
		어떻게 알았어?
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	I knew this girl, Vicki.
		난 비키라는 여자애를 알았어
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	She, uh,
		비키는
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:12	she was attacked by an animal,
		동물의 공격을 당했어
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:14	a bite on the neck.
		목을 물렸지
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	She started acting crazy.
		그후론 이상한 행동을 하는거야
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	You know, weird,
		이상했지
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	and it... and it seemed like drugs,
		그게.. 마약 때문 같았는데
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	but then, you showed me those arties.
		네가 기사들을 보여줬잖아
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:25	And then, I saw your face.
		그리고 네 얼굴을 봤어
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:28	And how it changed.
		변한 모습도 알게됐지
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	That night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
		그날 밤 묘지에서
		너한테 키스했을때 말야
00:39:32	Look.
		 
		봐
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:34	You know you can't tell anyone, right?
		넌 아무한테 말하면 안돼
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	Ha. Who'd believe me?
		누가 날 믿어 주겠어?
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:38	You'd be surprised.
		알면 놀랄걸
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:44	Why didn't you?
		왜 안 그랬어?
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:45	Kill me?
		날 안죽였냐고?
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:49	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:39:51	 
		 
00:39:52	Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
		난 너 같은 남자라면
		사죽을 못쓰나봐
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:55	Like what?
		어떤 남자?
00:39:56	 
		 
00:39:57	Lost.
		길을 잃은 남자
00:39:59	 
		 
00:40:03	Why would you confront me about it? why would you risk it?
		왜 나한테 그걸 들이댄거야?
		왜 그런 위험을 무릅썼냐고?
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	Because if it was true maybe,
		그게 사실이라면
00:40:09	 
		 
00:40:11	maybe it's true about Vicki.
		비키에 관한 일도
		사실이니까
00:40:14	 
		 
00:40:18	And also because...
		그리고 또..
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:22	I want you to turn me.
		날 뱀파이어로 만들어주길 원해
00:40:23
