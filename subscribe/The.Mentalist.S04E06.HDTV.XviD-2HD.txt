00:00:12	Victim's the local chief
		of police... Marnie Green.
		피해자는 이 지역 파출소장, 마니 그린입니다.
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	Shot twice in the chest,
		once in the head.
		가슴에 두발, 머리에 한발 맞았습니다 
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	Trucker found the body,
		called it in just after 5:00.
		트럭 운전사가 시신을 발견해 5시경에 신고했습니다
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	First responder was a, uh,
		officer from her department.
		지서 순경이 신고를 받았답니다
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	Where is he?
		지금 어딨지?
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	Just over here.
		Clarence Price.
		바로 저기요 클래런스 프라이스 순경입니다
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	Agent Lisbon with the CBI.
		My condolences.
		CBI의 리스본 요원입니다 삼가 유감을 표합니다
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	Any idea what the chief was
		doing out here last night?
		지난밤 소장님이 여기서 뭘 하신거죠?
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	No, ma'am.
		Weren't any calls on the radio.
		무전으로 전혀 말씀이 없으셨습니다
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	Does she have family
		around here?
		소장님 가족이 이 근처 사나요?
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	Chief lived alone.
		Worked pretty much 24/7.
		소장님은 독신이셨고 일밖에 모르셨습니다
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	Truly a good-hearted person.
		정말 인간적인 분이셨어요
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:43	- I'm sorry.
		- It's okay.
		- 죄송합니다
		- 괜찮아요
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	Look, we can do this later.
		괜찮아지시면 다시 하죠
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:46	No, no, I'm fine, really.
		아뇨, 정말 괜찮습니다
00:00:48	 
		 
00:00:48	Were there any casings?
		탄피는 발견됐습니까?
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	Uh, one, from a .380.
		380mm로, 하나요
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:51	One? But she was
		shot three times.
		하지만 총상은 세군데였는데요
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Got people looking
		for the others.
		나머지를 찾고 있습니다
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:59	All right.
		좋아요
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:04	What kind of crimes do you
		usually see around here?
		이 근처에 흔한 범죄는 어떻습니까?
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	There's some drugs
		going through the valley...
		계곡 쪽에선 마약 관련 범죄들이.. 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	uh, meth, coke but...
		메테드린이나 코카인 같은거요
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:09	we deal mostly with
		vacationers, you know?
		대부분은 행락객들을 다룹니다 
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:11	Tourists at the resorts
		for spa vacations and such.
		리조트에 스파 패키지를 즐기러 온 사람들이요
00:01:13	 
		 
00:01:14	Could be road rage.
		길에서 우연히 붙은 시비일 수 있어요
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	Chief gets into a tangle
		with another car,
		길에서 사고로 어떤 차랑 얽혔는데 
00:01:17	 
		 
00:01:17	there's an accident,
		driver's got an attitude, a gun.
		하필이면 총을 가진 또라이라... 
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	Maybe.
		아마도
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:20	Not likely.
		그럴 가능성은 낮아 
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	What are you doing?
		넌 뭐해?
00:01:24	 
		 
00:01:24	I'm checking
		the chief's height.
		소장 키를 재는 중이야
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	She's about 5 or 6 inches
		shorter than I am.
		소장은 나보다 5, 6인치 정도 작은데 
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	The driver's seat is set back
		for someone at least my height.
		운전석은 나 정도 키에 맞춰져 있어
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:33	Maybe she was
		in the passenger seat.
		보조석에 있었나보죠
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	Passenger air bag didn't go off.
		Seat was empty.
		보조석 쪽 에어백은 터지지 않았어 
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	So where was she?
		그럼 소장은 어디 있었던 거죠?
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:50	Ahh.
		아아
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:52	Blood.
		핏자국이네 
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:56	So she was shot
		somewhere else,
		그럼 다른 어딘가에서 총을 맞고 
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	killer thought she was dead,
		put her in the trunk.
		범인은 소장이 죽었다고 생각에 트렁크에 실었는데
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:01	But she's alive,
		and she opens the escape latch,
		살아있었던 소장은 탈출하려 애썼지 
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:05	trunk pops open,
		트렁크가 열리니까 
00:02:06	 
		 
00:02:06	killer's startled,
		he crashes the car.
		범인은 놀라 차를 들이박은거야
00:02:08	 
		 
00:02:08	She gets out of the trunk,
		소장은 트렁크에서 떨어졌고 
00:02:09	 
		 
00:02:09	killer shoots her
		in the head here.
		범인은 소장 머리에 총을 쐈군요
00:02:11	 
		 
00:02:11	That's why they only
		found one casing.
		그래서 여기엔 탄피가 하나 뿐이구나 
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	She's not in a uniform,
		정복 차림이 아니었으니 
00:02:13	 
		 
00:02:13	so chances are
		she came from home.
		집에서 오는 길이었을 수 있어 
00:02:15	 
		 
00:02:15	Voila.
		그러네 
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:32	You start inside.
		I'll look around the property.
		난 주변을 둘러볼테니 들어가봐 
00:02:35	 
		 
00:03:07	CBI! Don't move.
		CBI다! 꼼짝마!
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	Whoa! Take it easy.
		진정하세요
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	On your knees.
		Hands on your head.
		무릎 끓고 두 손 머리에 올려
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:12	- No problem.
		- Do it now.
		- 알겠습니다
		- 지금 당장 
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:14	- Leave him alone!
		- Annie!
		- 너야말로 꺼져!
		- 애니!
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:17	Put that down!
		그거 내려놔!
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	Everybody stay calm.
		모두 냉정해 
00:03:19	 
		 
00:03:19	Damn it, Annie,
		I told you to stay in the car!
		애니, 빌어먹을 차 안에 있으랬잖아!
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	Now put that down!
		그 총 내려놔!
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	I mean it. Drop it!
		나 장난 아니야, 너나 내려놔!
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	Annie, do what I said!
		애니, 내 말 들어!
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	Listen to him.
		저 말 들어
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:27	What the hell's
		going on?!
		대체 이게 무슨 빌어처먹을 상황이야?
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:31	Tommy?
		토미?
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:34	Teresa?
		테레사?
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	Annabeth?
		애너베스?
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	Annie.
		애니예요
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐해?
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	What are you doing here?
		너는?
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	Wait, you know these people?
		이 사람들 아세요?
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	This is my little brother Tommy.
		내 동생 토미야
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:43	Hey, how's it going?
		요새 어떻게 지내?
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:45	And my niece Annabeth.
		조카 애너베스고
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:47	Annie. It's Annie.
		애니라구요
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	- No one calls me Annabeth.
		- Put the gun... put the gun down.
		- 한번만 더 애너베스라고 불렀담봐
		- 총 내려놔
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	Put it down.
		내려놓으라고 
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:54	I swear to God Rees,
		I told her to stay outside.
		맹세컨대, 리스 난 애더러 나가있으랬어

00:04:10	You could have killed
		somebody or gotten killed.
		사람을 죽이거나 네가 죽을 수 있었어 
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	Hey, it's a tough business.
		이 바닥 일이 이래요 
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:14	Hey, quit that.
		넌 가만 있어 
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	She knows not to touch the guns
		in the field, not ever.
		현장에선 총을 만져선 안된다는 걸 애도 안다고
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	In the field?
		현장?
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:19	Not ever.
		한번도 만진적 없어
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	Jeez. Sorry for
		trying to help out.
		도와줘도 뭐래요
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:26	She is sorry.
		She just won't admit it.
		미안하단 뜻이야 솔직하지 못해 그렇지 
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:28	Who's that remind you of?
		꼭 누구 보는 것 같지 않아?
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	What the hell is going on?
		이게 지금 뭐하는 짓인데?
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	Why are you here
		what are you doing?
		왜 여기 있으며?
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	I'm looking for a skip...
		도망자를 쫓고 있었어
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	A fugitive,
		someone who skipped bail.
		그러니까 보석금을 떼먹고 도망간 수배자 말야
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:36	I know what a skip is.
		나도 그게 뭔진 알아 
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	Since when are you
		a bounty hunter?
		대체 언제부터 현상금 사냥꾼 짓을 한 거야?
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	I'm a bail enforcement agent.
		난 보석금 위원회 소속 집행요원이야 
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	When I saw you last year
		작년에 봤을땐 
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	you were building decks
		with Eddie Duncan.
		에디 던컨과 인테리어 일을 했잖아 
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	Well, nobody wants a deck when
		the bank's at the door, Rees.
		주택경기가 확 죽었는데 인테리어 사업이 왠말이야, 리스 
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	I took a course in April.
		Tig Muldoon, Margo's cousin?
		4월부터 이쪽 일을 배웠어 마고 사촌 티그 멀던 알지?
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	He's a bondsman.
		He gave me a shot.
		그 사람이 보증을 서줬어 
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	I brought in six guys
		in the past two months,
		지난 두달간 여섯명을 잡아 넣었어 
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	made, like, 4 grand.
		4천달러나 벌었다고 
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:58	- Tommy, Tommy...
		- Oh, don't even start with that.
		- 토미... 
		- 아니, 시작할 꿈도 꾸지 마
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	With what?
		뭘?
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	Busting my chops
		like you always do,
		누나 항상 그러듯 
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	like I don't know
		what I'm doing.
		완전 세상 물정 모르는 놈 취급하는 것 말야
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Well, you don't.
		그렇잖아
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	I know what I'm doing.
		I'm a professional.
		난 여기 프로라고
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	Oh, right.
		아 그러네 
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	Taking your 13-year-old daughter
		along with you as backup...
		13살짜리 애를 조수라고 데리고 다니면서,
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	that's very professional.
		그것 참 되게 프로다
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	She's 14,
		14살이야
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	and that's not fair, because
		I did not want to bring her.
		그리고 애당초 달고 다닐 생각도 없었어
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	My psycho ex went to Miami
		with her boyfriend,
		내 싸이코 전처가 제 남친이랑 마이애미로 갔다고
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	so I got her.
		그래서 내가 애를 맡은거야 
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	You look good. You...
		Do something with your hair?
		누나 이뻐졌는데.. 머리에 뭐라도 했어?
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	You should be encouraging me.
		I'm trying here.
		호응 좀 해줘, 나름 애쓰고 있잖아 
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:31	Okay. What's the name
		of your fugitive?
		그래, 그 수배자 이름이 뭔데? 
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	His name's Carmine O'Brien.
		카민 오브라이언 
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	Jumped bail out of St. Louis.
		세인트 루이스에서 도망쳐 나왔어 
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	I found out about three days ago
		he bought a bus ticket here,
		3일전 여기로 오는 버스표를 샀더라고 
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	so I called this chief Green
		그래서 그린 소장에게 전화해 
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	and I asked her to keep an eye
		out for him until I got here.
		내가 도착할 때까지 놈을 감시해달라고 부탁했지 
00:05:46	 
		 
00:05:46	Then I heard on my scanner
		she got shot.
		그런데 듣자니 죽었다면서 
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	So you think the chief found
		O'Brien and then he killed her?
		소장에게 들킨 오브라이언이 소장을 죽였다?
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	Yeah, I don't know, maybe.
		어쩌면 
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Why break into her house?
		소장 집에는 왜 침입했어?
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	Door was open.
		문이 열려 있었어 
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	I just went in to find out
		what I could about O'Brien,
		오브라이언에 대해 건질게 있을까 들어가봤어 
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	that's all.
		그게 다야 
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Okay.
		그래 
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	When we pick him up,
		I'll let you know,
		오브라이언을 잡거든 연락할게 
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	but if he had any part in this
		murder, I can't give him to you.
		하지만 그자가 이 살인과 어떤 관련이 있으면 어림없어 
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	What makes you think
		I won't get him first?
		내가 먼저 잡으면 어떡할래?
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	Yeah, right.
		아 그래 
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	Oh, you don't think
		I can do it, huh?
		못할 줄 알지?
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	No, I don't.
		응
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	Fine. We'll see.
		좋아, 두고 보자고
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	Can you watch Annie?
		애니 좀 봐줄래?
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	Are you kidding? No. No.
		장난해? 싫어 난 싫어 
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	This is really dangerous work
		I'm doing.
		난 위험한 일을 하고 있다고 
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	Your office is a lot safer
		than my van, right?
		내 밴보단 누나 사무실에 두는게 안전하잖아 
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Besides, she needs
		some female time.
		그리고 여자 어른하고도 좀 있어 봐야지 
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	Her mom's such a freaking
		wackadoo, and you know,
		애 엄마는 완전 머리에 꽃단 여자고 
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:27	I'm a guy.
		누나도 알다시피 난 남자잖아
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:30	Damn it, Tommy.
		아, 씨발 토미

00:06:50	Hey.
		반장님
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	Carmine O'Brien
		is an accountant from St. Louis.
		카민 오브라이언은 세인트 루이스에서 회계사 일을 했어요
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	Uh, he was arrested three
		months ago for embezzlement,
		석달전 횡령죄로 체포됐는데 
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	skipped town

00:07:01	Might explain
		why he's hiding here.
		그래서 페어몬트로 숨어들었나 봐요
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	Any history of violence?
		폭력 전과는?
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	No. Strictly white collar.
		전형적인 화이트 칼라예요
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	Ivy league-educated,
		no prior arrests.
		아이비 리그 출신에 전과는 없어요
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	It's hard to see
		this guy shooting a cop.
		경찰을 쐈다고 믿기 힘든데요
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:10	That doesn't mean
		he didn't do it.
		쐈을수도 있지 
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	Have Cho go back to Fairmont
		and ask around.
		조에게 페어몬트로 가서 수사하라고 전해 
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	Run his credit card
		and phone records,
		카드와 전화 내역을 조사하고 
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	and have Rigsby
		put out a bolo.
		릭스비를 시켜 수배령을 내려
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	All right.
		네 
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:19	- Officer Price. Hi.
		- Hi.
		- 프라이스 순경
		- 안녕하세요 
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	Can I help you?
		뭘 도와드릴까요?
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	I feel bad about
		not checking that trunk.
		진작 트렁크를 봤어야 하는건데 속상하네요
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	Should have caught that,
		so, uh,
		Should have caught that,
		so, uh,
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	I went through
		the chief's files.
		소장님 사건 파일을 훑어봤는데요 
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:30	She pulled over a D.U.I.
		Day before yesterday...
		그저께 음주 운전자를 붙잡으셨더라구요
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	Russian guy
		named Dimitri Zubov.
		드미트리 주코프라는 러시아 남자였어요
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	He's still staying
		at one of the resorts.
		아직 그 근처 리조트에 있대요 
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	Well, what about him
		caught your eye?
		그 남자 뭐가 문제죠?
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	He blew a .076
		on a breathalyzer.
		혈중 알콜 농도가 076밖에 안됐어요
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:40	.76? That's under the limit.
		그럼 걸릴리가 없는데 
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	He wasn't drunk, but the chief
		arrested him anyway,
		취한게 아니었는데도 무작정 잡아 넣으셨어요
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	I mean,
		which is a waste of time,
		어차피 법정에 데려가봤자 
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	'cause once it goes to court,
		판사가 내보낼테니 
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	the judge is just
		gonna throw it out.
		순전한 시간낭비였는데요
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	That's not like her.
		소장님답지 않았어요
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:50	She was a real stickler
		for details.
		소장님은 세세한 것까지 잘 챙기셨거든요
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	Thanks. We'll check it out.
		고마워요, 체크해 볼게요
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:58	I want to help out
		any way I can.
		제가 할 수 있는건 뭐든지 도와드릴게요
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	I know a lot of the locals,
		지역 주민들을 잘 아니까 
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	if I can help out
		with interviews.
		심문하실때 도와드릴 수 있어요
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	We'll let you know.
		필요하면 연락할게요
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:09	Two fingers.
		Just dip and remove.
		두 손가락만 써서 살짝 담갔다 떼는거야
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	No hesitation.
		Want to give it a try?
		절대 주춤하지 말고 직접 해볼래?
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	Okay.
		해봐
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:18	Did you feel that?
		느꼈어요?
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	Well, just slightly.
		Did you feel that?
		아주 살짝 넌?
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	You're good.
		솜씨 좋은데요
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	Picking pockets. Nice.
		소매치기 가르치고 잘 한다
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	Oh, I promised I'd show her
		리스 고모에 대한 최고 빵터지는 얘기를 해주는 대신
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	if she'd tell me
		her best auntie Rees stories.
		기술을 보여주기로 했거든 
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	Don't you dare.
		너 진짜... 
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	Of course not.
		I was just stringing him along.
		물론 안해요 거짓말 친거예요
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	Oh, you were, were you? I guess
		I won't give you this, then.
		그랬어? 그럼 이거 안 준다
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	Hey.
		이봐요
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	Annabeth?
		애너베스?
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	- Annie.
		- Annie.
		- 애니예요
		- 애니라잖아 
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	Annie, Jane and I
		have to go to work.
		애니, 제인이랑 난 일하러 나가야 해 
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	You mind hanging out
		in my office?
		그 동안 내 사무실에 좀 있을래?
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	Sure.
		그럴게요
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	Rigsby's a nice, easy mark
		if you want to keep practicing.
		계속 연습하려면 릭스비가 가장 손쉬운 먹잇감이야
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:50	The D.U.I., Zubov?
		He's an economist.
		주코브란 음주 운전자, 경제학자야
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	He's in Fairmont for
		some sort of trade conference.
		페어몬트에는 무슨 무역 컨퍼런스 때문에 왔는데 
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	He stayed on for vacation.
		아예 눌러앉아 휴가를 즐기는 참인가봐
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	Fascinating, but not what
		you really want to talk about.
		흥미롭군 하지만 정작 하고 싶은 얘긴 그게 아닐텐데 
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	I cannot believe my
		brother's a bounty hunter.
		내 남동생이 현상금 사냥이나 하고 다닌다니 말이 안돼 
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	There we go.
		어, 그 얘기 
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	All of a sudden
		he's some sort of tough guy?
		지가 언제부터 터프가이였다고? 웃겨
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	Who does he think
		he's fooling?
		세상에 그리고 누가 저를 무시한다고?
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	Not you.
		너는 아닌가보지 
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	You know what bugs me?
		He didn't even tell me.
		뭐가 제일 짜증나는지 알아? 나한테 입도 뻥긋 안했어
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	It's not like we don't talk.
		그동안 통화를 안한 것도 아닌데 
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	I could have told him
		this was a bad idea.
		내가 알았으면 하지 마라 충고했을걸 
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	All he had to do
		was pick up the phone and call,
		그냥 전화하는게 그렇게 어려워?
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	- but instead, nothing.
		- Wonder why that is...
		- 손가락이 뿌러졌어?
		- 왜였을까나... 
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	I basically raised
		that punk and his brothers.
		그 멍청이랑 다른 놈들 전부 내 손에서 자랐어
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	It's not my fault
		if he doesn't communicate.
		그놈 멍청하게 구는게 내 탓은 아냐
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:20	Oh, you think
		it is my fault.
		넌 내 탓이라고 생각하는거지 
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	No, I didn't say that.
		You said that.
		난 아무 말도 안했다? 니가 했다?
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	I say live and let live.
		You'll all be happier.
		그냥 흘러가는대로 놔두면 훨씬 편해질거야
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Oh, mind your own business.
		자기 앞가림이나 하면서 그런 말을 하시지 
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	Last name O'Brien,
		first name Carmine.
		성은 오브라이언, 이름이 카민
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	Gonna e-mail you a picture
		right now.
		메일로 사진 보냈어요
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	Let me know if there's any hits.
		Thanks. Bye.
		뭐라도 건지면 연락해요 
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	- Hey.
		- Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	You were just calling in
		a bolo for O'Brien, right?
		방금 오브라이언 수배령 내린 거예요?
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:40	Yep.
		응 
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	Nice.
		와
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:46	Can I ask you a question?
		하나 물어봐도 돼요?
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	Sure.
		그럼
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	Your sig sauer... is that a .357,
		a .40, or the 9-millimeter?
		갖고 있는 시그 사우어.. 구경이 뭐예요?
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	It's a 9-millimeter.
		9mm야
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:53	Great gun.
		근사한데요
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	Thank you.
		고마워
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	Hey.
		릭스비 
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	Forensics just came back.
		검시관이 막 돌아왔대 
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	No prints off
		chief Green's cruiser.
		그린 소장의 차에선 지문이 안 나왔어
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	Killer must have wiped the car.
		범인이 닦은 모양이야 
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	You got anything
		on O'Brien's family in his file?
		오브라이언 가족에 대해선 뭐 없어?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	Uh, his parents are dead.
		He's an only child.
		부모님은 죽었고 형제는 없대 
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:09	You know,
		if you're looking for leads,
		단서가 필요하면 말이죠, 
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	you should check out
		the ex-girlfriend.
		전 여자친구를 뒤져봐요
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	My dad says
		they have a kid together.
		우리 아빠가 그러는데 둘 사이에 애도 있었대요
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	All right. Thanks.
		We'll look into it.
		고맙다, 알아볼게 
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	No problem.
		뭘요
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:20	So do you have a girlfriend?
		애인 있어요?
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	Yes, I do, as it happens.
		어쩌다보니 
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	Are you in love with her?
		사랑해요?
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	Oh, good question.
		좋은 질문이네 
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	Well, it's hard to say.
		I mean, it's...
		말하기 어려운 문젠데... 
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Is she cute?
		귀여워요?
00:10:31	 
		 
00:10:31	You know, maybe you should wait
		in your aunt Teresa's office.
		너 그냥 테레사 고모 사무실에 가 있는게 낫겠다 
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:39	Hey...
		야...!
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:48	Mr. Zubov, what can you
		tell us about your arrest?
		주코브씨, 그날 왜 체포되셨죠?
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	I stand charged
		with a crime I did not commit.
		나랑 아무 상관도 없는 죄로 체포됐소
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	Chief Green insisted
		I was drunk.
		그린 소장은 내가 취했다고 우겼지만 
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	I was not, but she would not
		listen to reason.
		아니었는데 내 말은 들으려고도 않더군 
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	Did you have any contact with
		chief Green after your address?
		그 후에는 그린 소장과 만난 적이 있습니까?
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	Are you sure I cannot
		get you something to drink?
		정말로 한 잔 하지 않아도 좋습니까?
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:05	It's very hot.
		오늘 날이 찌는데 
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	No, thank you, Mr. Zubov.
		아뇨, 괜찮습니다
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:07	Just answer the question,
		please.
		그냥 질문에만 대답하세요
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	No. No contact with chief Green.
		그 날 이후 만난 적은 없소 
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	And where were you
		last night?
		그럼 지난 밤엔 어디 계셨죠?
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	Last night I had
		something to eat,
		어젯밤엔 식사를 했지 
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:16	I had a drink.
		술도 마셨고 
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	I had a little more to drink,
		but, uh, heh, no driving.
		좀 많이 마셨지만, 운전은 안했소
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	Mr. Zubov?
		주코브씨?
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	Are you ready
		for your massage?
		마사지 시간이 다 됐는데요
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	A new girl. Hello.
		처음 보는 아가씨군 
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	Duty calls. Am I done?
		가봐도 될지?
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	Mr. Zubov's gonna
		have to reschedule.
		지금은 불가능하세요
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	Of course.
		알겠습니다
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	Now it's all very clear.
		이거야 틀림없군요
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	You're quite the, uh,
		sex fiend, aren't you?
		그러니까.. 색정광 같은거네요, 당신?
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	What do you mean?
		뭐라구요?
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	Well, you automatically tried
		to seduce agent Lisbon here,
		거의 반자동으로 여기 리스본 요원을 꼬시려고 했다가, 
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	but it was the masseuse that
		really got your blood pumping.
		또 안마사가 오니까 심장이 벌렁벌렁 하시는데요
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	You're like an owl
		watching a mouse.
		거의 쥐를 노리는 부엉이급이네요
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	No. I'm not.
		아니오
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Chief Green thought
		you'd committed a crime,
		그린 소장은 당신이 뭔가 저질렀는 줄은 알았지만 
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	but it wasn't drunk
		driving, was it?
		그게 음주운전은 아니었던 거죠?
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	What was it, I wonder?
		그게 뭐였을까요?
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	This is ridiculous.
		이건 정말 어이가 없군 
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	No. You know what's ridiculous?
		Is this. This, uh, ascot...
		진짜 어이가 없는게 뭔 줄 알아요?
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	- give me this back.
		- That's ridiculous. No.
		- 그거 이리 내요
		- 바로 이거라구요 안 줄거예요
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	You mind sharing with us
		그 상처가 어쩌다 생긴건지 
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	how you got those scratches
		on your neck?
		말씀해 주시겠습니까?
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	I was hiking
		and boom... I fell.
		하이킹을 하다 쿵 넘어진거요
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:08	Hiking.
		하이킹이래 
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	Really?
		진짜요?
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	Yes, hiking.
		하이킹이었소
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	I refuse to
		discuss this further.
		더 이상의 대화는 거절하겠소
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:19	Now all we have to do
		is find the woman he assaulted.
		이제 피해 여성만 찾으면 되네
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	Well, she's reluctant
		to make a public accusation.
		어쩌면 나와서 증언하길 꺼려할지도 
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	That's why, uh,
		chief hung the D.U.I. on Zubov.
		그래서 소장이 음주운전을 들먹인거지 
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	To buy time to convince
		the victim to testify. It fits.
		증인의 마음을 돌리려면 시간이 필요하니까 
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	But without an actual victim,
		we don't have anything.
		하지만 피해자 없이 우린 아무것도 못해 
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	I can't even get
		a search warrant for his room.
		저자 방에 수색영장 하나 청구할 수 없어 
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	Zubov's an opportunist.
		주코브는 기회주의자야 
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	The question is,
		where did he have opportunity?
		그 기회를 어디서 얻었을까가 문제지 
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	CBI.
		CBI요!
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	Chad Carmichael,

00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	What I can I do for you?
		무엇을 도와드릴까요?
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	We're investigating a crime that
		relates to one of your guests,
		리조트 손님이 관계된 사건 수사중입니다 
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	Dimitri Zubov.
		드미트리 주코브라는 사람인데 
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	Oh. What did he do?
		그분이 무슨 일을?
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	We're not at liberty to say,
		but what we're gonna need is
		공개할 순 없습니다 
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	a list of all of your staff that
		have been in Mr. Zubov's room
		하지만 주코브씨 방에 출입한 모든 직원 명단과 
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	and security camera
		footage
		주코브씨 객실 복도를 촬영한 
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	from the hallway
		outside his door.
		감시카메라 영상이 필요합니다 
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	Uh, that's problematic.
		Mr. Zubov is a valued guest.
		주코브씨는 저희 VIP입니다 곤란한데요
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	It's cold in here.
		꽤 쌀쌀하네요, 방이 
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	Is... is that your, uh,
		own personal air conditioner?
		그건 혼자 두고 쓰시는 에어컨?
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	Uh, yes.
		네 
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	Fancy. A place like this
		doesn't have central air?
		이런데는 중앙 냉난방을 하지 않나요?
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	I guess I just like it cold.
		전 약간 쌀쌀한게 좋아서 
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	What's going on here?
		무슨 일이지?
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	Dad. This is my father,
		Philip Carmichael.
		필립 카마이클, 저희 아버지세요
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	He owns the resort.
		리조트 오너시죠
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	Government people, are you?
		정부에서 나온 사람들이요?
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	These people are with CBI.
		CBI에서 왔대요
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	They need a permission
		about a guest.
		손님 신상에 대해 알아야겠다고
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	And you didn't call me?
		그런데 내게 연락을 안했어?
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	@@/It is my job.
		I'm handling it.@@\
		제 일이니까 알아서 할 수 있어요
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:45	We're happy to assist
		law enforcement at any time.
		언제든지 경찰 여러분께 최선의 협조를 하겠습니다 
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	We just need a search warrant.
		수색 영장만 가져오시면요
00:13:49	 
		 
00:13:49	I can't give you the details,
		but Mr. Zubov may be involved
		자세히 알려드릴 순 없지만 주코브씨는 
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	in the murder of chief Green.
		This is extremely important.
		그린 소장 죽음에 연루되어 있습니다 정말 중요한 사안입니다
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	Oh, my God. Really?
		정말인가요?
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:57	And I sympathize,
		마음이 아프군요 
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	but we have to respect
		the privacy of our guests.
		하지만 여긴 손님의 프라이버시를 지켜야 할 의무가 있습니다
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	Son, show them out,
		and next time, call.
		배웅해 드려 그리고 다음엔 바로 보고해 
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:11	Does the old tyrant always
		talk to you like that?
		저 꼴통 파쇼는 말하는게 맨날 저래요?
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:14	So you're thinking maybe
		Zubov killed chief Green?
		주코브가 그린 소장을 죽였을 수도 있다구요?
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	Yes, possibly.
		아마도요
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:22	I'll get the video for you.
		Wait here.
		cctv 영상 따다 드릴게요
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	Thank you, Chad.
		고마워요, 채드 
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	Not easy with a father
		like that, but thank you.
		저런 아버지 모시고 사는 거 참 힘들텐데 
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	Appreciate it.
		고마워요
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:36	Mmm.
		흐음
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:37	- You still in Fairmont?
		- Yeah.
		- 아직 페어몬트예요?
		- 응
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	Go to 787 Elm street.
		O'Brien's there right now.
		엘름가 787번지요, 오브라이언이 거기 있대요
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	How'd you get the address?
		주소는 어떻게 알아냈어?
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	His ex has been getting calls
		from a cell in town.
		전 여자친구에게 전화를 했더라구요
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	We accessed that cell's GPS
		and pulled the location.
		위성으로 주소를 알아냈어요
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	Got it.
		알았어
00:14:48	 
		 
00:15:01	O'Brien!
		오브라이언!
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	O'Brien! CBI! Don't move!
		CBI다, 움직이지 마!
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:20	Ow.
		 
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	You okay?!
		거기 괜찮아요?
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:34	They say it's either
		a sprained muscle in your back
		등 근육이 놀랐거나 
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	or a ruptured disc.
		허리 디스크거나 그럴 수 있대 
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	They'll be able to tell you
		at the hospital.
		확실한 건 병원에서 검사를 해 봐야 한다고
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	I'm fine.
		저 괜찮아요
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	Go to the hospital!
		가, 병원 
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	Yeah, okay.
		알겠습니다
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	What's up?
		무슨 일이야?
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	I've been going through
		the security footage,
		감시 카메라 영상을 보고 있는데요
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	and I may have found
		the woman Zubov assaulted.
		주코브가 폭행한 여자를 찾은 것 같아요
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	It's a maid. She's crying,
		and her uniform is torn.
		객실 청소부인데 울고 있고 유니폼이 찢어져 있어요
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	Work schedule says her name
		근무 시간표를 보니 
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	is Sofia Chavez.
		이름이 소피아 차베즈라네요
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	All right. Bring her in.
		알았어, 데려와서 얘기해 
00:15:59	 
		 
00:15:59	How's your guy?
		부하는 좀 어때?
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	He's hurt pretty bad.
		심하게 다쳤어 
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:01	Yeah, looked pretty rough.
		그런거 같더라
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	You shouldn't have been here.
		네가 여기 왜 있는지 모르겠다 
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	I told you I was
		going after O'Brien.
		나도 오브라이언을 쫓겠다고 했잖아 
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	I mean, stuff happens
		when you're chasing guys.
		이 일 하다 보면 종종 있는 일이야
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	It could have been me
		that got knocked down.
		내가 저 자리에 누웠을 수도 있었어 
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	Your daughter almost
		got shot this morning,
		네 딸은 오늘 거의 총맞기 직전이었고
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	and I've got a guy
		going to the hospital
		네 철없는 행동으로 
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	because you don't know
		what you're doing.
		내 부하녀석은 병원에 실려갔어
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	Oh, like hell, I don't.
		누가 철이 없어
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	You know how I got O'Brien?
		내가 오브라이언을 어떻게 따라왔는지 알아?
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	He's a type 1 diabetic,
		and I paid the pharmacist
		놈은 당뇨를 앓고 있다고 
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	to tell me when he was
		coming in to buy Insulin.
		그래서 약사에게 돈을 주고 인슐린을 사러 나타날때 연락하라 했지 
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	That's skill.
		Your people think of that?
		이게 바로 테크닉의 차이야 누나 부하들은 생각이나 했대?
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Somebody could have
		gotten killed.
		사람이 죽을 수도 있었어 
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	Look, I love you, but...
		토미, 난 널 사랑해 하지만... 
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	"I love you, but..."
		"But" what, sis?
		하지만, 뭐? 
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	"But... you're a loser. You'll
		always be a loser. Just quit."
		'하지만 넌 늘 찐따였어, 찐따답게 닥쳐' 이거?
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	I love you, but you and Annabeth
		need to go home.
		널 사랑하지만 애너베스랑 같이 집에 가라고 
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	Tommy, you should think
		about going back to school,
		토미, 공부를 다시 시작해봐
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	learn a trade.
		You always liked electronics.
		무역을 배워 전자공학도 좋아했잖아 
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	Okay, sure.
		Trade school it is.
		알았어, 무역을 배우라 이거지 
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	You want me to detail your car
		for you before I go?
		그 전에 누나 세차라도 해주고 갈까?
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	Tommy, come on.
		토미, 이러지 마
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	Agent Lisbon,
		we've set up roadblocks
		리스본 요원, 도로는 봉쇄했습니다
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	and we're sending officers
		to look for O'Brien.
		그리고 사람을 풀어 오브라이언을 수색 중입니다
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	You want to talk to 'em?
		가서 하실 말씀이 있습니까?
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	We'll finish this later.
		넌 이따 다시 얘기해 
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:06	I have nothing to say.
		난 얘기할 것 없어요
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	I go in room,
		I clean, I leave.
		방에서, 청소, 나왔어요
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	Wait.
		잠깐요
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	Zubov didn't assault you?
		Didn't hurt you?
		주코브가 공격하지 않았어요? 당신 다치게 않았어요?
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	No.
		않았어요
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:17	Sofia, I don't work
		for immigration.
		소피아, 난 이민국 사람 아니에요
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Nothing's gonna happen to you.
		I promise.
		소피아한테 아무 일 없을 거예요, 약속해요
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:27	So this is just us?
		우리 둘만? 
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	No police?
		경찰 없어요?
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:33	No.
		없어요
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	Just us.
		우리 둘 사이 얘기에요
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:37	I clean room.
		청소했어요
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	I think I alone.
		혼자라고 생각했어요
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	He come out of bathroom.
		남자 화장실에서 나왔어요
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	He put hand on me. He...
		나한테 손댔어요
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	he rip my, um, this.
		내 이거, 찢었어요
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	He ripped your uniform.
		유니폼을 찢었군요
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	Yes.
		네 
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	I scared. I run for door.
		무서워서, 문으로 달렸어요
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	He grab me.
		남자가 잡았어요
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	I fight.
		나 싸웠어요
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	I get out.
		나왔어요
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	Who told chief Green
		about it?
		그린 소장에게 말했나요?
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:10	I told.
		했어요
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	She was my friend.
		내 친구예요
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	She tell me to accuse Zubov,
		but I say no.
		주코브를 기소하겠다고 했지만 싫었어요
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	She say she keep him
		until I change my mind...
		내가 마음 바꿀때까지 잡아놓는다고 했어요
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:27	But I no change.
		하지만 마음 안 바꿨어요
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:33	He kill her?
		소장을 죽였어요?
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	It's a possibility.
		그럴 수도 있어요
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	That's why it's so important
		for you to come forward.
		그러니 당신이 꼭 나서줘야 해요
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	Why?
		왜요?
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	The rich... they get away
		with everything.
		부자들은 다 빠져나가요
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:52	Any luck finding O'Brien?
		오브라이언 찾는데 진전은 있어?
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	- Look...
		- We're leaving tomorrow.
		- 야... 
		- 우린 내일 떠나려고 해 
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	I don't know.
		Maybe you're right.
		어쩌면 누나 말이 맞을지도 모르지 
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Maybe I'm not
		cut out for this.
		이 일에 맞지 않는 걸지도 몰라
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	Really?
		정말?
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	Yeah, really. What business
		do I have bounty hunting?
		그래 현상금 사냥이라니 내가 무슨 짓인지 
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Truth is, it's not the first
		time I thought about quitting.
		어차피 뭘 중간에 집어치는게 처음도 아니고
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	Tommy...
		토미... 
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	It's probably for the best.
		이게 최선일지 몰라 
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	Annabeth will dismember me if we
		leave without saying good-bye.
		우리가 제대로 인사도 않고 떠났단 애너베스가 날 죽이려 할거야
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	You want to
		get lunch tomorrow?
		내일 점심 먹을래?
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	Sure.
		그럼 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:19	This is absurd.
		정말 어처구니가 없군요
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	There is no victim of
		an assault. Where is she?
		사건에 피해자가 없다니 여잔 어딨소?
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Well, there is a victim...
		Sofia Chavez.
		소피아 차베즈씨라고 피해자는 있습니다 
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	Victim? Please.
		피해자라뇨?
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	I ask her to touch me...
		오히려 내가 날 건드려 달라고 부탁했소
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	- Dimitri...
		- It's okay. It's okay.
		- 드미트리, 
		- 괜찮아
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	I ask. She refuses. That's all.
		난 부탁했고, 여자가 거절했고, 그게 다요
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	I only ask her
		그날따라 내 안마사가 너무 못생겼길래 
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	because my masseuse that day
		was little bit ugly, you know?
		그랬던 것 뿐이요
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	I see. And normally
		you assault your masseuse?
		그럼 평소엔 안마사를 추행하시나 보죠?
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	You make it sound so crude.
		말을 상당히 품위없이 하는군
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	I love women.
		And love is beautiful, no?
		난 여자들을 사랑해 사랑이란 아름다운 것 아니요?
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	All right. Uh, you have
		no case here, agent.
		아무튼 여긴 성립할 사건이 없소 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	Unless there's
		anything else...
		다른 볼일이 없다면... 
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	Listen, Mr. Zubov, we checked
		the security footage.
		이봐요, 우린 보안 카메라 영상을 갖고 있어요
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	We know that you weren't back
		in your room until after 12:00
		그린 소장이 죽은 날 밤 
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	the night that
		chief Green was killed.
		12시까지 객실에 돌아오지 않았더군요
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Where were you before then?
		그때 어디 있었습니까?
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	You don't have to answer that.
		대답하지 마요
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	Oh, we'll find out
		where you were.
		안 그래도 우리가 찾아낼 겁니다
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	It's just a question
		of time.
		단지 시간 문제죠
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:11	I went to chief Green's home.
		그린 소장 집에 갔었소
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	- Son of a bitch.
		- To discuss my arrest.
		- 이 개자식
		- 체포건에 대해 의논하려고
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	To see if something
		could be done.
		그리고 내가 할 수 있는 일이 없나도 보고
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	It's starting
		to become a bit tedious here.
		얘기하다보니 좀 지루해지더군
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	So you went to bribe her?
		소장을 매수하러 갔습니까?
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	I was hoping to find a mutual
		acceptable resolution.
		상호간에 수용 가능한 해법을 모색하러 간 거지 
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	But a friend
		of the chief's arrives.
		하지만 소장의 친구가 왔어
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	A big woman.
		몸집이 커다란 여자였지 
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	Uh, Jori. Jori, I think
		her name was.
		이름은 조리였나 그랬던 것 같아
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	She was upset.
		About what, I don't know.
		이유는 모르겠지만 화가 잔뜩 나 있었지
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	And I left.
		그래서 떠났소
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	Jori?
		조리?
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:39	Must be Jori Kasser.
		조리 캐서일 거예요
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:41	Uh, the Russian was with
		chief Green when I got there,
		네 제가 갔을때 러시아 남자가 있었어요
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	but he left right away.
		하지만 즉시 떠나더군요
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:45	What were you doing that late at
		the chief's house, Ms. Kasser?
		왜 늦게 소장의 집에 가셨죠, 캐서씨?
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	Chief Green
		had left a message.
		그린 소장이 문자를 줬어요
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	Wanted to know
		where my son Steven was.
		우리 아들 스티븐이 어디 있는지 아냐고
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	You know why
		she was looking for him?
		소장은 왜 아드님을 찾았죠?
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	Steven has
		some drug problems.
		스티븐은 마약 문제가 있었어요
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Knows a bit about
		Fairmont's seedy side.
		페어몬트의 밑바닥에 대해 좀 알았죠
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	Chief would go to him for
		information from time to time.
		소장은 스티븐에게서 때로 정보를 얻곤 하셨어요
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	Uh, chief Green said
		that a fugitive
		소장님은 그 수배자가 
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	might be hiding out
		in Fairmont
		페어몬트에 숨어있지 않을까 생각했고 
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:04	and wanted to know if Steven
		had heard anything about him.
		스티븐에게 정보를 얻으려 하셨죠
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	Why not call?
		Why go in person?
		왜 전화를 않고 개인적으로 가셨죠?
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	I needed to ask a favor.
		부탁할게 있었어요
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	Um, I'd overheard Steven say
		스티븐이 휴양림의 오두막촌으로 
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	that he was going up
		to a cabin in the woods.
		올라갈거란 말을 엿들었어요
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:19	I know what he does there.
		He buys drugs.
		거기서 마약을 사곤 했거든요
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	And I asked the chief,
		if that was what he was doing,
		그래서 소장님께 아들놈을 찾거든 
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	to get him
		into a treatment program.
		치료 프로그램에 넣어달라고 부탁했어요
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	He really wants to get clean.
		스티븐은 정말 약을 끊고 싶어했어요
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	Ms. kasser, we need
		to speak to your son.
		아드님과 얘기를 해야겠어요
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	Where is he?
		어디있죠?
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	That's the thing.
		그게 문제예요
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	I haven't heard from Steven
		since I talked to the chief.
		소장님을 만난 이후론 아들을 못 봤어요
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	Steve's missing?
		실종됐다구요?
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	Why didn't you say
		anything?
		왜 여태 말 안했어요?
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	I was hoping
		it was a coincidence.
		우연이길 바랐어요
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	Sometimes he disappears.
		가끔 그렇게 연락을 안하거든요
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:51	Do you think your son
		had something to do
		소장의 죽음에 아드님이 
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:52	with the murder
		of chief Green?
		연루되어 있을거라 보시나요?
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:57	No, not if he was sober.
		그애가 제정신이기만 했어도 아닐 거예요
00:21:59	 
		 
00:22:02	Hey, boss.
		반장님 
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	Jori Kasser says her son
		조리 캐서가 말하길 
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	might have been involved
		in the murder.
		어쩌면 아들이 살인사건에 연루됐을지 모르겠답니다
00:22:06	 
		 
00:22:06	Apparently he was buying drugs
		up at some cabin.
		그곳 휴양림 어디선가 마약을 샀어요
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	Price and I
		are gonna check it out.
		프라이스와 가서 확인해 보겠습니다
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	Call my cell
		if you find anything.
		뭔가 찾으면 휴대폰으로 전화해 
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	I'm gonna be out of the office
		for a couple hours.
		몇시간 사무실을 비울 거야 
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	Anything on Zubov?
		Yeah, Van Pelt's on it.
		- 주코브한테선 뭐 없고?
		- 반펠트가 보고 있어요
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:16	Yeah, thanks.
		감사합니다
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	Problem?
		뭐 잘못됐어?
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	M.E. puts the time of death
		between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M.
		검시관 말론 사망시각이 2시에서 3시 사이래요
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	Zubov was in his room
		from midnight on.
		주코브는 그때 자기 객실에 있었어요
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	He couldn't be the killer.
		주코브는 아니예요
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:25	Mm.
		음 
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	He was a non-starter anyhow.
		주코브는 원래부터도 아니었어
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:28	And Sofia Chavez
		won't testify against him.
		그리고 소피아 차베즈가 입을 열 생각을 안해요
00:22:30	 
		 
00:22:30	We can't even touch
		the scumbag.
		그 개자식에 손도 까닥 못하잖아요
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	The world's full
		of scumbags we can't touch.
		세상은 우리가 못 건드리는 개자식 투성이야
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	I know, I know.
		It's just...
		알아요, 아는데요... 
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	I hear you. It'd soothe
		your troubled soul
		그러니까 이 개자식이라도 처넣을 수 있다면 
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	if you could just stick it
		to this particular scumbag.
		네 상처받은 영혼이 달래질거라 이 말이지 
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	Well, yeah. I guess
		it kind of would.
		그 뭐 비슷할 것 같아요
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:44	Shall we?
		그럼 가볼까? 
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:52	They're, uh, rental cabins
		for vacationers.
		행락객에게 방갈로를 대여해요
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:54	But they're being
		renovated now.
		하지만 이 근처는 리노베이션 중이죠
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	Pretty isolated.
		완전히 고립무원이네요
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	Get many drug buys up here?
		마약거래는 자주 있나요?
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	Heard rumors there were.
		그렇다고 해요
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	Hard to imagine Steve
		hanging out in these parts.
		스티브가 여길 드나들다니 믿을 수 없군요
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	He's not what you'd call
		a country boy.
		흙만지는건 질색하는 녀석인데 
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	That pile of leaves there.
		저기 나뭇잎 더미요
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:11	Who's raking leaves
		up here?
		누가 저렇게 모아다놨지?
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:30	Steve Kasser?
		스티브 캐서인가요?
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	I better call his mother.
		그 어머니에게 전화할게요
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	Yeah.
		 
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:50	Mr. Zubov?
		주코브씨?
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	Are you ready
		for your massage?
		마사지 받으실 준비는 되셨나요?
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	Ah, very nice.
		이거 훌륭하군
00:23:56	 
		 
00:23:56	Yes, please.
		Uh, lead the way.
		내가 앞장서리다
00:23:58	 
		 
00:24:14	Hmm.
		 
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:18	Rigsby. What's the word?
		릭스비, 무슨 일?
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	Lisbon's not answering
		her phone.
		반장님이 전화를 안 받으셔서요
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:22	Any idea where she is?
		반장님 어디 계신지 아세요?
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:23	Nope.
		몰라
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:24	We got another vic
		dead by a rental cabin.
		휴양림에서 피해자가 또 나왔어요
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	I think it's connected
		to chief Green.
		그린 소장 사건하고 관련있는 것 같아요
00:24:28	 
		 
00:24:28	Drug thing, looks like.
		마약 문제로 보여요
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	Cocaine?
		코카인?
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:30	Yeah. Victim had
		about 5 grams on him.
		피해자한테도 5그램 정도 나왔어요
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	Hmm. Is there just
		one cabin,
		방갈로가 거기 하나야, 
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	or are others nearby?
		아니면 근처에 많아?
00:24:36	 
		 
00:24:36	There's a few.
		몇개 더 있어요
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:40	I-I made a mistake!
		I didn't know that...
		실수였소! 난 모르고... 
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	Uh, gotta go.
		I'll see you up there later.
		아, 가봐야겠다 거긴 이따 들를게 
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	If I knew...
		모르고 그런.. 
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	Wha...
		 
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	You're under arrest...
		드미트리 주코브, 
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	- Oh, look...
		- For solicitation,
		- 이봐요.. 
		- 경찰에 대한 교사죄, 
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:51	sexual assault,
		assault on a police officer,
		성추행, 폭행죄로 체포한다
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:54	Wait, please...
		이봐요, 잠시만... 
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:55	You have the right
		to remain silent.
		당신은 묵비권을 행사할 수 있으며, 
00:24:57	 
		 
00:24:57	Anything you say can and will
		be used against you
		당신의 증언은 법정에서 
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	in a court of law.
		불리하게 사용될 수 있다
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:07	Nice shooting.
		사격 실력이 괜찮은데 
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:10	I practice a lot
		on the gun range with dad.
		아빠랑 여러번 연습했어요
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:14	It's good that you spend time
		with your dad,
		아빠랑 잘 지낸다니 다행이다
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:16	but you should do
		other stuff too...
		하지만 다른데도 관심을 가져
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	Kid stuff.
		보다 아이다운 데 말야
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	Why? I already know
		what I wanna do.
		왜요? 제가 하고 싶은 일이라면 잘 알아요
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	Really? What's that?
		그게 뭔데?
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	I wanna be a cop.
		Like you.
		경찰이 될 거예요 고모처럼 
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	I'm flattered. I am.
		이건 기분 좋은데, 정말이야
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	But I don't think you really
		know what you want yet.
		하지만 나중에 생각하면 달라질 거야 
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:29	You don't have to.
		It's okay.
		꼭 나처럼 될 필요는 없어
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	Yeah, I do.
		아니요
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	I sleep five hours
		a night.
		난 하루에 다섯시간밖에 못 자 
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	I haven't been able to get away
		to see you and your dad
		일년에 한번 
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:38	and your uncles
		in over a year.
		너랑 너희 아빠나 다른 삼촌 만나는 것도 어려워 
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	That's not what you want.
		이렇게 살고 싶진 않을걸 
00:25:40	 
		 
00:25:40	Aunt Teresa, you get paid
		to carry a glock.
		경찰 뱃지를 차려면 댓가를 치러야죠
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:44	You beat up people
		when they get out of line.
		고모는 도를 넘은 놈들을 두들겨 패 정신차리게 하잖아요
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	You're totally badass.
		고모는 진짜 짱이에요
00:25:47	 
		 
00:25:47	My point still stands.
		그래도 내 충고 명심하렴
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	Come on.
		어서..
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	Come on. Come on.
		어서... 
00:25:54	 
		 
00:25:59	Hi.
		안녕 
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:01	You got a text
		while you were gone.
		자리 비운 사이에 문자가 와 있더라
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	- I did?
		- Yeah.
		- 그랬어?
		- 응
00:26:04	 
		 
00:26:04	How'd you do?
		어땠어?
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	- I kicked butt.
		- Yes, she did.
		- 잘했어
		- 응, 잘했어 
00:26:08	 
		 
00:26:10	I gotta go back to work.
		돌아가 봐야겠다
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	- Already?
		- Yeah.
		- 벌써요?
		- 응
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:21	Keep in touch.
		연락하자
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	Absolutely, Rees.
		물론이지, 리스 
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	I'll call you
		when I learn that trade.
		무역 배우거든 전화할게 
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	Bye.
		잘 가
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	Bye.
		잘 가
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:30	Hey, Rigs.
		I got your text.
		릭스, 문자 봤다
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	Did you find Steve Kasser?
		스티브 캐서를 찾았어?
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	Yeah, looks like
		he's been dead a couple days.
		그런데 죽은지 며칠은 됐어요
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	Damn. What a shame.
		망할 
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	- Did the coroner show up?
		- Nope.
		- 검시관은 왔어?
		- 아직요
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:41	They should be soon.
		곧 온대요
00:26:43	 
		 
00:26:45	Steve was shot twice in
		the back. Killer used a .380.
		등에 두발 맞았고 구경은 0380mm 이예요
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	Same caliber as chief Green.
		그린 소장을 쏜 것과 같아요
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	Yeah, and there's more blood
		over there.
		여긴 피가 더 있어요 
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Chief Green's,
		I'm betting.
		소장 피겠죠
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:52	So chief Green comes here
		looking for Steve.
		그럼 소장은 스티브를 찾으러 여기 왔는데
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	Steve's buying coke
		from a dealer.
		스티브는 딜러에게 마약을 사고 있었고 
00:26:57	 
		 
00:26:57	The dealer sees the chief,
		딜러가 소장을 보자 
00:26:58	 
		 
00:26:58	freaks out and kills
		both her and Steve.
		겁을 먹어 소장과 스티브를 죽인거군 
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:00	He dumps chief Green
		in her police cruiser,
		소장은 차에 실었지만 
00:27:02	 
		 
00:27:02	but he's too heavy,
		so he hides him here.
		스티브는 무거워서 여기 숨겨놓고 간거죠
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	Makes sense,
		but that scenario
		말이 되네 
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	pretty much eliminates
		O'Brien as a suspect.
		하지만 그렇게 보면 오브라이언은 여기서 빠지지 
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	And whatever an Ivy league
		accountant was doing in town,
		아이비리그 출신 회계사가 여기서 뭘 했건 
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	he wasn't doing coke.
		코카인을 하던 건 아니었어 
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:11	So he's not the killer.
		That's one off the list.
		그럼 용의자 명단에서 제외되네요
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:13	Why is
		Philip Carmichael here?
		왜 필립 카마이클이 여기 있지? 
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:14	He owns the cabins.
		방갈로촌이 저 사람 거래요
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:16	He's here to let us in,
		see what we can find.
		들어와서 수사하게 해 줬어요
00:27:17	 
		 
00:27:17	All right. Give a yell
		if you need anything.
		알았어, 뭐 찾으면 얘기해 
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	- Okay.
		- Have you seen Jane?
		- 네 
		- 제인 봤어?
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:20	Says he'll be up here later.
		이따 여기 들를 거라던데요
00:27:21	 
		 
00:28:36	Will this take long?
		오래 걸립니까?
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:37	It'll take
		as long as it takes.
		걸릴만큼 걸리겠죠
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	Hey, check it out.
		봅시다
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	Someone was staying here.
		누군가 여기 머물렀군요 
00:28:43	 
		 
00:28:43	Yeah. Recently.
		최근까지요
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	Lot of sugar-free stuff.
		전부 무설탕 제품인데 
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	O'Brien was a diabetic.
		오브라이언이 당뇨였죠
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	He could have been here,
		right?
		여기 있었을 수도 있네요
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	How would he end up here?
		왜 여기까지 들어왔을까요?
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:50	Well, a lot of people knew
		these cabins were empty.
		여기 방갈로가 리노베이션 중이란건 알려져 있었으니 
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	Not a bad place
		to hide out.
		숨기엔 적당했겠죠
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:56	- You think he witnessed the murders?
		- Maybe.
		- 범행을 목격했을까요?
		- 아마도요
00:28:58	 
		 
00:29:00	Maybe.
		아마도
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:01	Question is,
		where is he now?
		그럼 지금 어딨을까요?
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:09	But the roadblocks
		are still up, right?
		아직 도로 검문 하고 있죠?
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:10	Let us know
		if you get a hit.
		걸리거든 연락줘요
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	Nothing on O'Brien
		from the airport,
		공항이나 버스 터미널 
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	bus station,
		or the train station.
		기차역에서도 아직 얘기가 없어
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	Hey. Welcome back.
		돌아왔어요?
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:21	Doctors say
		what the problem is?
		의사가 그래서 뭐래요?
00:29:23	 
		 
00:29:23	Yeah.
		어
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:24	I got hit by a car.
		나더러 차에 치었대 
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	Hey, Cho.
		Good to have you back.
		조, 돌아와서 기쁘다
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	Thanks.
		감사합니다 
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	I just got a call
		from a ranger.
		산림청에서 전화가 왔는데 
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:31	He spotted a man driving down
		black canyon fire road
		페어몬트에서 30마일 외곽의 
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	30 miles outside of Fairmont.
		블랙 캐넌 소방도로를 지나치는 남자를 봤대
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	Caucasian, male, 50s,
		grey-haired.
		50대 백인 남자고 머리가 세었대
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	Sounds like O'Brien.
		We're on it.
		오브라이언 같은데 가보자
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:40	Uh, Van Pelt,
		반펠트, 
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:41	why don't you go with Rigsby?
		릭스비랑 같이 갈래?
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:51	Uh, about a mile up ahead
		turn right onto the fire road.
		한 마일 정도 더 가서 오른쪽으로 꺾어
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	Okay.
		응
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:59	Lisbon's niece... sharp girl.
		반장님 조카, 애가 야무지던데 
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	Yeah, I guess.
		그렇더라
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	Yeah. Good questions.
		질문도 날카롭고
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	Yeah.
		응
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	Do you love her?
		사랑해?
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:07	What, Annabeth?
		뭐, 애너베스?
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	Your girlfriend Sarah.
		너 여자친구
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	Oh, right.
		어, 응 
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:11	So?
		그래서?
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	I don't see why it matters
		if I love her or not.
		내가 사랑하고 말고가 그리 중요한 문제인지 모르겠는데 
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	Uh-oh.
		 
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:17	Look, we have
		a good time together,
		함께 있으면 좋고 
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	we enjoy each other's company,
		I look forward to seeing her.
		옆에 있으면 편하고 또 보고 싶고
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:22	Isn't that enough?
		Why worry about it?
		그러면 충분하지 않아? 뭘 더 걱정해? 
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	Trust me,
		she's worrying about it.
		내가 장담하건대 여자는 걱정이 될걸 
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	I just think if
		you start talking like that,
		이런 주제로 얘기 시작했단 
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	you're gonna get hurt.
		너 마음만 더 안 좋아질 것 같아
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:35	I'm not sure I even know
		what that means.
		사실 사랑이 뭔지도 모르겠어
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	"I love you."
		What does that say, really?
		사랑한다고 말하는게 다 무슨 의미지?
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	I don't know, Wayne.
		나도 몰라
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	My last relationship
		didn't exactly end well.
		내 바로 앞전 연애도 안 좋게 끝났거든 
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	I'm probably not the best
		person to ask right now.
		나한테 물어볼 주제는 아닌 것 같다 
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	Fair enough.
		그렇다 치자
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:53	There's your right.
		여기서 꺾어
00:30:55	 
		 
00:31:02	What the hell!
		저거 뭐야
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	Tommy!
		토미!
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	Put the gun away, Tommy.
		Put the weapon away.
		총 내려놔요, 토미 
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	Holster it!
		총집에 넣어요!
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:17	Uh, who are you now?
		당신들은 또 누구야?
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:30	Hey, what's going on?
		어때요?
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	O'Brien won't tell us
		what he witnessed.
		오브라이언이 입을 안 열어
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:34	His lawyer won't be here
		for a while.
		변호사는 금방 오긴 어려워 
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	Let him stew. But he's a runner.
		데리고 구슬러봐 하지만 미꾸라지 같은 놈이니 
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	Keep him on lockdown.
		가둬놓고 어디 못 가게 해 
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Okay.
		네 
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:41	Boss? They just put him
		in your office.
		반장님? 동생분은 사무실에 모셔다 놨어요
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:56	I know how you got O'Brien.
		오브라이언을 어떻게 잡았는지 알아 
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	The tech guys did
		a diagnostic on my phone.
		기술자들이 내 전화기를 검사했어
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	You downloaded spyware
		내 폰에 스파이웨어를 심어놓고 
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	so you could listen
		to my conversations.
		내 통화를 엿들었다고 
00:32:05	 
		 
00:32:05	Sorry.
		미안해 
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	You couldn't get him yourself,
		so you piggybacked on us.
		혼자서는 못 잡으니까 우릴 이용한 거 아냐
00:32:11	 
		 
00:32:11	I'm broke, Rees.
		난 파산했어, 리스 
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	Alimony, rent,
		friggin' eighth grade prom.
		별거수당에, 집세에, 애 키우는 돈에
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	Can you even believe
		they have that?
		돈이 얼마나 많이 드는지 알아?
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	I needed this guy.
		나 이놈 필요해 
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	So you lied
		and cheated your own sister.
		그래서 친누나를 등쳐?
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:24	I know how this sounds,
		이 말이 어떻게 들릴진 알지만 
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	but I would really appreciate it
		if you just give him to me.
		오브라이언을 그냥 나한테 줬으면 좋겠어 
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:27	Are you out of your mind?
		너 제정신이니?
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	I need a favor.
		부탁하는 거야 
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	Do you honestly think
		I would give you O'Brien
		네가 한 짓을 보고서도 
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:33	after what you pulled?
		내가 순순히 오브라이언을 넘겨 줄 것 같아?
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	Not to mention the fact
		that he might be a witness.
		오브라이언은 내 사건 목격자일수도 있다고
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	Do you even know
		how hard it is to ask this?
		부탁하는 난 뭐 쉬운줄 알아?
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	Okay, I am doing you a favor
		by not arresting you.
		널 당장 체포 않는 것만도 내가 많이 봐준거야 
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	Now go do something
		different with your life.
		이제 나가서 좀 제대로 살아
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:45	No, you don't tell me
		how to live.
		누난 나한테 어떻게 살라고 말할 자격 없어
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	Tommy, come on.
		토미
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:48	I bust my ass every day
		내 딸 굶기지 않고 사는데만도 
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	to put food on the table
		for me and my kid by myself.
		매일매일 똥줄이 타 
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	Hey, maybe I haven't done
		quite as well as you have.
		누나처럼 폼나게는 못살아도 
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:56	But I'm doing
		the best that I can,
		난 최선을 다하는 거야
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	so don't tell me
		how to live.
		그러니까 어떻게 살라느니 충고는 집어치워
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:14	- I'm sorry.
		- Excuse me. Sorry.
		- 죄송합니다
		- 죄송합니다
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	Sorry about that.
		미안해요
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:26	Hello.
		안녕하세요
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:32	Where are we going?
		지금 어디 가는 거요?
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:33	Uh, Tommy. He's O'Brien.
		He's yours.
		토미? 이쪽은 오브라이언 가져요
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	What?
		뭐요?
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	Go get your bounty.
		But you have to leave right now.
		가서 현상금 타시라구요 하지만 지금 바로 떠나요
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	Please.
		서둘러요
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:41	Excuse me. I'm very confused.
		What is going on?
		잠시만요 제가 지금 굉장히 혼란스러운데요?
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	Uh, Annie... pick her up at
		the Ellington Inn in Fairmont.
		애니는.. 페어몬트의 엘링턴 리조트에서 찾으면 돼요
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	- Isn't she at the motel?
		- No, I got her a spa package...
		- 애니가 방을 잡았어요?
		- 내가 스파 패키지를 선물했어요
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:48	facial, massage, the works.
		She'll be waiting for you.
		마사지 받으면서 기다리고 있을 거예요
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:50	How do you know my daughter?
		내 딸아이는 어떻게 압니까?
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	Give her my best.
		안부 전해주시구요
00:33:53	 
		 
00:34:00	Lisbon.
		리스본 
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	Are you sure we can't get
		O'Brien's public defender...
		오브라이언 국선 변호사가 
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	- Lisbon.
		- here any sooner?
		- 리스본
		- 그래서 당장은 못 온단 말이죠?
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:04	No, I'll...
		아니 전... 
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:05	- What are you doing?
		- We have to leave right now.
		- 무슨 짓이야?
		- 당장 일어나야 해 
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	I need to talk to O'Brien.
		난 오브라이언이랑 얘기를 해야 한다구
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:09	Well, that might be
		a little difficult
		오브라이언이 여기 없으니까 
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:10	because he's not
		in the building.
		그것은 좀 어려울 것인데 
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:11	Why not?
		왜 없어?
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:12	Uh, I'll explain to you
		on the road.
		가면서 설명할게 
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:14	- I know a great shortcut.
		- Where to?
		- 내가 지름길을 알아
		- 어디 가는데?
00:34:17	 
		 
00:34:19	Chad, it's agent Lisbon
		from the CBI.
		채드, CBI의 리스본이에요
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	We need your help.
		도와주셔야겠어요
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:23	Yeah, sure, of course.
		물론이죠
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	There's a bounty hunter
		on his way to your hotel
		현상금 사냥꾼 하나가 딸 데리러 그쪽으로 가고 있어요
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:27	to pick up his daughter.
		He's traveling with a fugitive.
		수배자랑 같이 있는데 
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	Carmime O'Brien.
		이름은 카민 오브라이언이에요
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:31	Wait, that guy
		squatting in our cabin?
		우리 방갈로에 숨었던 사람이요?
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	- My dad was just mentioning...
		- Listen...
		- 아버지 얘기가...
		- 채드
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	Tell your father
		to get security.
		아버지한테 얘기해서 
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:36	Detain him. We'll be there
		in 20 minutes.
		그 사람 붙잡고 있어요 우리가 20분내로 갈테니 
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:55	Well, that was
		very well played.
		장담하건대 이거 먹혀
00:34:58	 
		 
00:35:01	Where is he?
		어딨어?
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	Give it a minute.
		조금만 기다려봐
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:08	There he is.
		저기 오네 
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:11	If anything happens to him...
		내 동생한테 무슨 일만 생겼담.. 
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	Everyone's safe,
		so don't worry.
		아무 일 없어, 걱정마 
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	It's all gonna turn out fine.
		해피엔딩으로 끝날 거라구
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:25	Shall we?
		가볼까?
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:38	You're the bounty hunter, right?
		당신이 현상금 사냥꾼 맞죠?
00:35:39	 
		 
00:35:39	Excuse me?
		네?
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	This is about your bounty.
		당신 사건이랑 상관있어요
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:44	Oh, man.
		이런
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:51	Hey, I don't have time.
		저 시간 없어요
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	Listen, I just need you
		to take O'Brien to Mexico
		오브라이언을 멕시코로 데려가 
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	and let him loose.
		그냥 놔주세요
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	You do that, whatever they're
		paying you, I'll double it.
		그래만 주시면 현상금의 두배를 드릴게요
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	What?
		네?
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:01	Exactly what I said...
		I'll double your bounty.
		현상금의 두배를 드린다구요
00:36:04	 
		 
00:36:04	I don't do that.
		그럴 순 없어요
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:06	Fine, I'll triple it.
		알았어요 세배로 드릴게요
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	Why?
		왜요?
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	Look, it doesn't matter.
		Will you do it?
		이유가 중요해요? 할 거예요?
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	You killed chief Green
		and the druggie, didn't you?
		당신이 그린 소장과 마약쟁이를 죽인거지?
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	You're worried O'Brien
		can identify you.
		오브라이언이 당신을 알아볼까봐 이러지?
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	Just... just name your price.
		그냥 액수나 불러요
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	A million bucks.
		백만
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	- Come on. That's not even...
		- Whoa!
		이봐요, 
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	Might need your daddy's
		checkbook for that.
		아빠 수표책을 가져와야겠네 
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	Why? What's going on?
		뭐야? 어떻게 되가는거야?
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	O'Brien didn't witness anything.
		He was nowhere near the cabin.
		오브라이언은 증언 안해 애당초 거기 있지도 않았거든 
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	But you were, weren't you?
		하지만 대신 당신이 있었지 
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	No. I... why would you say that?
		무슨 근거로 그런 말을? 
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	Well, you gave us
		that videotape so easily.
		cctv 영상을 너무 쉽게 내줬어
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:39	Practically handed us
		Zubov as a suspect,
		우리가 주코브를 의심하게 하려고
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	and then there's the drugs.
		그리고 약 
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	A little partial to the cocaine,
		aren't you, Chad?
		당신 코카인 좀 빨지? 
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:50	No, I'm not.
		아닌데 
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:51	Okay, a lot partial.
		그렇잖아 
00:36:52	 
		 
00:36:52	Dilated pupils, hyper-alert.
		동공 확장, 심신 긴장, 
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	You're burning up.
		체온도 높아지고
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	That's why you have this, uh,
		personal air conditioner
		그러니까 안 그래도 싸늘한 방에서 
00:36:59	 
		 
00:36:59	in an already-cool room.
		혼자 에어컨을 끼고 살지 
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	And when I shook your hand,
		그리고 악수할때 보니 
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	your pulse was thumping
		like a jackhammer, my friend.
		맥박이 착암기 수준으로 쿵쾅쿵쾅거리던데 
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	Okay. Stay there!
		꼼짝마!
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:07	Chad, let him go.
		채드, 그 사람 놔줘
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:09	Stay there!
		꼼짝마라고!
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:15	Don't be stupid, Chad.
		Let him go.
		채드, 바보같이 굴지 말아
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:20	Stay back or I'll shoot him!
		물러서지 않으면 쏠거야!
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	I swear to God
		I'll shoot him!
		거짓말 아니라 쏠거라고!
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:38	Nicely done, Lisbon family.
		과연 리스본 패밀리, 장하구나
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:52	Our attorney
		will be here soon.
		변호사가 곧 올 거요
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	- What's the point?
		- Son...
		- 그래서요?
		- 얘야...
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	I just wanna
		be done with it.
		제가 알아서 할 거예요
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:58	When did you start
		dealing drugs?
		마약 거래는 언제부터 하셨죠?
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	A year ago.
		일년 전이요
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	Look, he doesn't
		pay me anything.
		아버지는 저한테 한푼도 쓰게 못했어요
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:07	Dealing does.
		약을 거래하면서 용돈을 좀 썼죠
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	And you were dealing
		to Steve Kasser
		살인이 일어난 밤 
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	the night of the murders,
		weren't you?
		스티브 캐서에게 마약을 팔았죠?
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:13	What happened next?
		그 다음엔 무슨 일이 있었습니까?
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	That's when the cop came by.
		경찰이 들렀어요
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	She told us to take it easy.
		우리더러 진정하라더군요
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:21	Then she started to talk
		to Steve about his mother.
		그리고 스티브한테 그놈 엄마 얘길 했어요
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	All I could think about was how
		my father was gonna disown me,
		난 순간 우리 아버지가 나랑 의절하자고 할 것 같았어요
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	how I'm gonna lose everything.
		그럼 난 완전히 망한다고
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	I was so high.
		난 약으로 제정신이 아니었어요
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:37	I put chief Green in her trunk.
		여자를 트렁크에 넣고
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	I tried to get Steven too,
		스티브도 그러려고 했는데 
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:42	but he was too heavy,
		so I left him there.
		너무 무거워서 그 자리에 놔뒀어요
00:38:46	 
		 
00:38:46	Look, I didn't wanna
		kill Steve, okay?
		스티브를 죽일 생각은 없었어요
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	I didn't wanna kill anybody,
		but I had to.
		아무도 죽일 생각은 없었지만 그래야만 했다구요!
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	That has to count
		for something, right?
		이거 참작할 거리가 되죠?
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:53	No.
		아뇨
00:38:54	 
		 
00:39:02	- Hey.
		- Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:04	The kid wanted to say good-bye.
		애니가 작별인사하고 싶대 
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:12	Give me a minute
		with your aunt, huh?
		고모랑 잠깐 얘기 좀 할게 
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	Yeah.
		네 
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	Love you.
		사랑해 
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:16	Love you, too.
		저도요
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:22	Listen, do you still
		want O'Brien?
		오브라이언 아직 필요해?
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:27	Well... yeah, sure.
		어..음 물론 
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	He's downstairs in holding.
		아래층에 구류되어 있어
00:39:31	 
		 
00:39:31	I'll have them
		release him to you.
		너한테 주라고 할게 
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:33	Wow. Thanks.
		와, 고마워 
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	This doesn't mean I think
		what you're doing is right,
		네가 하는 일에 전적으로 찬성한단 뜻은 아냐 
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	but I don't know.
		Maybe I'm wrong.
		하지만 내가 틀렸을 수도 있고 
00:39:43	 
		 
00:39:43	You got a great kid there,
		애를 잘 키웠더라 
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:45	so you're obviously
		doing something right.
		네가 아무튼 잘 하고 있단 뜻이겠지 
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:51	I'm proud of you, Tommy.
		네가 자랑스럽다, 토미 
00:39:53	 
		 
00:39:53	Maybe even a little envious.
		네가 좀 부러운 것 같기도 해 
00:39:57	 
		 
00:40:00	Thanks, Rees.
		고마워, 리스
00:40:02	 
		 
00:40:10	I love you, Tommy.
		사랑한다, 토미 
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	And, um, you know that
		I'm always here for you, right?
		네가 필요하면 내가 항상 여기 있는거...알지?
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:19	Yeah, I know that.
		알지 
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:22	Okay.
		그래 
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:34	Be careful, Tommy.
		몸조심해, 토미 
00:40:35
