00:00:00	Okay, five Newtonian
		equations down.
		좋았어
		뉴턴 방정식 5개 끝났어
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	Only seven quantum mechanical
		proofs to go!
		양자역학 증명 7개만 하면 돼!
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	We are cooking
		with C-H-4.
		완전 C2H5OH 풀리네
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:07	Ohh!
		Cooking with gas.
		아 술술 풀린다고ㅋㅋ
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:10	And they're both single, fellas.
		두 분 다 왜 남친이 없을까요
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	Come on, guys.
		Can't we just have one day
		얘들아 제발 하루만이라도
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	where we respect and support
		one another?
		서로 존중하고 응원할 수 없겠니?
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	Hello, family.
		안녕, 가족
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:18	There was an incident
		this morning
		오늘 작은 사고가 있었어요
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	at our annual neighborhood
		block party.
		매년 하는 동네 잔치에서요
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Cam usually provides the
		entertainment at these things,
		보통은 이런 일엔 캠이 흥을 띄우는데
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	but he had Lily's birthday
		party, so Phil volunteered.
		릴리 생일 파티가 있어서
		필이 자원했죠
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Who needs a Fizbo
		if you can have a Philbo?
		필보가 있는데
		피즈보가 왜 필요하겠어요?
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	What?!
		이것 봐!
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	I mean, where does it end?
		세상에 
		대체 끝이 어디야?
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	It's so long!
		It's comically long,
		정말 길어!
		길어서 넘 웃겨!
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	when you think about it.
		잘 생각하면 웃겨
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	Thing is,
		Phil's terrified of clowns.
		문제는
		필이 광대를 무서워한단 거죠
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	Just thought if I was the clown,
		I wouldn't be scared.
		내가 광대가 되어 보면
		무서울 거 없다고 생각했죠
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	Like how you can't
		tickle yourself.
		자기가 간지럼 태우면
		안 간지럽듯이요
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:46	Sebastian, no!
		세바스챤, 안돼!
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	I got this!
		Sebastian!
		제가 갈게요
		세바스챤!
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	Your mom's worried
		about you, buddy,
		어머니 걱정하시잖아
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	even though there's absolutely
		no reason to be --
		여기에 전혀 무서워 할 건
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:55	Smell -- oh, God.
		건 업
00:00:57	 
		 
00:01:00	S-s-s-clowns!
		광대들!
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:03	Honey.
		여보
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	They were everywhere.
		사방에 깔렸어
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	I recognize that I embarrassed
		the family this morning,
		오늘 우리 가족에게 창피를 줬지만
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:10	but I assure you that --
		장담하건대
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:12	Phil, honey, just come on
		over here for one second.
		필, 자기야
		잠깐만 이리 와 봐
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	Just a sec.
		잠깐만
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:16	Honey, you are not the first
		person to put on a clown outfit,
		당신만 그런 것 아냐
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:20	walk into
		a hall of mirrors, and --
		광대 옷 입고 거울방 가서-
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	I guess what I'm saying is
		아무튼 내 말은
00:01:24	 
		 
00:01:24	if you think you need to do
		something to make up for that,
		뭔가 만회하고 싶은 거면
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	@@/don't@@\ think that.
		그러지 마
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	No!
		안돼!
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	Oh, my God, the computer froze!
		어떡해 컴퓨터가 멈췄어!
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	- Daddy to the rescue!
		- Um...
		아빠가 도와줄게!
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:33	Well,@@/ I@@\ feel heard.
		난 할 만큼 했네
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	Yeah, you know what, Dad,
		I-I think it's okay.
		어 아빠 괜찮을 것 같아요
00:01:36	 
		 
00:01:36	I just need to do
		a hard reset --
		하드를 리셋하면-
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	No, I don't think
		it's a reset issue.
		아니 그걸론 안 될 것 같다
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:39	I think the surge protector
		just blew.
		낙뢰 보호기가 나간 것 같아
00:01:41	 
		 
00:01:41	I am going to plug this bad boy
		directly into the wall and --
		요 녀석을 바로 벽에 연결해서-
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:48	Oh, my God!
		You fried my computer!
		아빠 내 컴퓨터를 태워버렸어요!
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:49	All of our work is gone!
		우리 작업 다 날라갔다구요!
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	Honey, calm down.
		These hard drives are designed
		진정하렴
		이 하드들은 설계상
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:52	to withstand temperatures
		of up --
		높은 온도를 견딜 수 있-
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	- Aaaah!
		- Oh, my God, it's on fire!
		오 마이 갓 불났어!

00:02:10	Damn it.
		젠장
00:02:11	 
		 
00:02:13	What is wrong?
		왜 그래요?
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	Huh? Nothing.
		엉? 아무 것도 아냐
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	You know, I totally forgot
		some of my Navy buddies
		이따 해군 동기 몇놈이랑
		시내서 만나기로 했는데
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:18	are meeting downtown later
		까맣게 잊고 있었어
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:20	for a little reunion
		at O'Brien's pub.
		오브라이언네 펍에서
		오랜만에 보기로 했었거든
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:22	Well, nothing special
		is happening here today,
		오늘 별 다른 일 없으니까
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	so you have permission to go.
		갔다와요, 허락할게요
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:25	Well, I don't really need
		your permission.
		당신 허락이 필요한 건 아닌데
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:26	Why don't you just keep quiet
		and take yes for an answer?
		그냥 조용히 알았다고 하는 게 나을텐데
00:02:30	 
		 
00:02:30	Ay, there's my handsome,
		perfect, amazing boy!
		우리 잘생기고 완벽하고 멋진 아들!
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:34	Still not going
		on the class trip.
		그래도 수학 여행 안 가요
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	Why are you being such a dummy?
		Is this because I --
		왜 그렇게 바보같이 구니?
		혹시 내가 -
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:37	Mom, I don't want
		to talk about it.
		엄마, 얘기하고 싶지 않아요
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	Why am I the only one
		in this house
		이 집에서 얘기하고 싶어하는 건
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:41	that ever wants to talk
		about things?!
		왜 나밖에 없는 거야?
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:44	Ay, papi, what is wrong?
		아이, 아가 무슨 일이니?
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:45	Not now.
		나중에요
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:48	Okay, that's it.
		이제 그만
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:50	If the men in this house
		don't start talking to me,
		이 집 남자들이
		더이상 나한테 말 안 하면
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:52	I swear to God that I will
		make life miserable
		신께 맹세코 
		인생 고달프게 만들어줄거야
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:55	for each and every one of you!
		한명도 빠짐없이 전부!
00:02:56	 
		 
00:02:57	No, not yet.
		아직은 아냐
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	Oh, don't tell me the power
		just went out!
		아 제발 정전은 안돼요
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	My Sleep Number bed is stuck
		on the nap setting.
		내 수면리듬침대가 낮잠 모드라구요
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	Calm down. This is exactly why
		I sprung for a new generator.
		진정해라 이럴 때를 위해
		새 발전기 돈 주고 산거야
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:07	Which, you're welcome,
		just kicked in.
		이제 켜졌군 감사는 됐다
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	Now, granted,
		it doesn't power everything.
		물론 다 돌리기엔 전력이 부족해서
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	I had to make some hard choices.
		어렵게 몇 가지 골랐지
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	Hmm. That's it?
		The bar and the pool table?
		그래서 고른 게 바랑 당구대예요?
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:14	The frigerator's black.
		낸잔고가 까매
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:17	Okay, Jay, you're not leaving
		제이, 중요 기기에 전력 돌려놔요
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	until you put power
		in the important things.
		그 전엔 못 나가요
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	I swear to God, don't make me
		more mad than I already am!
		진짜로 이 이상 화나게 만들지 말아요!
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:23	Can't I just do it
		when I get back?
		갔다 와서 좀 하면 안돼?
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:25	Would you stop doing that?!
		저거 좀 안 하면 안돼?
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:28	It's Lily's 8th birthday,
		릴리의 여덟번째 생일이에요
00:03:30	 
		 
00:03:30	and we had a little
		backyard party planned.
		뒷마당에서 파티를 하기로 했었죠
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:32	Hot dogs, some balloons --
		핫도그랑, 풍선들-
00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:34	you know, I mean, we really
		just threw it together.
		저희 둘이 같이 준비한 거 였어요
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	Kind of like my birthday party
		last year.
		지난번 제 생일 처럼요
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	Okay, you told me that you did
		not want me to do anything --
		그건 자기가 진짜 아무것도
		하지 말라고 해서-
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	Anyway, we were all set
		for a casual kids' party,
		아무튼, 평범한 애들 파티였는데
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:43	but then
		Lily got an e-mail.
		릴리가 이메일을 하나 받고 말았어요
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:45	She's coming! She's coming!
		She's coming! Ashley's coming!
		온대! 온대! 온대! 애슐리가 온대!
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	Ashley's coming?
		애슐리가 온다고?
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	Mitchell, Ashley's coming!
		미첼, 애슐리가 온대!
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:50	Oh, my God!
		Well, now, wait a minute.
		오마이갓 
		잠깐 있어봐
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	Ashley S. or Ashley W.?
		애슐리 S야 애슐리 W야?
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:53	 
		W! 
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:54	Ashley W.'s coming!
		애슐리 W가 온대!
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	Ashley is the most popular girl
		in Lily's class.
		애슐리는 릴리 반에서 
		제일 인기 있는 애에요
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	I mean, you invite her...
		Yeah.
		그니까, 초대야 하지만
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:01	...but you never think
		she's gonna accept.
		진짜 올 거라곤 생각도 못하는 
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	No. Something must have fallen
		through, or --
		뭔가 일이 있었을 거야 아님-
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	The point is, she decides
		who's in and who's out.
		중요한 건
		걔가 노는 무리를 결정하거든요
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	So we had to up our game.
		그래서 게임 수준을 올려야했죠
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:09	Which was a fun challenge.
		꽤 즐거운 도전이었어요
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	Yeah, considering
		it had been a while
		맞아요 
		저희가 멋진 파티를 연 게
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	since we'd thrown any sort of
		fabulous birthday party.
		하도 오래전 일이어서요
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:14	You begged me not to make
		a fuss. You said --
		네가 빌다시피 유난떨지 말라고-
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:16	Oh, because that sounds
		like me, yeah.
		어지간히 내가 할 소리 같다
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	All right.
		Once Sophie boards the bus,
		좋아요
		이제 소피만 버스에 타면
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:19	we will be on our way
		to the Princess Park,
		프린세스 파크로 출발할 겁니다
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:21	where we will all pick out
		our princess costumes!
		거기서 공주 의상을 고를 거에요!
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:26	I think Ashley's having
		a really good time.
		애슐리가 좋아하는 것 같아요
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:28	Yeah?
		How can you tell?
		그래?
		어떻게 알아?
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	She's still here.
		아직 안 가고 있잖아요
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:32	Oh!
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:32	Oh, no!
		Is it raining?
		아 안돼 비오는 거야?
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	Not to worry, sweetie.
		We have parasols.
		걱정마렴
		우리 우산 있으니까
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	Oh!
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:36	Oh...
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:38	It worked!
		돼요!
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Good. I powered up
		all your essentials.
		좋아 필수적인 건 다 돌렸으니까
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	Now I'm gonna go meet
		my buddies.
		친구들 만나러 갈게
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:42	I see my espresso machine
		didn't make the cut,
		제 커피 머신은 통과를 못 했지만
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:45	but I'll manage.
		제가 알아서 할게요
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	One of the guys I'm meeting
		was lost at sea once.
		지금 만나려는 놈 중에 한 명이
		바다에서 조난당해서
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	Had to eat a jellyfish.
		해파리로 버틴 적이 있는데
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	I'll speak to him
		of your courage.
		네 이 용기에 대해서 말하마
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:53	So, power's out.
		Had to come over real quick.
		그게, 정전이 돼서 왔어요
		빨리 말할게요
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	Phil got dressed up as a clown
		필이 광대 차림을 하곤
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	and then had a panic attack
		in a hall of mirrors,
		거울방에서 공황 발작을 일으켰어요
00:04:59	 
		 
00:04:59	so he's gonna be looking to
		overcompensate for a lot,
		해서 지나치게 보상하려고 할 테니
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	so please don't indulge
		in any of his --
		절대 뭐 하게 놔두지 말아요
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	- Hey, Jay.
		- Right here.
		- 안녕하세요
		- 왔네요
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	I remembered you had
		a generator.
		발전기가 있단 걸 제가 기억해냈죠
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	I'm just gonna upload
		a few quick files for Alex.
		알렉스 파일 업로드만 좀 하려구요
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	- Don't ask.
		- I never do.
		- 이유는 묻지 마세요
		- 그럴 일 없다
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	I can't open the jar.
		뚜껑이 안 열려요
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	Well, lucky for you
		your uncle --
		마침 잘 되었지 않니
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	brother-in-law Phil
		is here.
		필 삼촌이 있으니 말야
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	And with one mighty twi--
		한 번만 세게 돌려주면-
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	We should be...
		그러니까...
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:22	Bloop! Bloop!
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	...good to go.
		문제 없고요
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	- Oh!
		- Dad!
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	- No!
		- No, no, no, no, no!
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:27	No, no, no!
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	Dad, stop helping!
		Ugh!
		아빠! 제발 돕지 좀 마요!
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:31	- Hey, monster.
		- Hey, you.
		- 헤이, 몬스터
		- 왔어
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:35	Andy I started out
		pretty hot and heavy,
		앤디랑 제가 시작은 꽤 뜨거웠는데요
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	but, uh, the last few weeks
		I've just been super busy,
		제가 요 몇 주 동안 엄청 바빠서
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	so I guess he's feeling
		neglected,
		소홀했다고 느끼는지
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	and he's acting a little cold.
		좀 쌀쌀맞게 굴어요
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	I mean, a chuck on the arm?
		팔로 툭툭치다니 참나
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	What are we,
		Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer?
		우리가 뭐, 
		허클베리 핀이랑 톰 소여도 아니고
00:05:46	 
		 
00:05:48	Those are people, right?
		걔네 사람 맞죠?
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:52	Ay, there's a puddle!
		물이 고였잖아!
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	Stella or Joe.
		스텔라 아님 조야
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:55	I'll see you
		in a couple of hours.
		두 시간 후에 올게
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	No, no, no, no!
		Look, it's a leak,
		아뇨 아뇨
		물이 새는 거예요
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	because it's coming
		through the wall.
		벽을 뚫고 나오잖아요
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Most likely
		your gutters backed up.
		빗물받이가 막힌 것 같네요
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	Consider it handled.
		바로 처리하죠
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	Please don't ask me.
		Please don't ask me.
		제발 난 빼줘
		제발 난 빼줘
00:06:03	 
		 
00:06:03	Luke!
		To the gutters!
		루크!
		빗물받이로!
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:09	Okay, princesses,
		your castle awaits!
		공주님들
		성이 기다리고 있어요!
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	What gives?
		이건 또 뭐냐?
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	The roads were starting
		to flood,
		도로에 물이 불어나서
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	so we were hoping to ride out
		the storm here.
		여기서 비바람 좀 버텨보려고요
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Yeah, sure.
		그래
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	Also, Dad, we're hoping to keep
		the princess theme alive,
		참 공주님 테마는 
		계속 살려가려고 하거든요
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	so if you could pretend
		to be a --
		그러니까 아빠가 약간만-
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	Interested?
		No.
		관심있는 척 하라고?
		싫다
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Okay.
		그래요
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	Ladies, it's costume time!
		We have...
		숙녀분들! 옷 고를 시간이에요!
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	Costumes!
		여기..
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	...Belle, we have Elsa,
		we have Ariel!
		벨도 있고, 엘사
		인어공주도 있어요
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	Costumes?
		의상?
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	Ew, costumes.
		의상이래 윽
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	What are we, 5?
		우리가 뭐 다섯살인 줄 아나?
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	Okay.
		그 그래
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	Uh, okay, so, that's happening.
		이렇게 되는 거로군
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	Hey, Ashley hates the costumes.
		애슐리가 공주 옷 싫대요
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	You got to think
		of something else!
		뭐 다른 거 생각해내야 돼요!
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:40	- What do we do?
		- Well, I don't know.
		- 뭐하지?
		- 몰라
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	Our friends are basically
		8-year-old girls.
		우리 친구들 다 여덟살 소녀같잖아
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:43	What would@@/ they@@\ want to do?
		걔들이라면 뭘 좋아하겠어?
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:45	Dance party!
		댄스 파티!
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	Yeah? Yeah?
		Okay. Okay, girls.
		어때? 좋지 얘들아
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	Uh, let's get some music started
		here, huh?
		음악 트시고~
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	Oh. Oh, God, Cam,
		there's no power.
		이런, 캠, 전기가 안 들어와
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	There's Cam power.
		캠 전기가 있지
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	What...?
		뭐..?
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	What is that?
		뭐야 그건?
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	Well, had I listened to you
		and we not donated to NPR,
		네가 니 말 듣고
		공영라디오에 기부를 안 했었다면
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	we wouldn't have gotten
		this free emergency radio
		이 비상용 라디오를 
		무료로 받을 수 없었겠지
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	that we then re-gifted
		to Jay and Gloria.
		그러고 나서 이 집에 선물했었잖아
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	I wouldn't call $19 a month
		free, but okay.
		월 19달러가 무료는 아니지만
		어쨌든 좋아
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:07	All right, let's get a little

00:07:45

		으억 털이야!
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:58	What's the plan, Luke?
		어쩔 계획이냐, 루크?
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	There are no bad ideas,
		아이디어란 다 좋다만
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	but waving a metal shovel around
		in an electrical storm
		번개치는데 금속 삽을 휘두르는 건

		그건 차고에 돌려놓고 와라
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:08	Whoa, that was close!

00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	I can't believe you let him

		어떻게 애를 또 번개 맞게 놔둬!
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	Again?
		또요?
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	Don't worry about it, champ.
		걱정 마라 챔피언
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:22	I don't even think it hit him.
		번개 맞은 것 같지 않은데
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	Last time he smelled
		like aluminum.
		지난번엔 알루미늄 냄새가 났었잖아
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	Last time?!
		지난번요?!
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	Honey, your father and I

00:08:29	Okay, everyone.
		자 모두들
00:08:30	Don't feel like you have to wait
		for me to get back.
		나 기다릴 필요 없어
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	Jay!
		제이!
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:35	- The leak is growing!
		- I was just on my way back out.
		- 물이 점점 더 새요!
		- 막 다시 나가려던 참이었어요
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:38	- I'll do it.
		- But --
		- 내가 하겠네
		- 하지만-
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	Sit!
		앉아!
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:42	That's a silly excuse not
		to go to your school trip.
		수학여행 안 가려는 이유가 고작 그거니
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	Mom, I've made my decision.
		엄마, 이미 결정했어요
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	Oh. Hey.
		아 안녕
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	Hey.
		안녕하세요
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:51	What's going on here?
		분위기 왜 이래?
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	I could cut the tension
		with my machete.
		내 마셰티로 긴장의 끈 좀 끊어볼까요
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	It's so... nothing.
		정말 별 거 아니에요
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	I mean
		Manny got his robe
		매니가 가운을 입고 있었는데
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	caught in the refrigerator door,
		냉장고 문에 끼여서
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	and I may have
		accidentally seen...
		제가 그만 봤을지도 모르겠어요
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	him.
		그걸
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	Oh, you@@/ saw.@@\
		제대로 보셨죠
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	Okay.
		좋아
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	Manny, it's over.
		What happened happened.
		매니 지나간 일이야
		이미 일어난 일을 어쩌겠니
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	It's done.
		Okay?
		이걸로 끝
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	Okay, good,
		because I have a problem
		잘됐어요
		지금 문제가 있는데
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	and I need your help, Claire.
		클레어가 좀 도와줘요
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	Yes. You got it.
		What is it?
		아 그럼요 뭔데요?
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	Well, Manny doesn't want to go
		to his school trip
		매니가 수학여행을 가기 싫어해요
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	because there is a rumor
		왜냐면 소문에 애들이
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	that the kids want to go
		skinny-dipping,
		알몸으로 수영을 할 거라는데
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	and he's self-conscious
		about his body.
		매니가 자기 몸에 자신감이 없어요
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	I'm gonna pretend
		I don't understand
		왜 이 얘기에 내가 필요한지
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	why you're including me
		in this conversation.
		알 것 같지만 모른 척 할게요
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:27	I'm just saying --
		그러니까 내 말은
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	You could tell him
		since you already peeped.
		이미 훔쳐봤으니
		몇 마디 해줄 수 있잖아요
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	I didn't peep.
		훔쳐본 거 아닌데
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	Tell him that he has
		a beautiful body
		아름다운 몸을 가졌다고 얘기해줘요
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	so at least something good
		comes out of the peeping.
		훔쳐보기가 전화위복일 수도 있어요
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	Please stop saying that.
		제발 그만해요
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	When I see Luke naked,
		I am going to tell him,
		내가 루크 알몸을 보면
		난 말해줄 거예요
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:40	"Luke, you have
		a beautiful body."
		"루크, 네 몸은 정말 아름답단다"
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	"When"?
		"보면"?
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	Maybe she doesn't think
		I have a beautiful body.
		제 몸이 아름답다고
		생각하지 않으신가 보죠
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	Ohh.
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	iAy, dios mio!
		Claire, is this true?
		iAy, dios mio!
		클레어, 진짜예요?
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	No!
		Okay, I can't do this.
		아뇨!
		난 더이상 못해요
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	I'm -- I'm just gonna go ahead
		and walk away now.
		나 난 그냥 이대로 사라질테니까
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	But if a bolt of lightning
		should strike this house,
		만약 이 집에 번개라도 치면
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	you can send it@@/ my@@\ way.
		나 가는 길에 뿌려줘요
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	- Oh!
		- Oh!
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:58	Okay.
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	What -- they didn't like
		the peanut-butter sandwiches?
		왜 땅콩버터 샌드위치 별로래?
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	No. No one would touch them
		after Ashley said,
		그건 아닌데 애슐리가 
		한마디하니 아무도 손 안대더라
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	"Crunchy?"
		"바삭한 거?"
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	Sh! What are you, crazy?
		She's right there.
		쉿! 미쳤어?
		바로 저기 있잖아
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	Ugh!
		This is ridiculous.
		이건 진짜 말도 안돼
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	Are we really gonna let an
		8-year-old dictate this party?
		진짜 이대로 여덟살짜리가
		이래라저래라 하게 놔둘꺼야?
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	You know how peer pressure is.
		또래 압력이 어떤 건지 알잖아
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:13	I had an Ashley
		when I was Lily's age.
		나도 저 나이 때 애슐리같은 애가 있었어
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	She blackballed me
		from the cafeteria table,
		걔가 학교 식당에서
		날 테이블에 못 앉게 했더니
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	and then no one
		would sit with me.
		아무도 나랑 같이 안 앉았어
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:19	I had to eat outside
		with the class rooster.
		밖에서 반에서 기르던 
		수탉이랑 먹었다고
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	- And then one day --
		- Okay, if this ends in another case
		- 그러던 어느날
		- 또 저번처럼 네 동물 친구를
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	of you almost eating one of
		your animal friends, I can't.
		먹을 뻔한 일로 끝나는 거면, 안 들을래
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:27	But -- okay. This is -- this is
		what I'm gonna do.
		근데 자 봐봐 이제 이렇게 할거야
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	If we get Ashley on board,
		만약 애슐리만 동참하게 하면
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	everything else will just fall
		into place.
		나머진 전부 알아서 흘러갈거야
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	I convince juries that
		guilty people are innocent.
		죄진사람들 무죄라고 
		설득하는 게 직업인데
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	I can certainly convince Ashley
		우리 파티 아이디어 쩐다고
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	that our party ideas are dope.
		쟤 설득하는 것 쯤이야 일도 아니지
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	- Yeah, but don't say dope.
		- I won't say dope.
		- 그래, 쩐다는 말은 빼고
		- 안 할게
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	Ugh. Hey, Ash.
		안녕 애쉬
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	So, listen.
		있지
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	Oops.
		어머
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	Oh, gosh.
		Oh, good call.
		이런 
		잘봤네
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:47	Um, I'm thinking about kicking
		this party up a notch,
		이 파티 레벨을 좀 
		올려보려고 하는데 말야
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:49	more grown-up activi--
		좀 더 어른스러운-
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	Uh, i-i-it's still...
		아 아직..
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	Yeah. Yes, it is.
		My word.
		어이쿠 그렇네
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	Kind of a tweener on sizes.
		이게 사이즈가 좀 애매했거든
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:55	And we always tend to go
		smaller, don't we?
		왠지 작은 아이가 더 끌리지 않니?
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	I mean, human nature,
		am I right?
		본능이 그렇잖아, 그지?
00:10:58	 
		 
00:11:00	Anyway, um, a lot
		of high-school girls
		암튼, 요즘 여고생들이
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	are really just falling in love
		with Pictionary,
		그림 맞추기 게임을 되게 좋아하거든
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	and I sort of -- um, uh...
		Oh, gosh.
		그래서 내가 일종의-
		으 이런
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	Cam bought me this shirt,
		and I...
		캠아저씨가 사줘서 그래 
		난-
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	can't believe I just tried
		to blame Cam.
		맙소사 캠 탓으로 돌리려 했다니
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	Mitchell, take responsibility --
		You eat bread, you billow.
		밋첼, 네 책임이야
		네가 쳐묵하니 살이 찌지
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	Anyway...
		아무튼..
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	...your shirt is really nice,
		and I --
		너 옷 되게 예쁘구나 내가-
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	- Hey.
		- Yeah. Take the call.
		- 여보세요
		- 그래 전화받아
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	Nobody.
		아무도 없어
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	Bye, Ash.
		잘가, 애쉬
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:26	Hey, sexy!
		왔어 섹시남!
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	What's all this?
		이게 다 뭐야?
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	Oh, just a little something
		special for@@/ you@@\ and@@/ I.@@\
		그냥 뭐 너랑 나만의 특별한 시간
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:34	I would put those away.
		그거 멀리 치우는 게 좋을 걸
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	Joe goes crazy if you play
		with his blocks.
		네가 갖고 논 거 알면
		조가 미칠텐데
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	Maybe it's time for us
		to get a little crazy.
		우리 둘이 조금 미쳐볼 시간같은데
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:39	Come here.
		이리와
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:42	I was afraid of this.
		이걸 염려한건데
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	This is why I was trying to slow
		things down with Haley.
		이래서 조금 천천히 하려고 한거에요
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	Women are always drawn
		to me physically
		여자들은 늘 저한테 
		육체적으로 끌리거든요
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	in a@@/ very@@\ intense way.
		굉장히 열렬하게요
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Which often fizzles out
		그게 곧 흐지부지되고 말아요
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	before we have a chance
		to connect emotionally.
		감정적으로 가까워지기도 전에요
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	So...
		그래...
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Yes?
		응?
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:00	There are so many
		things about you
		내가 아직 너에 대해서 모르는 게
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	that I just don't know.
		너무 많은 것 같아
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	I feel, in the Book of Haley,
		I'm only in chapter one.
		헤일리라는 책이 있다면
		겨우 1장 쯤 읽은 것 같아
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	Turn the page for me, girl.
		페이지를 넘겨보자
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	What?
		뭐라고?
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	Would it help you to open up
		if I were to brush your hair?
		머리를 빗겨주면
		조금 마음이 열릴까?
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:14	You mean in a hot way?
		야한 건가?
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	I got us some wine.
		와인 있는데
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:19	You know what would be better?
		더 좋은 게 뭔지 알아?
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:22	Two cups of soothing green tea
		마음을 진정시키는 녹차 두 잔
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	to warm our emotional
		availability.
		우리 감정의 폭을 넓혀주거든
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	Ooh, the places we will go.
		I'll be right back.
		우리한테 딱이지
		금방 올게
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	I hope this doesn't
		sound conceited,
		잘난 척 하는 건 아닌데요
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	but@@/ everyone@@\ wants me.
		모두 절 원하거든요
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	I just knew there had to be
		a rational reason
		뭔가 이유가 있겠다 싶었죠
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	Andy was rejecting me.
		앤디가 절 거부할만한
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:38	Beth's Coast Guard uniform.
		베쓰의 해안 경비대 유니폼
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	I can't believe
		he's not over her.
		아직도 못 잊었다니 말도 안돼
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	She's a size six!
		걔 55반 입는다구요!
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	Hey!
		Who moved my blocks?!
		누가 내 블록 가져갔어?!
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:47	Okay, so, Vi equals 367 meters
		per second,
		좋아, 최초 속도가 초속 367미터고
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	and D equals .00214,
		so th--
		관경이 0.00214니까..
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Alex, did you know I was struck
		by lightning?
		누나, 내가 번개 맞은 거 알고 있었어?
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
		Not right now. Maisie, continue.
		아니아니아니아니
		지금 안돼 메이시, 계속해
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	Uh... I lost it.
		아... 까먹었어
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:59	So... can we talk
		about my thing now?
		그럼... 지금은 괜찮아?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	Okay, look, you're really hot,
		있지, 네가 정말 멋있긴 하고
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	and under the right
		circumstances,
		어떤 상황에서도
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	I could see myself making out
		with you, but --
		너랑 뽀뽀해도 괜찮지만
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	Ew.
		웩
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	But we're trying
		to re-create
		그치만 지금은 컴퓨터 작업한 거
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	all the work that we lost on the
		computer this morning, so...
		날아간 거 되살려보려고 하는 중이라서
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Also, every time
		you open your mouth,
		또, 네가 입 열 때마다
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	you let out a cloud of stupid
		over the entire room.
		방 전체에 멍청한 기운이 퍼져
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	Wow.
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	I don't want to be in here
		with you losers anyway.
		나도 루저분들이랑 같이 있기 싫거든
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	And another thing --
		그리고 하나 더
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	can we circle back
		to what Maisie just said?
		메이시 누나 방금 말한 걸로 돌아가도 돼?
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	Get out!
		나가!
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:24	- Hey. Back already?
		- Never left.
		- 벌써 오셨어요?
		- 애초에 안 갔어
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	And now the pool's a centimeter
		이젠 수영장이 넘쳐서
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	from overflowing
		right in the house.
		집안까지 들어오기 직전이야
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	I got to pump the pool.
		수영장 물을 퍼내야 해
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	Wait, wait, wait, wait!
		Jay, I want you in that bar,
		잠깐 잠깐
		바에 가보세요
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	and I need to feel like a man.
		저 남자가 되고 싶거든요
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	Let me pump your pool.
		제가 수영장 물 퍼낼게요
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	All right. One hose in the pool,
		the other one --
		좋아 호스 하나는 수영장에 넣고
		다른 하나는-
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	- Jay, shh. It's me.
		- You're right. I'll do it.
		- 제이, 저예요
		- 맞아. 내가 하지
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	No, no, no, no, no.
		I got it. I got it.
		아뇨아뇨아뇨아뇨
		제가 할게요 제가
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	Gloria, I'll be back
		in a couple hours!
		글로리아, 두 시간 뒤에 올게!
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	What the -- Son of a bitch!
		Who left the door open?!
		이런 ㅅ-
		누가 문 열어놨어?!
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	Stella!
		Stella!
		스텔라! 스텔라!
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	She probably got outside.
		밖에 나갔을 거야
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	Who the hell
		left the door open?!
		누가 문 열어놨냐고?!
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	Not me!
		나 아니에요!
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	Nope.
		저도요
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	Oh, God.
		맙소사
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	What have I done?
		나 무슨 짓을 한 거야?
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	Stella!
		Stella?
		스텔라! 스텔라?
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	All set, here, Jay!
		Working like a charm!
		다 됐어요!
		기가 막힙니다!
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	Admit it!
		인정하세요!
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	You didn't think I could
		actually -- Aaah!
		제가 해낼 거라고 생각 안 하으악!
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Aaah!
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:07	Oh, no, no, no.
		What are you doing?
		안돼 안돼
		뭐하는 거야?
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	What are you doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	Wha-- well, Phil had this
		in his trunk...
		필 차에 이게 있었어
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	...and I didn't have faith
		in your "talk to Ashley" plan, so --
		네 "애슐리와 얘기한다" 작전에
		믿음이 안 가서-
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	So you decided to go
		with Bleeding Clown?
		그래서 피흘리는 광대로 가기로 했어?
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	Well, how did your talk
		with Ashley go?
		네 애슐리랑 얘기는 어떻게 됐는데?
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	- It --
		- Is your shirt stapled?
		- 그게
		- 셔츠 스테플러로 찍은 거야?
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	Yea--
		Don't worry about it.
		신경쓰지마
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	Okay, I will not have
		our daughter eat lunch
		잘들어 
		난 우리 딸내미가
00:14:22	 
		 
00:14:22	with a rooster
		for the next year.
		내년에 수탉이랑 밥먹게 둘 순 없어
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	We have a fully-licensed clown
		right here.
		바로 여기 정식 자격증을 가진 광대가 있는데
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	And I defy any child to not be
		delighted by that!
		모든 아이들에게 그 기쁨을 선사해야지!
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	A clown.
		광대라니
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	You don't like clowns?
		광대 싫어하니?
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:34	Please.
		제발요
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:36	You know what?
		Shut up, Ashley!
		됐어
		닥쳐, 애슐리!
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:39	Jay! Jay.
		제이!
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	The water is coming inside
		the house from the pool!
		수영장 물이 집으로 들어오겠어요!
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	Of course it is.
		당연하지
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	Because Phil was supposed
		to pump it out!
		필이 물을 빼내기로 했었거든!
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	Actually,
		there's an emergency valve.
		비상용 밸브가 있어
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	At the north end of
		the pool. I know that valve.
		수영장 북쪽 끝에요
		저 알아요
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:51	I'm gonna open that valve.
		제가 그 밸브를 열게요
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	Haven't you done enough already?
		이제 그만할 때 안 됐나?
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	Please!
		I need this!
		제발!
		꼭 해야해요!
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	And who else would dare to jump
		어느 누가 지금 저 수영장에 
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	in that pool right now anyway?
		감히 뛰어들 수 있겠어요?
00:14:59	 
		 
00:15:00	Me!
		저요!
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	I'm not sure
		about the rest of you,
		너네들은 어떨지 모르겠는데
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	but I'm going swimming,
		in the rain, in my clothes!
		난 수영하러 갈거야
		빗속에서, 옷 입고!
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Pool party!
		풀 파티!
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:09	I am not gonna --
		난-
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	Can I come?
		저도 가도 돼요?
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	Um...
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	Do whatever you want, Ashley.
		마음대로 하렴 애슐리
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	Yeah.
		그래
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:16	Is she following?
		Don't look back.
		따라오고 있어? 
		돌아보지마
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:24	Everybody stand back!
		모두 물러서!
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	I opened the valve!
		제가 밸브 열었어요!
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:28	I'm happy for her.
		잘했구나
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:32	Your husband's
		outside half naked.
		남편분께서 반쯤 벗고 밖에 계세요
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:34	There's still time
		to go downstairs
		아직 시간 있으니
		내려가셔서
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	and body shame him if you like.
		창피 주셔도 될 것 같네요
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	Okay. Let's you and me get this
		over with.
		이거 끝을 봐야겠구나
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:40	Huh.
		허
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:45	Okay, you're really putting
		on mixed signals here.
		지금 굉장히 잘못된 신호를 보내시는데
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	Please stop talking.
		Okay.
		제발 그만 좀 말해
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	Of course you're insecure
		about your body.
		당연히 넌 니 몸에 자신감이 없지
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	You're a teenager.
		넌 십대야
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	It's part of the job
		description.
		업무 설명서에도 적혀있어요
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	But if this whole skinny-dipping
		thing ever even happens,
		그치만 그 알몸 수영을 
		설사 한다 하더라도
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	you have nothing to worry about.
		네가 걱정할 건 전혀 없어
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:59	- Easy for you to --
		- You're still talking.
		- 남일이라고-
		- 말하지 말라니까
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	You have nothing to worry about
		걱정할 거 전혀 없어 
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	because nobody's going to be
		looking at you,
		왜냐면 아무도 널 안 볼 거거든
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	because all those other kids
		왜냐면 다른 애들도 전부
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	are gonna be too preoccupied
		with their own insecurities.
		자기 부족한 점에
		정신이 팔려있을 거거든
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	But i-if they do?
		만약에 보면요?
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:12	You'll be fine.
		괜찮을거야
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:14	You're the most confident kid
		I have ever met,
		넌 누구보다 자신감 넘치는 아이야
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	and that is always sexy.
		그건 정말 섹시한 거란다
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:21	Thanks, Claire.
		고마워요
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:23	Mm.
00:16:25	And if this helps you
		in any way,
		도움이 되실지 모르겠지만
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	I've always found you sexy, too.
		클레어도 참 섹시하다고 생각해요
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:28	Super.
		참 좋구나
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	Oh, God.
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:38	Stop pouting!
		그만 삐죽거려요!
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	That's so not you.
		당신답지 않아요!
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:41	Who cares that you dressed up
		as a clown,
		거울속에서 광대 옷 입은 자기 보고
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	then scared yourself
		in many mirrors?
		무서워하든 말든 누가 신경써요?
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	Actually, what's even
		more embarrassing
		사실, 더 창피한 건
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	is that I thought if I ran
		into that fun house
		내가 그 곳으로 들어가서
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	and grabbed that kid,
		아이를 데려오면
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	everyone would look at me
		모두가 날 영웅처럼 봐줄 거라고
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	like the hero I always
		wanted to be.
		생각했던 거예요
		내가 늘 바랬던 것처럼 
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	Correction.
		What's most embarrassing
		정정
		제일 창피한 건
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	is everything I've done
		since then
		그 이후로 제가 한 모든 일들이
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	to try to make up
		for the first thing.
		그거 만회할려고 했던 거란 말이죠
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	What are you talking about?
		"Hero"?
		무슨 소리예요? 
		영웅?
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	You're so much more than that.
		필은 그것보다 훨씬 대단해요
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	You have flaws.
		단점이야 있죠
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	You fall down a lot.
		많이 넘어지고
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	You frighten yourself.
		자기한테 겁먹고
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	You cannot even open a jar.
		You cry all the time.
		병도 하나 못 열고
		맨날 울고
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	I'm really ready for this
		to build into a compliment.
		이제 칭찬하셔도 되는데요
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	The point is that you are
		comfortable with yourself,
		중요한 건 당신이 
		자기 자신을 편안하게 해주고
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	and you make people around you
		feel comfortable.
		주위 사람들도 편안하게 해준다는 거예요
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	They feel that they
		can talk to you.
		얘기하고 싶어지는 사람이라구요
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	That's your superpower!
		그게 당신의 초능력이죠!
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:20	Pool's drained, leaks are fixed,
		generator's running,
		수영장 물 빠졌고, 새는 것도 고쳤고
		발전기도 돌아가
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	and I'm meeting my buddies.
		이제 진짜 친구들 만나러 가
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	Why, Jay?
		Why you have to go out?
		왜요 제이
		왜 꼭 만나야 해요?
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	It's a hurricane outside!
		밖에 허리케인인데!
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	I just do.
		그냥 그래
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:31	I think you probably
		loosened it with the --
		필이 벌써 다 열어놔서-
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	Don't.
		하지 마요
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	Here's your precious uniform!
		네 소중한 유니폼 여기있다!
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:38	That's Beth's.
		베쓰 건데
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	Oh, so you admit you're still
		in love with her!
		아, 아직 사랑하는 거 인정하시네
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	What?
		뭐?
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:42	Ow!
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	Just saying "Hey."
		Hurts, doesn't it?
		그냥 인사하는 거야
		아프지, 그지?
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:47	Haley!
		헤일리!
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:49	Haley!
		헤일리!
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:50	Stop!
		What are you doing?
		멈춰!
		뭐하는 거야?
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	You won't kiss me.
		You won't even touch me.
		키스도 안 하고
		만지지도 않고
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	And then I find Beth's uniform?
		그리고 베쓰 유니폼이라고?
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	So you tell me, okay?
		네가 말해 봐
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	What do you do with it anyway?
		그건 왜 가지고 있는 거야?
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:57	You -- you -- you sniff it,
		you snuggle it,
		뭐 냄새 맡고 얼굴 파묻고
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	you put it on a coat rack
		and dance with it?!
		옷걸이에 걸고 
		같이 춤이라도 추는 거야?!
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:01	I'm sending Beth's things
		back to her,
		베쓰 물건 돌려주고 있는데
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	and I got her uniform pressed
		because I love my country.
		유니폼은 다린 거야
		난 우리나라를 사랑하니까
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	So, y-you and Beth, you --
		그럼 너랑 베쓰는 
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	There is no Beth.
		There's only you.
		베쓰는 없어
		너 뿐이야
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	I'm just trying to
		slow us down a little.
		난 그저 천천히 하고 싶었던 거야
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	We kind of started this whole
		thing off in the middle.
		어떻게 보면 우린 중간부터 시작했잖아
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:15	I just want us to
		catch up emotionally
		우리가 육체적으로 가 있는 곳까지
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	to where we are physically
		so we don't burn out.
		감정적으로도 따라잡길 원했어
		다 불태워버리지 않도록
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	We're not going to burn out.
		다 타버리지 않을 거야
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	I liked you way before
		we ever hooked up.
		사귀기 훨씬 전부터
		난 널 좋아했다구
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	I just want our relationship
		to be as good as our affair.
		난 그냥 우리 사이가 
		우리 관계만큼 좋았으면 좋겠어
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:26	I mean, we never even had
		a romantic first date.
		우리 로맨틱한 첫데이트조차 없었잖아
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	I know.
		맞아
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	Maybe we should wait
		for the perfect moment
		어쩌면 완벽한 때를 
		기다려야 할지도 몰라
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	so we can start
		our relationship right.
		우리 사이를 제대로 시작하려면
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	Something special and magical,
		like in the movies.
		뭔가 특별하고 기적같은
		마치 영화처럼 말야
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	What do
		you want me to do,
		어떻게 하라구
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	chase you through an airport?
		널 쫓아서 공항이라도 가?
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	I think we got it.
		그건 벌써 한 것 같은데
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	Oh, yeah.
		그러네
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:53	Come on!
		진짜!
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:57	A damn tree's blocking the street.
		I need my chainsaw.
		빌어먹을 나무가 길을 막았어
		톱이 필요해
00:18:59	 
		 
00:19:00	Jay, I know you didn't ask
		my advice --
		제 조언을 물으신 건 아니지만..
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	I'm glad you noticed that.
		I've been stuck here all day.
		아니까 다행이군
		여기 하루종일 잡혀 있었어
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Now, I'm going to that bar!
		이젠 그 바에 갈거야!
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	The last thing I need's
		another delay.
		더이상 미뤄지는 건 안돼!
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	Where the hell's the chainsaw?!
		톱은 대체 어딨는 거야?!
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	It's right there.
		바로 저기요
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:15	I'm not gonna get there, am I?
		못 가겠지?
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	We don't have to talk about it.
		말할 필요 없겠네요
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:21	Old Navy buddy of mine,
		Big Jake, died today.
		내 오랜 해군 동기 
		빅 제이크가 오늘 죽었어
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:26	Guys in my unit have a tradition
		우리 부대 놈들끼리 전통이 있는데
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	whereas, when one of us goes,
		the rest of us,
		한 명이 세상을 뜨면
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:31	no matter where we are,
		find the nearest Irish pub,
		어디든 간에 
		제일 가까운 아이리쉬 펍에 가서
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:36	and at 7:00,
		silently toast the fallen.
		7시에
		조용히 건배를 올리지
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:43	Started with 10 guys.
		10명으로 시작해서
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	Four of us left.
		4명이 남았어
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:49	Probably should have told
		Gloria about it,
		글로리아한테 얘기했어야 했는지도
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	but I don't know.
		하지만 모르겠네
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	We...
		우린..
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:53	We all went through
		some rough stuff together...
		참 함께 힘든 일을 겪은 사이라
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:58	Hard to talk about.
		이야기하기가 힘들어
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:20	Thanks.
		고맙네 
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:25	Phil.
		필
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:47	Why can't we remember
		this last piece?
		왜 마지막이 기억이 안나지?
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	We just had it this morning.
		우리가 오늘 아침에 한건데
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:50	Hey, guys.
		I know you're busy,
		저 바쁜 건 아는데
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	but do you think being hit
		by lightning
		번개를 맞으면 
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	can make people smarter?
		똑똑해진다고 생각해?
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:55	Get out of here.
		나가
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Huh.
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	What --
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	Yeah.
		It's probably just a myth.
		그래 다 미신이지 뭐
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	There's so much crazy stuff
		요즘은 인터넷에
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	written on the Internet
		these days.
		참 정신나간 소리가 많아요
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	Turns out, when they figured it
		out the first time,
		사실은 걔네가 처음에 풀었을 때
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	the formula was in the
		background of a selfie I took.
		제 셀카 배경에 공식이 찍혔어요
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	Anyway, if you don't think
		lightning can do that,
		암튼, 누나가 번개랑 아무 상관 없다니
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:13	it must not be true.
		사실이 아닌 거지
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	After all, you are the smartest
		people I know.
		내가 아는 사람 중에 
		누나가 제일 똑똑하니까 말야
