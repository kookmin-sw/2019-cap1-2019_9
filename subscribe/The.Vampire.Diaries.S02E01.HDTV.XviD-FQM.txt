		지난 이야기
00:00:04	previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
		 
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	For over a century, I
		have lived in secret.
		수세기동안
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	Until now. I know the risk,
		but I have to know her.
		위험한 건 알지만
		알아야 한다
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	- I'm Elena.
		- I'm Stefan.
		- 엘레나라고 해
		- 스테판이야
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	- What are you?
		- I'm a vampire.
		- 정체가 뭐야?
		- 난 뱀파이어야
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	- Why are you here?
		- I miss you.
		- 왠일이야?
		- 보고 싶었다
00:00:15	- Why are you here?
		- I miss you.
		네 전 여친
		캐더린에 대해 들었어
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	He told me about your ex, Katherine.
		 
00:00:16	He told me about your ex, Katherine.
		실연당했다고
00:00:16	He told me about your ex, Katherine.
		 
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	She broke your heart.
		 
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	That was a long time ago.
		정말 오래 전 일이야
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Why do I look like her?
		난 왜 그녀와 닮은거지?
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Our love for Katherine, it wasn't real.
		캐더린을 향한 사랑은
		진심이 아녔어
00:00:23	Our love for Katherine, it wasn't real.
		캐더린은 절대
		주문을 건적 없었어
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	Katherine never compelled me.
		 
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	It's real for me.
		나한텐 진심이었어
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
		무슨 심령술사거나
		투시력이 있는거니?
00:00:27	 
		무슨 심령술사거나
		투시력이 있는거니?
00:00:27	Technically I'm a witch.
		무슨 심령술사거나
		투시력이 있는거니?
00:00:27	Technically I'm a witch.
		 
00:00:27	Technically I'm a witch.
		정확히 말하자면 마녀야
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	That noise.
		왜 이렇게 시끄러워
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	Wait, what noise?
		뭐가 시끄럽다고?
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	Tyler!
		타일러!
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	What the hell?!
		대체 뭐야!
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:41	- We need some help over here!
		- Caroline!
		- 도와주세요!
		- 캐롤라인!
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:43	Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
		타일러, 어머니와
		얘기 나눠봤니?
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	- What is it?
		- It's your dad.
		- 무슨 일이죠?
		- 아버지 일이다
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:46	He's dead.
		세상을 떠나셨어
00:00:47	He's dead.
		날 구할 가치가 있다 생각해줘서
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	You decided that I was worth saving,
		 
00:00:49	You decided that I was worth saving,
		 
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	and I wanted to thank you...
		고맙다고 하고 싶었어
00:00:52	 
		고맙다고 하고 싶었어
00:00:52	for that.
		고맙다고 하고 싶었어
00:00:54	for that.
		 
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:58	Anna!
		애나!
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	Here. It's my blood.
		여기. 내 혈액이야
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:01	If you die with it in your
		system, you'll come back.
		체내에 흡수한채 죽으면
		다시 살아날거야
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:03	Anna's dead. I saw her killed.
		애나는 죽었어
		그 광경을 목격했다
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:05	I know you cared about her.
		네가 많이 아꼈던거 안다
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	Yeah, I did.
		맞아요
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:21	You scared me.
		깜짝 놀랐잖니
00:01:24	 
		 
00:01:24	Sorry.
		죄송해요
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:26	Is Jenna home?
		제나도 집에 있니?
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	She had to meet the fire
		chef about the building.
		건물 화재 때문에
		소방서장과 미팅이 있어요
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	She doesn't know the truth.
		이모는 사실을 몰라요
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	They've covered it up.
		비밀로 하고 있죠
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	Yeah, I know. How's Jeremy?
		안다. 제레미는 어떠냐?
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:37	Holed up in his room.
		방안에 쳐박혀 있죠
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:46	I looked everywhere.
		전부 다 찾아봤어
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:47	What do you think, someone stole it?
		누가 훔쳐간걸까?
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:49	Yeah. Someone definitely took my stuff.
		응. 누군가 내 물건을
		훔쳐간게 확실해
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:52	Can I help?
		내가 도와줄까?
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	Sure.
		그럼 좋죠
00:01:56	 
		 
00:01:56	Do you want me to pick you up?
		데리러 갈까?
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	I'm just gonna check on Jeremy
		before I go to the hospital.
		제레미 먼저 확인하고
		병원에 가야겠어
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	Can you meet me there?
		네 집에서 만날까?
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:01	- You bet.
		- Ok.
		- 그래
		- 알았어
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:02	I love you, Stefan.
		사랑해, 스테판
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:04	I love you, too.
		나도
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:09	- Katherine!
		- Hello, John. Bye, John.
		- 캐더린이구나!
		- 잘있었죠, 그럼 잘가요 존
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:18	Jeremy?
		제레미
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:20	You up?
		아직 안자니?
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:35	God!
		세상에!
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:47	Hi, I need an ambulance to 2104...
		메이플가 2104번지로
		응급차 좀 불러줘요
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:49	Behind you.
		뒤에 있어
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:51	What?
		뭐구요?
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:52	Behind you.
		돌아보라구
00:02:54	 
		 
00:03:29

00:03:53	He's ok.
		들어와도 되요
00:03:55	 
		 
00:04:00	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	He said that Anna gave him heb blood,
		애나가 피를 줬댔어
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:04	and then he took these pills.
		그리곤 약을 과복용했는데
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	And now, I mean, he looks fine,
		보기에는 괜찮아보이는데
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:08	but then again so do you.
		그러고 보니
		너도 괜찮네
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:09	So I just... I don't know.
		난.. 모르겠어
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	Come here, look at me.
		나 좀 봐
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	No, I'm fine, ok? I feel exactly the same.
		괜찮다구
		정말 멀쩡해
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:14	Should I call a paramedic
		up here? What should I o?
		응급구조사 부를까?
		어떻게 해야 하지?
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	No.
		아니
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	He's fine.
		괜찮아
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:19	So you mean I'm not a vampire?
		뱀파이어가 안됐단 말인가요?
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:23	Damn it.
		젠장
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	Don't say that.
		그런 말 하지마
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	Jeremy... Jeremy, why would you want that?
		제레미...
		왜 그걸 원하는건데?
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:28	Did you hear about Anna,
		what happened to her tonight?
		애나 얘기 들었어?
		아까 어떻게 됐는지?
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	She's dead.
		죽었다구
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	Jeremy, Jeremy, come here, sit down.
		제레미
		이리 앉아봐
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	I am very sorry about Anna.
		애나가 그렇게 된건
		참 유감이다
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	But it's very important that
		you listen to me right now.
		하지만 내 말을 듣는게
		정말 중요해
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:42	With every passing moment, Anna's
		blood is leaving your system.
		지금 이 순간에도
		체내에 애나의 혈액이 남아있어
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:44	If you tried to kill yourself right now,
		지금 자살 시도를 하면
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	you could really die.
		정말 죽을지 몰라
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:47	Hey! Do you understand me?
		 
00:04:50	Hey! Do you understand me?
		스테판
00:04:50	 
		스테판
00:04:50	Stefan...
		알아들었어?
00:04:52	Stefan...
		 
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	Yeah. I understand.
		네. 알았어요
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:56	Good.
		좋아
00:04:58	 
		 
00:05:01	What about the pills that he took?
		아까 먹은 약은
		어떻게 된거지?
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	He didn't take enough to die.
		죽을수 있을만큼
		과복용하지는 않았어
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	So Anna's blood actually
		healed him of that.
		사실상 애나 혈액이
		약효과를 줄였나봐
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	I'll be right there.
		곧 나갈게요
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	- You need to be at the hospital.
		- But...
		병원에 가봐
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	No, no, I'll stay here with Jeremy.
		아니, 제레미랑 있을래
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	No, I don't need a baby-sitter.
		난 베이비시터
		필요 없어요
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	Yes, you do.
		필요있거든
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:26	How's Caroline?
		캐롤라인은 어때?
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	She's not good, Bon.
		별로 안 좋아보여
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	We were driving and
		Tyler heard this noise.
		차에 타고 있었는데
		갑자기 타일러가 무슨 소리를 듣고
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	And he got he got like
		this migraine or something.
		머리가 깨질듯이 아프다는 거야
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	And he lost control of the car.
		그리곤 통제력을 잃었지
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	And I thought that Caroline was fine,
		캐롤라인은 멀쩡한 줄 알았는데
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	and then... and then she wasn't, so...
		알고보니 안좋더라고
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	Liz.
		리즈 보완관님
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	I came as soon as I got the message.
		메세지 받고
		바로 왔어요
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Is she ok?
		캐롤라인은 좀 괜찮나요?
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	She's in surgery it's...
		수술중이야
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	they're doing everything they can.
		의사분들이
		최선을 다하고 계셔
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	I need your help, Damon.
		네 도움이 필요하다
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	Sure. Anything, Liz.
		무슨 일이든 말씀만 하세요
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	Mayor Lockwood is dead.
		락우드 사장님이 별세하셨어
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	They thought he was a vampire.
		뱀파이어로 착각했지
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	They put him in the basement.
		요원들이
		지하실에 가뒀어
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	Mayor Lockwood was a vampire?
		락우드 시장님이
		뱀파이어였다구요?
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	No, no, no. A mistake was made.
		아니
		오해였다네
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	They said he dropped like the others
		존의 발명품을 키는 순간
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	when John's device went off, but he...
		다른 뱀파이어들처럼 쓰러졌다네
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	he couldn't have been a vampire!
		뱀파이어였을리가 없어!
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	I've known the man my whole life.
		난 평생 시장님을 알아왔어
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	And now Carol Lockwood
		is going to want answers,
		락우드 여사님은
		해답을 원할거야
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	and all I can think about
		right now is Caroline.
		하지만 난 내 딸 캐롤라인
		걱정밖에 안들어
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	And... and, um...
		게다가..
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	It's ok. Hey.
		괜찮아요
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:34	It's ok.
		괜찮아지실겁니다
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:37	Bonnie. How's Caroline?
		 
00:06:38	Bonnie. How's Caroline?
		보니. 캐롤라인은 어때?
00:06:40	Bonnie. How's Caroline?
		안좋아졌어
00:06:40	 
		안좋아졌어
00:06:40	She's weakened.
		안좋아졌어
00:06:41	She's weakened.
		 
00:06:41	She's weakened.
		 
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	They don't know if she's going to make it.
		 
00:06:43	They don't know if she's going to make it.

00:09:31	Feel better?
		기분 좀 괜찮아졌니?
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:44	- Stefan?
		- Elena.
		- 스테판?
		- 엘레나
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:49	Katherine happened.
		캐더린이 나타난거지

00:10:00	Did she say what she wanted?
		원하는게 뭔지 말했어?
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	No.
		아니
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	Woman certainly knows
		how to make an entrance.
		거하게 등장하는
		방법을 아시는군
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:06	She said she fooled one of us at least.
		'한명은 넘어가던데'라고 하던데
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	What does that... what does that mean?
		그게.. 무슨 얘기야?
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	She pretended to be Elena, too,
		나한테도 엘레나인 척 했어
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	when I showed up earlier tonight.
		좀전에 나타났을때
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	I told Jeremy.
		제레미한테 말했어
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	I can't lie to him anymore.
		더이상 거짓말 못하겠어

00:10:18	Are you all right?
		괜찮아?
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	No, I'm not all right.
		괜찮지 않아
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	I thought that with all
		the tomb vampires gone,
		무덤속 뱀파이어들이
		다 사라지만
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	- things would get better.
		- I know.
		잠잠해질줄 알았어
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	We all did.
		다들 그렇게 생각했었지
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	Katherine is in this house.
		캐더린이 집에 있었어
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	That means that she's been invited in.
		초대를 받았단 거잖아
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	- What are we going to do?
		- Move.
		- 어쩌지?
		- 이사가야지
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	Very helpful. Thank you.

		지금쯤 죽었을수 있었겠지만
		아직 무사하고
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	So clearly she has other plans.
		다른 계획이 있단 소리야
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	Right, and we need to find
		out what those other plans are
		그 다른 계획이 뭔지
		알아내야해
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	and not provoke her in the process.
		그 과정에서 신경을
		건드리면 안되고
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:46	What happened tonight when
		you thought she was Elena?
		엘레나로 착각했을때
		무슨 일이 있었던거야?
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:51	To risk another... frown line
		이미 빽빽한 이마에
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	encroaching on a very crowded forehead...
		주름살 더 늘까

00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:59	we... kissed.
		키스를... 했어
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:02	And you thought it was me?
		저인줄 알았다구요?
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	- What do you mean, you kissed?
		- Well, you know,
		키스했다니 무슨 말이야?
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	when 2 lips pucker, and they...
		 
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:10	Don't be obvious, Stefan.
		이러지 마, 스테판
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	Stefan, wait, he kissed Katherine.
		스테판, 잠깐만
		캐더린한테 키스한거야
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	Not me.
		내가 아니라
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:18	I wouldn't do that.
		나라면 피했을거야

		당신네 부보안관이 실수한거에요
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	Which makes you responsible.
		그래서 당신 책임이구요
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	- Carol...
		- Your husband is the one
		- 캐롤 여사님...
		- 고인이 바로
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	who helped John Gilbert
		execute his idiot plan
		애초에 존 길버트의
		바보같은 계획을
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	- in the first place!
		- Liz...
		- 도왔다구요!
		- 리즈
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	Someone got my husband killed.
		누군가 우리 남편을
		살해했어요
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	We're all on edge here.
		다들 예민해지셨어요
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	You suffered a great loss.
		큰 일을 겪으셨구요
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	The whole town has.
		온동네가 말이죠
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	But we have to stick together.
		우리는 똘똘 뭉쳐야 합니다
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	Ok, trust each other.
		서로를 믿으면서요
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	We'll get through this.
		같이 헤쳐나가는 겁니다
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:58	So the black sheep returns.
		검은양이 돌아오셨군
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Yeah.
		그래
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	What happened to you?
		무슨 일이야?
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	In my mind, you're 12 years old.
		내 기억에
		넌 12살이었는데
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	Well, that's 2 years older than the
		last time you saw me, Uncle Mason.
		정확히는 10살때 보고
		못봤잖아, 메이슨 락우드
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:16	Good to see you again.
		보게 되서 반갑다
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	It's good to see you, too.
		나도
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	Come inside.
		들어와
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:27	Ready for this?
		준비됐니?
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:39	John?
		존 삼촌?
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:47	I'm Elena, I'm not... I'm not Katherine.
		엘레나에요
		난.. 캐더린이 아녜요
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:50	We know she did this to you.
		캐더린이 이렇게 한거 알아요
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	We need to know why.
		이유를 알아야겠어요
00:14:54	Where is she?
		이유를 알아야겠어요
00:14:54	Where is she?
		 
00:14:54	Where is she?
		캐더린은 어디있어?
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	You tell us.
		삼촌이 말해주세요
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:14:59	 
		 
00:15:02	You're a little too
		weak to play tough guy.
		강한척 하기엔
		지금 너무 약해요
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Why don't you just sit back,
		그냥 다시 누워서
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	answer a few questions.
		몇가지 질문에 답변 좀 해줘요
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:14	Please.
		제발요
00:15:16	 
		 
00:15:16	Tell us why she's here.
		캐더린이 왜 왔는지 말해줘요
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	What does she want?
		뭘 원하는거죠?
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:24	She'll try again.
		다시 시도할거야
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	We can't help you if you don't
		우리한테 털어놓지 않으면
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	confide in us.
		도와드릴수 없어요
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	In you?
		널 믿으라고?
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:34	In your daughter, then.
		그럼 당신 따님을 믿으세요
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	My daughter should have driven a
		stake through your heart by now.
		내 딸은 바로 지금
		자네 심장을 찔렀어야 했지
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:45	I haven't spoken with Katherine directly.
		난 캐더린과 직접
		얘기 못했어
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	She never trusted me.
		날 절대 믿지 않았거든
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:51	So either kill me, or get out.
		그러니까 날 죽이던가 나가든가 해
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	Because I can't stand the
		sight of you with my daughter.
		너랑 내 딸이 같이 있는건
		참고 볼 수 없으니까
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:59	You see the problem with such hatred?
		그런 증오심을 품으면
		어떻게 되는지 아세요?
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	It's gonna get you killed.
		죽게 될 수 있다구요
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:18	You may be ok with dying, but
		I have a better plan for you.
		죽는게 괜찮을지 몰라도
		더 좋은 계획이 있어
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:25	You now have my blood in your system.
		이제 당신 몸 속에
		내 피가 있어
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	All I have to do is kill you.
		이제 죽이기만 하면 돼
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	Now take my advice...
		내 충고를 들어
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	leave town. Elena doesn't want you here.
		동네를 떠나
		엘레나는 당신을 원치 않으니
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	You have about 24 hours before
		the blood leaves your system.
		몸속의 피가 배출되려면
		24시간 정도 남았어
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	That's enough time to disappear.
		사라져주기 충분한 시간이지
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	Or so help me God, I will
		turn you into a vampire
		제발 내가 당신을
		뱀파이어로 만들어서
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	and I will watch you hate yourself
		지금의 당신보다
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	more than you already do.
		더욱 자학하게 만들기 전에
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:48	Clock starts now.
		빨리 도망쳐
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	Who's the guy with Carol?
		캐롤 여사님과 같이 있는
		남자는 누구죠?
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	That's mayor's younger
		brother, Mason Lockwood.
		고인의 동생
		매이슨 락우드라네
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	Is he on the council?
		의회 일원인가요?
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	Like John Gilbert was when he rolled in?
		존 길버트처럼 말인가?
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	He's nothing like John.
		존하고 전혀 다르지
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	For one, he's not an ass.
		우선 싸가지는 아니야
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	He's not a believer, either.
		뱀파이어를 믿지도 않지
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	He wants nothing to do with the council.
		의회와는
		멀리하고 싶어해
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	He's too preoccupied
		finding the perfect wave.
		서핑에만 몰두하거든
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	Thanks.
		고마워요
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:16	Hey, Elena.
		엘레나
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:20	Thanks for coming.
		와줘서 고마워
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Come on in.
		어서 들어와
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:42	Hey. I just have to swing by home
		집에 들러서
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	and pick up Jenna and Jeremy
		so we can go to the Lockwoods.
		제나랑 제레미 데리고
		락우드가에 방문하려고
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	How did you leave it in there with John?
		아까 존하고 뭐했어?
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	I, uh...
		난..
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	I asked him to leave town.
		이 동네를 떠나라고 부탁했어
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	Asked?
		부탁?
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:56	You threatened him.
		협박했잖아
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	Yeah, I threatened him.
		그래, 협박했지
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Good.
		잘했어
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	I want him gone, Stefan.
		그가 사라져줬음 좋겠어
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	I know that I shouldn't feel that way,
		그렇게 느껴선 안되지만
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	but I don't want someone
		like that in my life.
		그런 사람을 내 곁에 두고 싶지 않아
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	- Or Jeremy's life.
		- I know, I know.
		- 제레미한테도
		- 알아
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:14	So what now?
		이젠 어쩌지?
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	Now...
		이제..
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:20	I need to go find Damon.
		난 데이먼을 찾아야 해
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	Please, Stefan, don't fight with him.
		스테판, 제발 싸우지 마
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	No, Elena, he tried to kiss
		you. I'm not ok with that.
		아니, 너한테 키스하려고 했는데
		괜찮을 수가 없어
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	That's not the problem.
		그게 문제가 아냐
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	Katherine is.
		캐더린이 문제지
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	She's already messing
		with both of your heads,
		벌써부터 너희 둘을
		혼란하게 만드는데
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	and Damon's not stable
		when it comes to her.
		데이먼은 캐더린이라면
		제정신이 아니니까
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	Last thing we need is to make thins worse.
		상황을 더 악화시키면 안돼
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:40	Did you know the Gilbert
		device affected Tyler Lockwood?
		길버트가의 장치에
		타일러도 영향을 받은거 알아?
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	Well...
		그럼..
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	I know it took the mayor down.
		시장님이 쓰러진것도 알지
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	Don't you want to know why?
		이유를 알고싶지 않아?
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	Yes, Bonnie, I would love to know why
		그래, 보니
		이유를 정말 알고파
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:51	a non-vampire was tortured
		by the vampire torture device
		존 길버트가 우리를 쓰러뜨리려고
		사용했던 뱀파이어 고문장비에
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	that you let John Gilbert use against us.
		뱀파이어가 아닌 인간이
		쓰러지다니
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	Speaking of your guilt, how's Caroline?
		죄책감 얘기가 나와서 말인데
		캐롤라인은 어떤가?
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	- She's much better.
		- You're welcome.
		- 많이 나아졌어
		- 천만에
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	- No, you're welcome.
		- How am I welcome?
		- 아니, 내가 천만에
		- 왜 그러는거지?
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	You'll live to see another day.
		살아남았으니 말이야
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	No good deed goes unpunished wit?
		나쁜일만 저질러도
		벌받지 않는군?
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	Doesn't undo the bad.
		그런다고 과거를
		되돌릴 수 없어
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	I know what you are,
		Damon. You might have Elena
		당신 속을 알아, 데이먼
		엘레나나
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	and the sheriff and everybody
		else fooled, but not me.
		보안관이나 모두를 속였을지
		몰라도, 나는 안 속아
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	Hmm. One wrong move,
		또 나쁜 짓을 하면
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	and I'm gonna take you out.
		가만 안둘거야
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	Now you need to stop
		with the witch's brew.
		마녀의 물약은
		그만 먹어
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	You're starting to believe your own press.
		마녀들 얘기를 믿기 시작했군
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:30	I'm sorry.
		미안
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	You were saying?
		방금 뭐라고 했어?
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:39	Oh, God.
		이런
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	Damon drives me crazy.
		데이먼 때문에 미치겠어
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	He's walking around like
		he's some kind of hero
		캐롤라인 낫게 해준거 가지고
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	for healing Caroline, when it's his fault
		무슨 영웅인냥
		위풍당당하신대, 사실은
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	all this happened in the first place
		애초부터 이 모든 일의 원인이잖아
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	I'm sorry, Bonnie.
		미안, 보니
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	What Damon's done is just awful.
		데이먼의 저지른 일들은
		정말 끔찍해
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	Better. Hateful Damon moment over.
		기분이 나아졌다
		이제 그만 증오할래
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	Thanks.
		고마워
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:04	I gotta find Tyler and pay my respects.
		타일러 찾아서
		위로해야겠다
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	I'll be back.
		곧 돌아올게
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	Ok.
		알았어
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:20	Hello?
		여보세요?
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	- Elena, where are you?
		- Bonnie, I know
		- 엘레나, 어디야?
		- 보니, 알아
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	I'm late. I'm getting in the car now.
		늦었지. 차 안에 있어
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	I'll be there in five.
		5분 안에 갈게
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:34	We haven't officially met. I'm Katherine.
		아직 서로 소개 못했지
		캐더린이라고 해
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:44	- I know who you are.
		- Of course you do.
		- 당신이 누군지 알아
		- 물론 알겠지
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	You're th best friend, right?
		단짝친구지?
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	I've been putting all the
		pieces of Elena's life together.
		엘레나의 삶을
		하나하나 훑어봤어
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	Isabelle told me it was a bit of a puzzle.
		이자벨이 조금
		복잡하다고 하더군
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	I do know who Jenna and Jeremy are.
		제나랑 제레미가
		누군지 알지
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	And I've met that
		delicious ex-boyfriend Matt,
		맛있는 전남친 맷도 만났고
00:21:00	 
		맛있는 전남친 맷도 만났고
00:21:00	who's sweet on Caroline,
		맛있는 전남친 맷도 만났고
00:21:01	who's sweet on Caroline,
		 
00:21:01	who's sweet on Caroline,
		캐롤라인도
00:21:01	 
		캐롤라인도
00:21:01	and I've met that delicious
		and then there's you,
		캐롤라인도
00:21:02	and I've met that delicious
		and then there's you,
		 
00:21:02	and I've met that delicious
		and then there's you,
		이제 네가 남았네
00:21:03	 
		이제 네가 남았네
00:21:03	the vampire hating Bennett witch.
		이제 네가 남았네
00:21:03	the vampire hating Bennett witch.
		 
00:21:03	the vampire hating Bennett witch.
		뱀파이어를 증오하는
		베넷 마녀
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	Did I do good?
		내가 잘 맞췄니?
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:14	I've been around a long time, Bonnie.
		난 정말 긴 인생을 살았어, 보니
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	You're gonna have to do better than that.
		그것보단 더 잘해야지
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:26	Nice.
		좋아
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:30	Leave her alone.
		보니는 내버려둬
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	Ok.
		알았어
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:47	What are you doing here?
		여긴 왠일이야?
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:48	After the way you treated me last night,
		지난밤 날 대했던 태도를 보고
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	I thought that a public
		place would be less violent.
		공공장소에 가면
		네가 잠잠해질것 같아서
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	Taking this a little far, don't you think?
		지나친거 같지 않아?
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:55	Elena could walk in at any moment.
		엘레나가 언제든
		나타날 수 있는데
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	But that's part of the fun, Stefan.
		그게 재미있는거야, 스테판
00:21:59	 
		 
00:21:59	Damon's here, somewhere.
		데이먼은 여기 어딘가에 있어
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	I've been avoiding him.
		피하는 중이야
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	Hey, guys.
		안녕, 여러분
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	Hey, Matt.
		맷
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	I, uh, I heard that Caroline
		was doing much better.
		캐롤라인이 나아졌다 들었어
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:11	Her recovery was practically miraculous.
		회복이 됐다니
		정말 기적이야
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	You must be so relieved.
		정말 안도했겠어
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	I am.
		응
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Thanks, Elena.
		고마워, 엘레나
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:20	His eyes are so blue.
		눈동자가 정말 파랗다니까
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	You need to leave now.
		당장 떠나줘
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:23	You're hurting my feelings, Stefan.
		내 감정을 상하게 하는구나, 스테판
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:25	Damon was much happier to see me.
		데이먼은 날 더 반기던데
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	Then again, he thought
		I was your girlfriend.
		생각해보니, 날
		네 여친으로 착각했었지
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:29	- So.
		- Katherine, I'm not doing this with you.
		그럼 / 캐더린
		난 이렇게 못해
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:33	Ok, how about we don't
		have a couple's fight
		네 친구들 앞에서
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	in front of all your friends.
		사랑싸움은 그만하자
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	Walk with me?
		나랑 좀 걸을래?
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	Just tell me what you're doing here.
		여긴 뭣땜에 온건지 말해봐
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:40	Maybe I missed you.
		네가 그리웠나봐
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	Is that an acceptable reason?
		그정도면 마음에 드니?
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:44	What game are you playing?
		무슨 게임을 하는거야?
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	- Why, you want to play with me?
		- I don't know.
		- 왜, 나랑 게임하고 싶어?
		- 모르겠어
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	How can I play if I don't know the rules?
		규율을 모르는데
		어떻게 해?
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	No rules, Stefan.
		규율이란 없어, 스테판
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Don't you remember?
		기억 안나?
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	No rules.
		규율같은건 없다구
00:22:56	 
		 
00:23:18	Looks like the whole town has turned out.
		동네 사람이 다 모인것 같다
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	Yeah, well, he s...
		그래, 고인은...
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:22	he was the mayor.
		시장님이셨으니까
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	Why don't they save it for the funeral?
		장례식때나 올것이지
00:23:26	 
		 
00:23:26	It's what people do.
		사람들은 이러는거야
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	The Lockwoods were here for
		us when we went through this.
		락우드가는 우리가
		힘들어할때 위로해줬어
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	It'll be quick. We'll drop off
		the food and pay our respects
		금방 끝날거야. 먹을것 좀
		갖다주고 위로도 하고
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:33	- and go.
		- In and out?
		- 갈거야
		- 왔다 간다고?
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	Sounds like a plan.
		좋은 생각이야
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:36	You guys go ahead. I'll, um,
		먼저 들어가봐, 난..
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	I'll be right there, ok?
		곧 따라갈게
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:41	Hey.
		데이먼
00:23:42	 
		 
00:23:42	How are you doing?
		좀 어때요?
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	Great, Elena. Walkin' on
		sunshine. Thanks for asking.
		좋아, 햇빛아래 걸으며
		물어봐줘서 고맙다
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	- Damon...
		- Elena...
		- 데이먼...
		- 엘레나...
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:50	We should be able to talk about this.
		얘기해봐요
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	Damon, we're close enough now.
		데이먼, 이젠 가까워진 사이잖아요
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	I really want to know how you're doing.
		당신이 정말 어떤지
		알고싶어요
00:23:56	 
		 
00:23:58	I kissed you, I thought
		you kissed me back.
		너한테 키스했고
		네가 응했는줄 알았어
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:00	Doppelganger hijinks ensued.
		캐더린이 날 갖고 논거지
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:03	How do you think I'm doing?
		내가 어떨거 같니?
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:05	I think that you're hurt.
		상처받았죠
00:24:06	 
		 
00:24:06	Hmm. Oh, I don't get hurt, Elena.
		상처 안 받았어
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:09	No, you don't admit that you get hurt.
		상처받았단걸
		인정하지 않는거죠
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	You get angry and covert it up,
		화를 내고 사실을 감추죠
00:24:13	 
		 
00:24:13	and then you do something stupid.
		그리곤 바보같은 짓을 하구요
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:15	You're scared.
		두렵구나
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:17	You think Katherine's going to send me
		넌 캐더린이
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	off the deep end, don't you?
		날 파멸시킬까봐
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:22	I don't need to hurt for that.
		난 그걸로 상처받을 필요 없어
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	You know, why...
		있지. 왜..
00:24:28	 
		 
00:24:30	why is it such a surprise
		내가 너한테 키스했을거란
		사실에 왜 그리 놀란거야?
00:24:31	 
		내가 너한테 키스했을거란
		사실에 왜 그리 놀란거야?
00:24:31	that I would kiss you?
		내가 너한테 키스했을거란
		사실에 왜 그리 놀란거야?
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	That's not a surprise.
		놀랍지 않아요
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:37	I'm surprised that you
		thought I would kiss you back.
		내가 응했으리라고
		생각했다는데 놀란거지
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:43	Now I'm hurt.
		이제 상처받았어
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:48	Elena!
		엘레나!
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	Bonnie, what happened?
		보니, 무슨 일이야?
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:55	Oh, hey, sorry. I was
		just looking for the, uh...
		미안해, 난...
00:24:56	 
		미안해, 난...
00:24:56	The bathroom's down the hall.
		미안해, 난...
00:24:58	The bathroom's down the hall.
		 
00:24:58	The bathroom's down the hall.
		화장실은 복도에 있어
00:24:59	 
		화장실은 복도에 있어
00:24:59	 
		 
00:25:02	Hey, look, I'm...
		있지...
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	I'm sorry about your dad.
		너희 아버지 일은 유감이야
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:07	Today's been a big day of sorrys
		오늘은 신경도 안쓰는 인간들한테
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	from people who really don't give a crap.
		미안하단 소리를 많이 듣는 날이네
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:14	I remember when my om died,
		우리 아버지가
		돌아가셨을때
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:16	I had a house full of strangers
		낯선 사람들이 잔뜩
		우리 집에 찾아와서
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	telling me what a great guy he was.
		얼마나 좋은 분인지
		말씀해주셨지
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	Anyway, I know how hard all this is.
		어쨌든, 네가 얼마나 힘든지 알아
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:23	Difference is, in your case, it was true.
		차이점이 있다면 네 경우에
		그분들 말이 진심이었지만
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	My dad was a dick.
		우리 아버지는 왕재수였어
00:25:32	 
		 
00:25:32	Yeah, yeah, he was.
		그래, 왕재수셨지
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:40	I found this in his desk.
		아버지 책상에서 이걸 찾았어
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:45	He won't mind, he's dead.
		신경 안쓸거야
		돌아가셨으니
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:48	Yeah, you know what, sure.
		그래, 물론이야
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	Why not.
		안될거 뭐있어
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:54	Hey, what's going on in here, Tyler?
		무슨 일이지, 타일러?
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:55	Nothing. Nothing.
		아무 것도 아녜요
00:25:58	 
		 
00:26:01	You got somewhere else to be?
		잠시 비켜줄래?
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:28	The Lockwoods have a lot
		more land than they used to.
		락우드가 소유지가
		많이도 늘었네
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:31	The possessions of all the tomb vampires
		무덤속 뱀파이어의 유산덕에
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	built them quite a fortune.
		아주 부자가 되었군
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	Yeah, why did you want them dead, hmm?
		그래, 넌 왜 그들이 죽길 바란거야?
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	You're the one who turned most of them.
		그들을 뱀파이어로 만든건
		바로 너였잖아
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	There's nothing more annoying
		복수심에 불타는 뱀파이어만큼
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	than a vengeful vampire, Stefan.
		짜증나는 것도 없다구
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	Just ask John Gilbert.
		존 길버트한테 물어봐
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	You haven't changed at all, have you?
		하나도 안 변했구나
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	But you have.
		하지만 넌 변했어
00:26:48	 
		 
00:26:48	You're stronger.
		강해졌어
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	Meaner. It's sexy.
		못되지고. 섹시한데
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Don't flirt with me, Katherine.
		그만해, 캐더린
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:53	I'm not Damon.
		난 데이먼이 아냐
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	I haven't spent 145
		years obsessed with you.
		난 145년동안 너만을
		찾아다니진 않았어
00:26:57	 
		 
00:26:57	Yeah.
		그래
00:26:59	 
		 
00:26:59	Based on your choice of women,
		네 여자 취향을 보아하니
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:00	I'd say otherwise.
		아닌거 같은데
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	Though I'll admit,
		나도 인정은 할게
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	it does bother me that you've
		fallen in love with somebody else.
		네가 다른 사람과 사랑에
		빠졌다는게 신경쓰인다는거
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	I was never in love with you, Katherine.
		난 널 사랑한 적 없었어
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	You compelled me.
		주문에 걸렸던거지
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	So none of my feelings were real.
		내 감정은 하나도
		진심이 아녔어
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	Believe what you want, Stefan.
		원하는데로 믿으셔, 스테판
00:27:17	 
		 
00:27:17	But I know the truth.
		하지만 난 진실을 알아
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	And deep down, so do you.
		마음 속 깊이
		너도 잘 알거야
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:21	- The truth?
		- Mm-hmm.
		- 사실을?
		- 그래
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	Well, the truth is, you're the same
		사실은 너는 예전처럼
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	lying, selfish,
		거짓말쟁이에 이기적이고
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	manipulative bitch
		that you've always been.
		교묘한 년이야
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:32	So whatever it is that you're doing here,
		네가 여기에 온 목적이 뭐든
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:34	why don't you just get
		on with it and leave town.
		그냥 빨리 끝내고
		이곳을 떠나줘
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:37	Because if you don't,
		안그러면
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	I will hunt you down and
		I will rip your heart out.
		널 쫓아서
		심장을 찌를테니까
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:45	You want to know why I'm here, Stefan?
		여긴 왜 온건지 알고싶어?
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:49	I came back for you.
		널 위해 돌아온거야
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	Well, the problem, Katherine...
		문제는 말야, 캐더린..
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	is that I hate you.
		난 널 증오한단거야
00:27:58	 
		 
00:28:02	You hate me, huh?
		날 증오한다고?
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	That sounds like the
		beginning of a love story,
		러브스토리의 시작처럼 들리는데
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	Stefan, not the end of one.
		끝이 아니라 말이지
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:22	Are you gonna be ok?
		괜찮아질까?
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	Yeah. It'll heal.
		응, 나을거야
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	That's not what I meant.
		그 뜻이 아냐
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:31	I was trying to figure her out.
		꿍꿍이를 알아내려 노력했어
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	I was playing along, I let her get to me.
		받아쳐줬지
		나한테 오도록
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:37	We tried to track her, but...
		추적해봤는데
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:38	she's gone. Ooh, cover up, Fabio.
		사라졌어
		가려줘
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	We got a crazy ex on the loose.
		미친 전여친이
		동네를 활보중이야
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	Better watch out, looks like
		Katherine's trying to steal your guy.
		조심해야겠는데, 캐더린이
		네 남친을 뺏으려고 하니까
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	That's not what's happening.
		그럴 일 없어
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:50	Isn't it? I mean, it's
		only fair, since I...
		그렇지? 공평해지잖아
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:53	went after your girl.
		내가 네 여친을
		쫓아다녔으니
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:56	I'm gonna go check on Jenna and Jeremy.
		제나랑 제레미 확인 좀 할게
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	Let me know when you guys are done.
		끝나면 알려줘
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:02	So what's it going to be, huh?
		어떻게 할거야?
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:05	Fight to the death.
		죽을때까지 싸울건가
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	Go ahead, take your
		threats, stake your claim.
		계속해봐 협박하든
		주장을 하든
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:09	I'm not going to fight you.
		싸우지 않을거야
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	Why?! I'd fight me.
		왜? 나라도
		나랑 싸우겠다
00:29:14	 
		 
00:29:14	Katherine's going to try to
		play us against each other.
		캐더린은 우리가 서로에게
		등돌리도록 유도하고 있어
00:29:16	 
		 
00:29:16	You do know that, right?
		그거 알지?
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:18	Brother, don't you worry.
		걱정마, 동생
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:19	Our bond is unbreakable!
		우리의 우애는
		끊을수 없으니까
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	We need to stay united against her.
		그녀를 맞서서
		똘똘 뭉쳐야 해
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:24	So, yes, as much as I would like
		그래, 형을 죽이고 싶은 만큼
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	to kill you, I'm not going to fight you.
		싸우지 않을거야
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	I kissed Elena.
		난 엘레나와 키스했어
00:29:30	 
		 
00:29:30	Because you feel something for her.
		뭔가 감정이 있으니까 했겠지
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	Because you actually care.
		사실상 아끼니까
00:29:34	Because you actually care.
		 
00:29:34	And I'm not going to
		come in here and destroy that part of you
		캐더린이 나타났다고 해서
		마침내 형이
00:29:34	 
		캐더린이 나타났다고 해서
		마침내 형이
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:38	that has finally, after all of this time,
		뭔가 인간다운
		감정을 느끼는데
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	willing to feel something.
		그런 인간애를
		파멸하게 두지 않을거야
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:42	She'll try to break you.
		형을 파멸시킬거야
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:44	She'll try to break us.
		우리 모두를 파멸시키려고 할거라고
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:48	And how we respond to that will define us.
		어떻게 반응하느냐에 따라
		달라질 거야
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:52	It's our choice.
		그건 우리 선택이지
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:56	So, no. I'm not going to fight you.
		그러니까 형하고
		싸우지 않을거야
00:29:59	 
		 
00:30:16	Jeremy.
		제레미
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:18	What are you doing here?
		여긴 왠일이세요?
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	I'm packing.
		짐싸고 있다
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	Leaving.
		떠나려고
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	So you figured you'd kill
		all your evil vampires,
		악한 뱀파이어를
		다 죽이고 나면
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	and then you'd leave town?
		동네를 떠나도 되겠다고
		생각하신건가요?
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	Not all, but enough.
		다는 아니지만
		충분히 죽였지
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:32	For now.
		지금은
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	Can you tell Elena I said good-bye?
		엘레나한테
		작별인사 전해줄래?
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:36	Why don't you tell her yourself?
		직접하지 그러세요?
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	You know, Jeremy, I
		was taught to hate them.
		제레미, 나는 증오하라고 배웠다
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	The vampires.
		뱀파이어들을
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	It's what I know. It's
		what your father knew.
		내가 아는거야
		너희 아버지도 그렇게 아셨고
00:30:47	 
		 
00:30:47	My father would have
		seen things differently.
		아버지는 다르게 봤을거에요
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	No, he may have done things differently,
		아니, 다른 선택을 했을지 몰라도
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	but there's no other way to see it.
		다른 관점은 가질 수 없어
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:55	That ring on your finger, the one
		that's supposed to protect you,
		삼촌 손에 껴있는 반지
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	that was my father's, right?
		우리 아버지꺼였죠?
00:30:59	 
		 
00:30:59	Yeah.
		그래
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	Then why didn't it protect him?
		그럼 왜 아버지는
		보호받지 못한거죠?
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	Why is he still dead?
		왜 돌아가신 거냐구요?
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	What happened to your parents
		너희 부모님한테 생긴 일은
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	wasn't supernatural.
		초자연적인게 아녔어
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	It was an accident.
		사고였지
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	There's nothing that
		can save us from that.
		그런 사고는 누구도
		구해낼 수 없어
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	I wonder what he'd think of all this.
		이 모든걸
		어떻게 생각하실까요
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	Of me.
		나를
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	He'd think that you're still young.
		넌 아직 어리다고 생각하겠지
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	You're still finding yourself.
		아직 네 정체성을
		찾아가는 중이라고
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	But you are a Gilbert,
		길버트가의 사람이야
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:26	and you've been exposed to
		this town's darkest secret.
		넌 이 마을의 어두운 비밀에
		노출이 되었고
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	And with that comes responsibility.
		그러기에 책임이 뒤따르지
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	I don't believe in that
		family legacy stuff.
		난 가문의 역사 같은건
		믿지 않아요
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:36	Sooner or later, you'll have to.
		곧 믿어야 할게다
00:31:39	 
		 
00:32:04	Tyler!
		타일러! 뭐하니?
00:32:05	 
		타일러! 뭐하니?
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	- I hat him.
		- Oh, don't say that!
		- 아버지가 미워요!
		- 그런 말 하지마!
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	Let go of me!
		놔줘요!
00:32:11	 
		 
00:32:11	Hey, Tyler!
		타일러!
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:13	- Get off me!
		- Hey, Tyler! Hey, hey!
		- 놔달라구!
		- 타일러!
00:32:15	 
		 
00:32:15	- I said get off me!
		- Tyler!
		- 놔달라고!
		- 타일러!
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:17	Get off me!
		비켜
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	Look at me. Look at me.
		날 봐
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	Calm down.
		진정해
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	Settle down.
		진정하라고
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:27	Oh, God.
		세상에
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:48	Very brave of you to come here.
		여기에 오다니 용감한데
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:53	I wanted to say good-bye.
		작별인사하려고
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:59	Leaving so soon?
		그렇게 금방 떠나려고?
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	I know where I'm not wanted.
		날 원치 않는데
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:03	Don't pout.
		삐죽거리지 마
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	It's not attractive on a woman your age.
		네 나이에 그러면
		매력 없어
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:07	 
		아야!
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:12	 
		뭐? 작별키스도 없어?
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	Why don't I kill you instead?
		대신 죽는게 어때?
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:18	What are you doing here?
		여긴 왠일이야?
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	Nostalgia, curiosity, etcetera.
		추억과 궁금증 때문에
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	I'm better at the enigmatic
		one-liners, Katherine.
		그런 수수께끼같은
		대사는 내가 더 잘 쳐
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:26	What are you up to?
		대체 무슨 꿍꿍이야?
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:27	Trust me, Damon. When I'm up to something,
		믿어봐, 데이먼
		나한테 꿍꿍이가 있다면
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	you'll know it.
		너도 잘 알테니
00:33:31	 
		 
00:33:33	Come on. Kiss me.
		어서. 키스해줘
00:33:34	 
		 
00:33:34	Or kill me.
		아님 죽이든가
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	Which will it be, Damon?
		어떤 선택을 할까?
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	We both know that
		한가지만 가능하단걸
		우리 둘 다 알잖아
00:33:39	 
		한가지만 가능하단걸
		우리 둘 다 알잖아
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:42	you're only capable of one.
		 
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	My sweet,
		내 사랑스럽고
00:33:46	 
		 
00:33:46	innocent Damon.
		순진한 데이먼
00:33:50	 
		 
00:34:02	That's more like it.
		바로 그거야
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:20	Ok.
		좋아
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	Wait.
		잠깐
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:24	Brief pause.
		잠깐 멈춰봐
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:31	I have a question.
		질문이 있어
00:34:33	 
		 
00:34:33	Answer it, and it's back to fires
		답해봐 그 다음에
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:36	and rocket's red glare.
		다시 열정적으로 돌아가자
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	Answer it right, and...
		맞게 답하면
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	I'll forget the last 145
		years I've spent missing you.
		145년간 널 그리워하며
		보낸 시절을 잊을거야
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:44	I'll forget...
		잊어줄게
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	how much I loved you.
		I'll forget everything
		사랑했던 시절도
		다 잊고
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	and we can start over.
		다시 시작하자
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	This can be our defining moment.
		우리의 결정적 순간이 될거야
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:52	Because we have time.
		시간이 있으니가
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:54	That's the beauty of eternity.
		그게 바로 불멸의 미지
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:58	I just need the truth, just once.
		진실이 필요해
		이번 한번만
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:00	Stop.
		멈춰
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	I already know your question.
		질문이 뭔지 알아
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	And its answer.
		답변도 알지
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:11	The truth is...
		사실은..
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	I've never loved you.
		난 당신을 사랑한 적 없어
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:22	It was always Stefan.
		늘 스테판이었어
00:35:25	 
		 
00:36:03	You scared me.
		놀랐잖아요
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:05	Just doing my part in
		the neighborhood watch.
		이웃감시를 해주는거 뿐인걸
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:09	Thanks.
		고마워요
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:11	For, um,
		그러니까
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	looking out for us. For me.
		지켜주는거요
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	That's me, your trusty bodyguard.
		난 바로 믿음직스러운
		보디가드니까
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	Calm in a crisis.
		위기에도 침착하지
00:36:22	 
		 
00:36:22	Have you been drinking?
		술드셨어요?
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:26	And you're upset.
		화도 났군요
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:27	That' not a good combination.
		두개가 다 합쳐지면
		좋지 않던데
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	No, I'm not upset.
		화는 안났어
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	Upset is an emotion
		specific to those who care.
		신경을 쓰는 사람한테나
		있는 감정이지
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	Come on, Damon. That's a lie.
		데이먼, 거짓말 하지마요
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	You care.
		신경쓰면서
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:40	You're surprised that I
		thought you would kiss me back?
		니가 키스에 응해줄거라
		생각해서 놀랐니?
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:43	You can't imagine that I'd
		believe that you'd want to?
		네가 원할거라 믿었단걸
		상상할 수 없는거니?
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	- Damon...
		- That what we've been doing here
		- 데이먼...
		- 우리가 여기 있는게
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:47	means something?
		뭔가 의미한다는 것도?
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:51	You're the liar, Elena.
		네가 바로 거짓말쟁이야
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	There is something going
		on between the two of us,
		우리 둘 사이에
		뭔가 있는데
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	and you know it. And you're lying to me,
		너도 알지
		넌 거짓말하고 있어
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:58	and you're lying to
		Stefan, and most of all,
		넌 스테판한테도
		거짓말하고 있고
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:00	you're lying to yourself.
		무엇보다, 스스로한테
		거짓말을 하고 있어
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:02	- I can prove it.
		- No...
		- 증명할 수 있어
		- 아뇨..
00:37:04	 
		 
00:37:06	Damon, don't!
		데이먼, 이러지 마요!
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:08	What's wrong with you?!
		대체 왜 이래요?
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	- Lie about that.
		- Stop it.
		- 그것도 거짓말해봐
		- 그만해요
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:11	You're better than this, come on.
		이것보단 더 나은 사람이잖아요
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:13	- That's where you're wrong.
		- No, no, no, Damon!
		- 네가 잘못됐단 거야
		- 아뇨, 데이먼!
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:15	I care about you. Listen
		to me, I care about you.
		당신을 많이 아껴요
		아낀다구요
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	I do, but... I love Stefan.
		하지만 난.. 스테판을 사랑해요
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	It's always going to be Stefan.
		늘 스테판 뿐이었죠
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	Elena, what's going on here?
		누나, 대체 무슨 일이야?
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	It's always going to be Stefan.
		늘 스테판이었다구요
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	Nothing, Jeremy. It's ok. Just...
		아무것도 아냐
		제레미, 괜찮아
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:29	just go back to bed.
		그냥 침대로 돌아가
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	No, it's not ok, Elena.
		괜찮지 않아, 엘레나
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:34	He wants to be a vampire.
		뱀파이어가 되고 싶댔지
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	No, Damon, stop it!
		아뇨, 데이먼
		그만해요!
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	You want to shut out the pain?
		It's the easiest thing in the world.
		고통을 죽이고 싶어?
		제일 쉬운데
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:42	The part of you that
		cares, it just goes away!
		감정을 다 없앨 수 있어
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	All you have to do is
		flip the switch and snap!
		넌 그냥 스위치를 딱
		끄기만 하면 돼!
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	Damon! No!
		데이먼! 안돼요!
00:37:49	 
		 
00:38:32	Your mom's out.
		엄마도
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	I think she popped a
		couple pharmaceuticals.
		약을 여러개 드셨나봐
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	I didn't mean to freak her out.
		놀래키려는 거 아녔는데
00:38:41	 
		 
00:38:42	I don't know why I get like this.
		나도 왜 이러는지 모르겠어
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:44	It's the curse of being a Lockwood.
		그게 바로 록우드가의 저주야
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:49	So how did you get the chill gene?
		삼촌은 어떻게 그렇게
		침착한 유전자를 가진거지?
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:51	I didn't.
		그런건 없어
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:53	I've just learned how to manage it.
		그냥 감정을 통제하는 법을
		배운 것 뿐이지
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:57	I don't want to be like this anymore.
		이러고 싶지 않아
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	None of us do.
		다 그래
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:01	That's why it's a curse, Tyler.
		그래서 저주라는거야, 타일러
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:09	He saw the ring, that's
		why he did it. He knew.
		반지를 보고 그런거야
		알고 있었지
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:12	He didn't see the ring.
		데이먼은 반지를 못 봤어
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	It's Katherine.
		캐더린 때문이야
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	She got under his skin.
		열을 받게 만든거지
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	She undid everything
		that was good about him.
		착한 면을 망쳐버렸어
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	There is nothing good about him.
		이젠 좋은 면이
		남아있지 않아
00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:22	Stefan, not anymore.
		스테판, 더이상은
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:25	He's decide what he wants.
		뭘 원하는지 결정한거야
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:29	He doesn't want to feel,
		he wants to be hated.
		감정을 느끼고 싶지 않아해
		증오의 대상이 되길 바라지
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	It's just easier that way.
		그게 더 쉬우니까
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:34	He got his wish.
		소원 이뤘네
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:46	I hate him, Stefan. I know.
		데이먼이 미워, 스테판
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:49	I know.
		알아
00:39:52	 
		 
00:40:00	Is he ok? Stefan, is he ok?
		괜찮아? 스테판
		괜찮냐고?
00:40:01	 
		 
00:40:01	He's ok.
		괜찮아
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:03	Shh. You're ok.
		괜찮을거야
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:07	Damon killed me. Damon killed me.
		데이먼이 날 죽였어
		날 죽였다고
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:08	Shh, it's ok.
		괜찮을거야
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:13	Oh, God.
