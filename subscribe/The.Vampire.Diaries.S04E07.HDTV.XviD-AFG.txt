00:00:00	Mystic Falls...
		I was born here.
		미스틱 폴즈
		난 여기서 태어났다
00:00:03	 
		 
00:00:03	This is my home.
		내 고향이자,
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	- And mine.
		- And mine.
		-내 고향이고
		-내 고향이다
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	For centuries, supernatural
		creatures have lived among us.
		초자연적인 생명체들은
		오랫동안 우리와 함께 있었다
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	They were vampires,
		werewolves, doppelgangers...
		뱀파이어 늑대인간
		도플갱어
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	- Witches.
		- And even hybrids.
		-마녀
		-하이브리드까지 있다
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	I'm one of them
		now... a vampire,
		이젠 나도
		뱀파이어다
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	and everything I used
		to feel has changed.
		여태껏 느껴왔던
		모든 감정이 바뀌었다
00:00:20	 
		여태껏 느껴왔던
		모든 감정이 바뀌었다
00:00:20	Feelings for him
		have been magnified.
		여태껏 느껴왔던
		모든 감정이 바뀌었다
00:00:20	Feelings for him
		have been magnified.
		 
00:00:20	Feelings for him
		have been magnified.
		데이먼에 대한 감정이
		커져서 그래
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	I can't do this,
		Elena... not anymore.
		더이상은
		못하겠어
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	I know.
		이해해
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Her brother is
		the key to finding the cure.
		치료제를 찾는데는
		제레미가 꼭 필요하다
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	I call this
		a hunter's Mark.
		난 이걸 헌터의
		표식이라고 불러
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	The more I kill,
		the more it grows.
		많이 죽일수록
		점점 늘어나지
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	It's invisible to
		anyone but another hunter.
		헌터말고는
		볼수도 없어
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	And I will stop
		at nothing...
		엘레나를
		인간으로
00:00:36	 
		엘레나를
		인간으로
00:00:36	Aah!
		엘레나를
		인간으로
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	To make her human again.
		만들기 위해서는
		무슨 짓이든 할것이다
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:41	What do you mean,
		you're not coming?
		무슨 말이야,
		안온다니?
00:00:42	What do you mean,
		you're not coming?
		 
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	I don't need to
		remind you
		말할 필요도
		없겠지만
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	that your miss Mystic Falls
		attendance record totally sucks.
		미인대회 참석률이
		엄청 구리단 말야
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	Besides,
		you're a founding family member.
		게다가 넌
		창립 멤버자나
00:00:48	 
		게다가 넌
		창립 멤버자나
00:00:48	By definition,
		you have to be here.
		게다가 넌
		창립 멤버자나
00:00:48	By definition,
		you have to be here.
		 
00:00:48	By definition,
		you have to be here.
		꼭 와야만 해
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	Elena and I
		broke up.
		엘레나랑 헤어졌어
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:52	By definition,
		I don't need to be anywhere.
		그 말은, 내가
		필요없다는 거지
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Did that sound as depressing
		to you as it did to me?
		그 말 되게 기운없게
		들리는거 알아?
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	I'm not depressed.
		난 괜찮아
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	I just want to rip
		into someone's artery
		단지 아무나 붙잡고
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:00	and feed until I can't
		breathe anymore.
		죽을때 까지 마시고
		싶을 뿐이야
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:03	Well, you can't.
		As your sober sponsor,
		안돼, 맨정신
		후원자로서
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	I'm not going to
		let that happen.
		그 꼴은 못 봐
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	Try and sublimate.
		바람직한 방향으로
		생각해
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:11	She said she has
		feelings for Damon.
		데이먼을
		좋아한데
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:15	What?
		뭐?
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:16	She can't have
		feelings for Damon.
		데이먼을
		좋아해선 안되
00:01:18	 
		 
00:01:18	He's... Damon,
		데이먼이니까
00:01:19	 
		데이먼이니까
00:01:19	and you're you,
		and I'm...
		데이먼이니까
00:01:20	and you're you,
		and I'm...
		 
00:01:20	and you're you,
		and I'm...
		넌 스테판이고
		난...
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	Revolted.
		반대야
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:25	You know, I'm gonna
		talk to her.
		저기, 내가 한번
		말해 볼게
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	I'm going to shake some sense
		into her clearly diseased brain.
		정신차릴 때까지
		머리를 쥐 흔들어 놔야지
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:30	Yeah, well,
		I don't know what good that'll do.
		그게 먹힐지
		모르겠지만
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	Elena's right.
		엘레나
		말이 맞아
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:33	Being a vampire
		really has changed her.
		뱀파이어가 되고
		사람이 바뀌었어
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	All the more reason
		you need to cure her.
		그럴수록 엘레나를
		치료해야지
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:40	Look, I got to go.
		이만 가볼게
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	Be careful
		and remember,
		조심하고
		명심해
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:43	there's sublimating
		and then there's insanity.
		바람직한 방법도 있고
		미친짓도 있는거야
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:46	I'll be fine. Bye.
		괜찮아질거야
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:54	In what world do
		the words "tell no one" mean
		입 다물랬더니
00:01:56	 
		 
00:01:56	"tell your brother and every
		teenage sycophant in town"?
		누가 떠벌리고
		다니래?
00:01:58	 
		 
00:01:58	The secret's safe.
		비밀은 안전해
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:00	No one who knows about
		the cure would endanger us.
		우리를 위태롭게
		할 사람은 없어
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:02	Trust me. You know I want to
		find it more than anyone else.
		그 누구보다 내가
		더 원하는거 알자나
00:02:04	 
		 
00:02:04	Well, then I suggest you find
		some vampires for Jeremy to kill
		널 희생양으로
		삼기전에
00:02:06	 
		 
00:02:06	before I'm tempted to
		offer you up as a victim.
		제레미한테 다른 뱀파를
		찾아주는게 좋을거야
00:02:10	 
		 
00:02:10	And try to keep this one
		to yourself, would you?
		그리고 이번엔 너만
		알고있어, 그럴거지?
00:02:13	 
		그리고 이번엔 너만
		알고있어, 그럴거지?
00:02:13	 
		 
00:02:15	 
		한글자막 누리닷
		nuridot.tistory.com
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:20	Where have you been?
		어딨었어?
00:02:21	 
		 
00:02:21	Oh, you know. Out.
		밖에
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:23	Where you going?
		어디가?
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	Out.
		밖에
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:25	Ok. I see shady
		Stefan is back.
		수상한 스테판이
		돌아왔구나
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:30	Please don't tell me that you're
		still working with Klaus.
		클라우스랑 일하는건
		아니겠지
00:02:32	 
		 
00:02:32	You obviously
		haven't heard.
		아직 못
		들었나 보구나
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:34	Elena and I
		broke up.
		엘레나랑
		헤어졌어
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:39	Oh.
		 
00:02:40	 
		 
00:02:42	Got it. Uh, well,
		I'll be quick, then.
		알았어 그럼
		빨리 말할게
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:45	So apparently if
		we want to find the cure,
		치료제를
		찾고 싶으면
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:47	we have to find
		a vampire hunter
		표식이
		완성되있을 만큼
00:02:48	 
		표식이
		완성되있을 만큼
00:02:48	who can kill
		enough vampires
		표식이
		완성되있을 만큼
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	to reveal the map
		on the hunter's Mark.
		뱀파이어를 죽인
		헌터를 찾아야해
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:52	Now, unless we want Jeremy
		to go all Connor 2.0,
		제레미가 코너처럼 되길
		원하지 않는다면
00:02:56	 
		 
00:02:56	I suggest we find
		a different hunter.
		다른 헌터를
		찾아봐야 할 것 같아
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	Ok. And?
		알았어
		더 있어?
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:00	And I was gonna
		ask Professor Shane,
		쉐인한테
		물어보려고 했는데
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	but it turns out he's
		shadier than you are.
		알고보니 너보다
		더 수상하더구나
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	Matt Donovan connected
		him and the pastor
		목사의
		통화기록을 통해
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	through phone
		records.
		쉐인이랑 관련된 걸
		맷이 알아냈어
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	Apparently the two
		were very chatty
		목사가 의회를
		날려버린날
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	the day that the pastor
		blew up the council.
		둘이서 수다를
		엄청 떨었데
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	Ah. So you're gonna
		confront Shane,
		그럼 쉐인한테 가서
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:14	threaten him, possibly kill him...
		that sort of thing?
		협박하고 아마도
		죽이겠지..?
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	Yeah, unless he tells
		me what he's up to.
		꿍꿍이를 말하지
		않으면 그렇겠지
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	What do you say?
		어쩔래?
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	We tag team?
		같이 갈래?
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	Nah.
		아니
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:23	I'd say
		you're on your own.
		형 혼자
		알아서 해
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:24	Or we could just
		blow it off, then...
		그건 집어치우고
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:27	go get drunk,
		술이나 마시고
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	brother-Bond
		over some tridelts
		형제애 좀
		뽐내볼까
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	if you...
		네가..
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:33	You know, want
		some quality time.
		오붓하게 지내길
		원한다면 말이야
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:40	Let's not pretend like
		this isn't the best day
		오늘이
		형 생애에
00:03:43	Let's not pretend like
		this isn't the best day
		 
00:03:43	Let's not pretend like
		this isn't the best day
		최고의 날이
		아닌 척하지 말자
00:03:44	 
		최고의 날이
		아닌 척하지 말자
00:03:44	of your life.
		최고의 날이
		아닌 척하지 말자
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:54	I'm your best friend,
		and I would never pick sides,
		네 친구로서
		편가르자는게 아니라
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	but are you sure
		that this is what you want?
		이게 네가
		원하는거 맞아?
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	Because Stefan
		is your soul mate.
		스테판은
		소울메이트자나
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	Sorry. Picking sides.
		미안,
		편가르기네
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	It's not like I don't
		love Stefan anymore,
		스테판을 사랑하지
		않는게 아니라
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	but I can't deny
		that ever since I turned,
		변하고나서
		거부할 수가 없어
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	my feelings for Damon
		have become more intense.
		데이먼에 대한 감정이
		갈수록 강렬해져
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:14	Yeah, I know.
		Stefan filled me in
		스테판이 말해줘서
		나도 알아
00:04:15	 
		스테판이 말해줘서
		나도 알아
00:04:15	on all the gory
		Damon details.
		스테판이 말해줘서
		나도 알아
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:17	He did?
		그랬어?
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:21	Is he ok?
		스테판은 괜찮아?
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	No. He's heartbroken.
		아니
		가슴아파하지
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	Well, what was I supposed to do?
		Lie to him?
		그럼 어떡하라고?
		거짓말 해?
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	No, but you weren't
		supposed to let Damon
		아니, 하지만 네가
		혼란스러울때
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	weasel his way into
		your confused newbie vampire heart.
		데이먼이 이점을
		취하게 하진 말았어야지
00:04:30	 
		데이먼이 이점을
		취하게 하진 말았어야지
00:04:30	Well, he did, and that's
		exactly what I am... confused.
		데이먼이 이점을
		취하게 하진 말았어야지
00:04:30	Well, he did, and that's
		exactly what I am... confused.
		 
00:04:30	Well, he did, and that's
		exactly what I am... confused.
		데이먼이 그러긴 했지
		난 지금 헷갈려
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	I need to figure out what
		these feelings actually mean.
		내 감정이 정확히
		뭔지 확실히 해야했어
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Excuse me.
		I'm a little lost.
		 
00:04:39	Excuse me.
		I'm a little lost.
		저기...
00:04:41	Excuse me.
		I'm a little lost.
		 
00:04:41	Excuse me.
		I'm a little lost.
		길을 잃은것 같아
00:04:42	Excuse me.
		I'm a little lost.
		 
00:04:42	Excuse me.
		I'm a little lost.

00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Yeah, that's right...

		미인대회 심사위원도
		하고 있지
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	In spite of being
		absurdly unqualified,
		자격이 없긴
		하지만
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	I'm apparently
		awarding a scholarship?
		장학금을
		수여하라나?
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	Inside by
		the parlor.
		응접실에서
		대기하세요
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:55	Right here?
		Mm-hmm.
		-여기?
		-네
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	All right. I'll just
		follow the scent
		스프레이 향기나
00:04:58	 
		스프레이 향기나
00:04:58	of hair spray
		and world domination.

00:05:02	He's the one

00:05:04	He's the one
		who told Damon
		 
00:05:04	He's the one

		데이먼한테 말해 준
		사람이자나
00:05:04	 
		데이먼한테 말해 준
		사람이자나
00:05:04	how to break
		the hunter's curse.
		데이먼한테 말해 준
		사람이자나
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	He's also the one
		that has Bonnie so obsessed
		보니가 마법 연습에
		사로잡힌게
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	with practicing
		magic
		저 사람
		때문이자나
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	that she bailed
		on pageant prep.
		그것때문에 미인대회
		준비도 바람맞혔지
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	And now he's judging
		miss Mystic Falls?
		지금은
		심사위원이라고?
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	Jack of all trades
		or kind of creepy?
		팔방미인인거야?
		아님 섬뜩한거야?
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	So your sister's
		making me be her date.
		엘레나가 나보고
		파트너 되달라고 했다메
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	Do I have to do
		that weird dance thing?
		그 요상한 춤도
		춰야되냐?
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	I'm pretty sure that's
		just for the contestants.
		미인대회 때문에
		그러는거야
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	I heard that you're April's escort.
		How'd that happen?
		넌 에이프릴 파트너라메
		어떻게 된거야?
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	She needed a date,
		and apparently you were taken.
		파트너가 필요했는데
		형은 찜당했다고 하더라구
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:37	Uh. Ok, let's just
		take these,
		저거 먼저 들고
		맥주 통은 이따하자
00:05:40	 
		저거 먼저 들고
		맥주 통은 이따하자
00:05:40	and we'll come back
		for the kegs.
		저거 먼저 들고
		맥주 통은 이따하자
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	Wait.
		잠깐만
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	You want to see
		something cool?
		멋진거 보여줄까?
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:57	How did you
		just do that?
		어떻게 한거야?
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Ever since I was
		"awoken" as a hunter,
		헌터로 각성한 이후로
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	I've had all this energy,
		like all the time.
		이런 힘이 생겼어
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	Jer, I think you need to
		talk to someone about this.
		다른사람한테
		말해야 될것 같은데
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	I mean, look what
		happened to Connor, ok?
		코너가
		어찌된지 알지?
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	A by-product
		of this energy
		뱀파이어를 죽이고
		싶어하는게
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	is that you're gonna
		want to kill vampires,
		부작용 때문일수도
		있자나
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:12	and you happen
		to live with one.
		넌 뱀파이어랑
		같이 살자나
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Hey, I would never
		hurt my sister.
		누나를 다치게
		하진 않을거야
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	I'll be fine.
		괜찮을거야
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:27	Paging Dr. bender.
		 
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	Paging Dr. bender, please.

00:06:48	 
		 
00:07:03	Can I help you?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	Time for a little break.
		잠시 쉬세요
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	He'll be safe
		with me.
		나랑 있으면
		안전할겁니다
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:15	Who are you?
		누구세요?
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	Why is there
		a cop outside?
		왜 경찰이
		지키고있지?
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	I'm a convicted
		murderer.
		유죄를 선고받은
		살인범이니까요
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	Are you guilty?
		네가 죽인거야?
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	Of course I am.
		당연하죠
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	Any regrets?
		후회는 하나?
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	Only that I
		got caught.
		붙잡힌게
		후회될뿐이죠
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:36	Whoa. Stop. Stop.
		멈춰
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	Those flowers go
		in the back,
		그건 뒤쪽으로
		가야지
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	as indicated by
		the floral chart
		차트에
		나와있자나
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	that you guys had plenty
		of time to memorize.
		외울 시간도
		많았으면서
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	Yeah. Thank you.
		그래 고맙다
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:46	Now, how did I know I'd find
		you at the helm of this ship?
		배를 지휘하는 모습을
		보게 될줄은 몰랐네?
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	Go away. I'm busy.
		저리가, 바빠
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	I was wondering what time
		I should pick you up tomorrow.
		내일 몇시에 데리러
		가야할지 궁금해서
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	About a quarter
		to never.
		아예 안오는건
		어때
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	I was promised
		a date
		하이브리드를
		준 댓가로
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	in return for
		one of my hybrids.
		데이트를
		하는걸로 아는데
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	Yes, a date,
		like to a movie,
		그래, 데이트
		영화보기나
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	where we don't
		have to talk
		서로 말하지
		않아도 되는거
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	and I can put at least
		3 seats between us.
		최소한 3자리는
		떨어져서 앉을거야
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	Surely the reigning
		miss Mystic Falls
		당연히 작년
		우승자가
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	won't be hosting
		the party alone.
		파티를 혼자
		진행하고 싶진 않겠지
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	And I assume
		you're not taking Tyler...
		그리고 타일러는
		포기한거라 생각할게
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	not after
		his indiscretions
		늑대인간 여자친구랑
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	with his lady
		werewolf friend.
		생각없는 짓을
		했으니까 말이야
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:18	Fine. If you insist
		on coming,
		알았어, 그렇게
		오고 싶다면
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	meet me here, 2 P.M.
		black tie optional.
		여기서 2시에 만나
		턱시도 입는게 좋을거야
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	And I already
		have a dress,
		드레스는
		준비해 뒀으니까
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	so don't even think of getting
		me so much as a corsage.
		꽃장식을 가저 올
		생각은 하지도 마
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	You understand?
		알았어?
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:31	I'll see you tomorrow,
		Caroline.
		내일봐
		캐롤라인
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	Aah! Aah!
		 
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	Scream. Let it out.
		We're on an abandoned farm.
		크게 비명질러
		여긴 아무도 없어
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	No one can hear you
		for Miles.
		아무도 듣지
		못할거야
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	Easy for you to say,
		wolf girl.
		말이야 쉽지
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	You never turned
		20 times in a row.
		연속으로 20번이나
		변한적 없자나
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	No, but I watched a bunch of
		your hybrid friends go through it.
		그치만 네 하이브리드 친구들이
		그렇게 변하는건 봤어
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	Aah!
		 
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Why does it have to
		be like this?
		왜 이렇게
		해야되?
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	Uhh! Why break every
		bone over and over?
		왜 뼈를 또 부시고
		부시는거야?
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	That's what the sire
		Bond is.
		그게 바로
		주종관계란 거야
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	You're grateful to Klaus
		because he released you
		보름마다 변신하는
		고통에서
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	from the pain of having
		to turn every full moon.
		클라우스가 구해줬으니
		고마워하는거라구
00:09:02	 
		클라우스가 구해줬으니
		고마워하는거라구
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	 
		그니까 아푸지 않을때까지
		계속 변하는거지
00:09:04	So you're gonna keep turning
		until it doesn't hurt.
		그니까 아푸지 않을때까지
		계속 변하는거지
00:09:06	So you're gonna keep turning
		until it doesn't hurt.
		 
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	Then you'll have nothing
		to be grateful for.
		그렇게 되면
		고마워할게 없을거야
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	Uh! What's in
		all this for you?
		넌 뭘 얻는데?
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	I don't hear
		bones cracking.
		뼈 부서지는
		소리가 안들리네
00:09:13

		소리가 안들리네
00:09:13	Uhh!

		더 벌어줬어
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	Klaus wants to go with her to

00:09:23	Watching Klaus
		Fawn over Caroline

		pageant?
		구닥다리 미인대회에
		가자고?
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	No, thanks.
		사양하겠어
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:27	Come on.
		그러지말구
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	Uahh!

00:09:40	Guys, like this
		isn't torture enough?
		이정도 고문이면
		충분한거 아냐?
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	Can you take it
		outside?
		밖에나가서
		얘기할래?
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:50	Fine. We'll go.
		좋아 가자

00:10:05	You need a hand?
		도와줄까?
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	Yeah. Please.
		This clasp is tricky.
		응, 잠기지가

00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:15	Hey, I, uh, picked up

00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	It's that hunter's
		Mark, jer.
		헌터의 표식
		때문이야
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	It's messing
		with you.
		그게 널 엉망으로
		만드는거야
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	What if I'm turning
		into Alaric?
		알라릭처럼 되면
		어떡하지?
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	I probably died too many times
		with this ring on my finger,
		반지를 끼고
		너무 많이 죽어서 그런걸거야
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	and I'm developing an alter ego,

		진짜? 파랑은 좀

00:12:38	See? April cares.
		Red, right, Elena?
		봤지? 에이프릴이 괜찮대
		빨강색 맞지, 엘레나?
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:43	The red is pretty.
		빨강이
		이쁘긴하지

00:12:55	 
		빨강이 싫다면서?

00:13:31	Stefan told me

		헤어졌다고
		들었어
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:36	I'd say I'm sorry,
		but I'm not.
		유감이라곤 했지만
		난 아니야
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:42	What did he say?
		뭐라던가요?
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	Oh, you know.
		Stuff.
		스테판 알자나
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	The guy just went on and on
		about it. Wouldn't shut up.
		불평만 계속 헤대지
		그만할줄을 몰라
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	So he didn't
		tell you why?
		이유는 말
		안했어요?
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	Nope, but I'm sure
		it has something to do
		아니,근데 너가 이상하게
		행동하는거 때문이겠지
00:13:56	 
		아니,근데 너가 이상하게
		행동하는거 때문이겠지
00:13:56	with you acting weird,
		so why don't you tell me?

00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	Same reason anyone

00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	There's nothing
		I can do to help you.
		그건 도와줄게
		없어요
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	Hmm. Well, why don't you
		help me with this?
		그럼 다른건
		어때요?
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	Why are you here?
		여긴 왜 왔어요?
00:15:04

		강의계획이 어떻게
		되죠, 교수님?
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:08	You think too highly

00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:13	I'm gonna go find

00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	But you knew him,
		didn't you?
		근데 목사

00:16:21	Oh, it doesn't
		really matter.
		몰라도 되
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	All that matters is

		넌 뱀파이어 헌터고
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	and he's a vampire.
		이놈은 뱀파이어라는

		거진 뱀파이어지
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:36	Aah!
		 
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:42	Was this all so
		I could stake him?
		이게 다 나보고
		죽이라고 만든거에요?
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	Do you think I want to do this,
		Jeremy? Look at me.
		나라고 이러고
		싶었겠어?
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	I hate this. I don't want
		to do this, but your sister
		나도 싫어
		그치만 엘레나가
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	isn't supposed to be
		a vampire,
		뱀파이어가 되어선
		안된다구
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	and we need to help her.
		우리가 도와줘야 해
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	He's a murderer,
		이놈은 살인마야
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	and he will gladly
		kill again,
		자랑스럽게 또
		살인을 하겠지
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	so do it, Jeremy.
		그니까 어서 해

00:16:55	Kill him.

00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:58	Stefan,
		what are you doing?!
		스테판,
		뭐하는거에요?
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	What the hell
		is wrong with you?
		대체 왜 그래요?
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	Do it, Jeremy, or I will
		rip the chains off for real.
		얼른 해, 아니면
		체인 놀거야
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:06	Do it!
		하라고
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	Aah!

00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	All right, enough.
		He's dead.
		됐어 그만해
		죽었어
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:37	Hey, why am I
		bussing your tables?
		내가 왜 서빙까지
		해야되요?
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	I said no empty
		glasses.
		빈잔은
		안된다고 했죠
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:44	Will you guys
		pick up the tempo?
		박자 좀 빠르게
		해줄래요?
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	This is a pageant,
		not a funeral.
		장례식이 아니라
		미인대회라구요
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	And how am I doing?
		난 잘하고 있어?
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	You're...
		넌...
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:55	Perfect.
		완벽해
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	Just so beyond
		annoying,
		너무 짜증나서
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	I can't even
		look at you.
		처다볼수도 없어
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:06	They didn't waste
		any time, did they?
		쟤들은 시간을
		헛되이 보내질 않는구만?
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:19	Let's just get today
		over with.
		빨리
		끝내버려야지
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:23	I can't believe
		that I won.
		내가 이긴게
		믿겨지질 않아요
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	I just want to thank
		the judges
		못된년에서 회개한걸
		알아줘서
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	for seeing past the fact
		that I'm a raging bitch.
		심사위원한테
		고맙고
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	You don't want
		to do that.

00:18:33	Those girls
		will cut you.
		쟤들이 널
		토막낼거야
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	They have nails.
		손톱으로
		말이지
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	I have claws.

		파트너들
		사이에 있겠지
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Caroline told me to

00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:11	I guess you'll do.
		오빠가 일부러
		그런거 같은데요
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:20	You lead.
		너가 리드해
00:20:21	 
		 
00:21:03	Hey, what's with
		the last-minute escort change?
		왜 마지막 파트너가
		바뀐거야?
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	Where is Jeremy?
		제레미는 어딨어?
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	I'm calling him
		right now.
		지금 전화하는
		중이야
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	He's not
		picking up.
		받지를 않네
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	Do the math. Emo teen.
		Open bar. It's fine.
		생각좀 해라, 여자애랑
		술이나 마시겠지
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	Matt said that Jeremy's
		been having nightmares
		제레미가 뱀파이어를 죽이는
		꿈을 꾼다고 맷이 그랬어
00:21:16	 
		제레미가 뱀파이어를 죽이는
		꿈을 꾼다고 맷이 그랬어
00:21:16	about killing
		vampires
		제레미가 뱀파이어를 죽이는
		꿈을 꾼다고 맷이 그랬어
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	and he's been
		hiding it from me.
		여태 나한테
		그걸 숨겼지
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:21	Relax. I'm sure
		he's fine.
		걱정마
		괜찮을거야
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	I don't know. I have a bad feeling.
		모르겠어요
		예감이 안좋아요
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	If I'm not worried,
		you shouldn't be worried.
		내가 괜찮다고 하면
		괜찮은거야
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	Let it go.
		잊어버려
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	I'll go look for him.
		내가 찾아볼게
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:32	Ok.

00:21:36	Ok. You go home.
		집에 가봐
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	I'm gonna start
		asking around here.
		여기서 물어보고
		다닐게
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	Maybe Damon's right.
		데이먼 말이
		맞을지도 몰라
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	Maybe he grabbed
		a bottle from the bar
		술집에서 술처먹고
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	and snuck off
		to the woods.
		숲으로 내뺀거겠지
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	No. Damon's
		never right.
		아니, 데이먼이
		맞았던 적이 없어
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	Damon is sneaky
		and manipulative and rude,
		데이먼은 교활하고
		남을 조종하고 예의도 없지
00:21:48	Damon is sneaky
		and manipulative and rude,
		 
00:21:48	Damon is sneaky
		and manipulative and rude,
		근데 맞았던 적은
		한번도 없어
00:21:49	 
		근데 맞았던 적은
		한번도 없어
00:21:49	but he's never right.
		근데 맞았던 적은
		한번도 없어
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	How can you not
		see that?
		어찌 그걸 몰라?
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:52	I don't know,
		but why do I think
		그건 모르겠지만
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:54	that you won't
		hesitate to tell me?
		나한테 할말이
		더 남은것 같다?
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	Fine.
		Friend-tervention.
		좋아, 친구로서
		껴들어야겠다
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:58	I think your so-called
		feelings for Damon
		데이먼에 대한
		그 대단한 감정이
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	are really starting
		to cloud your judgment,
		네 판단력을
		흐리는것 같아
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	and I don't like it,
		난 그게 싫어
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	and the thought
		of you two together
		너희 둘이 사귄다는
		생각만 해도
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	really makes me
		want to barf.
		정말로 토할것
		같아
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	Easy, love.
		You're making a scene.
		그만해
		시끄럽자나
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	Wow. Caroline,
		thank you
		캐롤라인
		참 고맙다
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	for making this
		very difficult time so much easier.
		힘든 시기에
		짐을 덜어줘서
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:18	How did I become
		the bad guy?
		어쩌다 내가
		나쁜놈이 된거지?
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	Let's get you a drink.
		술이나
		마시러 가자
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:23	I'll tell you all about
		being the bad guy.
		나쁜놈 되기에 대해
		전부 말해줄게
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	Please don't tell me
		 
00:22:27	Please don't tell me
		네가 제레미를
		미친놈으로 만든게
00:22:28	 
		네가 제레미를
		미친놈으로 만든게
00:22:28	that you've roped Jeremy
		into a world of crazy.
		네가 제레미를
		미친놈으로 만든게
00:22:29	that you've roped Jeremy
		into a world of crazy.
		 
00:22:29	that you've roped Jeremy
		into a world of crazy.
		아니라고 말해줘
00:22:30	 
		아니라고 말해줘
00:22:30	I had no choice.
		아니라고 말해줘
00:22:31	I had no choice.
		 
00:22:31	I had no choice.
		방법이 없었어
00:22:31	 
		방법이 없었어
00:22:31	Elena needs a cure.
		방법이 없었어
00:22:32	Elena needs a cure.
		 
00:22:32	Elena needs a cure.
		엘레나한텐
		치료제가 필요해
00:22:32	 
		엘레나한텐
		치료제가 필요해
00:22:32	Oh, right. So you can
		turn her back into
		엘레나한텐
		치료제가 필요해
00:22:33	Oh, right. So you can
		turn her back into
		 
00:22:33	Oh, right. So you can
		turn her back into
		그래야 널 사랑했던
		여자로 다시 바꿀수있겠지
00:22:34	 
		그래야 널 사랑했던
		여자로 다시 바꿀수있겠지
00:22:34	the girl who's still
		in love with you.
		그래야 널 사랑했던
		여자로 다시 바꿀수있겠지
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	You know, I get why you wouldn't
		want to believe it, Damon,
		왜 믿지 않으려고 하는지
		잘 알지만,
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	but she isn't
		herself anymore.
		엘레나는 제정신이
		아니야
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	Of course
		you would think that.
		그렇게 생각할줄
		알았어
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	Leave it alone, Stefan.
		여기서 그만해
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:49	How far
		did the Mark grow?
		표식이 얼마나
		커졌어?
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:55	Show me
		on this drawing.
		여기다 그려서
		보여줘
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:58	Sorry, Stefan.
		I can't trust you.
		미안하지만
		믿을수가 없어요
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	How far is it,
		Jeremy?
		얼만한데?
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	I said I can't.
		안된다고 했죠
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:05	Answer me,
		or I will make you answer me.
		대답해 아니면
		대답하게 만들거야
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:08	I'm not telling you
		anything.
		아무것도 말하지
		않을거에요
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:11	What does the Mark
		look like?
		표식이 어떻게
		생겼어?
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:14	Uh!
		 
00:23:16	 
		 
00:23:16	I guess I can't be
		compelled anymore.
		이젠 그방법도
		먹히질 않나봐요
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:30	 
		엄청나게 큰 실수를
		할때는
00:23:31	It's just,
		as her best friend,
		엄청나게 큰 실수를
		할때는
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	it is my duty
		to warn her
		친구로서 당연히
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:33	when she's making
		a giant mistake, right?
		경고해줘야 된다구
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	And now she's taking
		Damon's side on everything.
		이제는 뭐든지
		데이먼 편을 들자나
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	So being a vampire
		has changed her.
		뱀파이어가 된게
		그녀를 바꿔놨네
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:41	But being a vampire only
		amplifies who you already are.
		하지만 뱀파이어가 되는건
		본성을 극대화시키는거자나
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	It doesn't turn you into
		a completely different person.
		완전히 다른 사람으로
		바꿀순 없자나
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	Very peculiar.
		매우 특별한
		경우인가 보네
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	What's that look for?
		왜 웃어?
00:23:53	 
		 
00:23:53	It'll all make sense
		eventually.
		전부 이해가 되서
00:23:56	 
		 
00:23:56	Whatever.
		Just hurry up and find the cure.
		어쨌든지
		서둘러서 치료제나 찾아
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	I'm working on it.
		찾고 있어
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:09	Would you ever
		take it?
		치료제를 먹고
		싶었던적 있어?
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:12	Now, why would I
		want to cure myself
		지구에서 가장 강한
		생명체인데
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	of being the most
		powerful creature
		왜 치료제를 먹겠어?
00:24:16	 
		왜 치료제를 먹겠어?
00:24:16	on the planet, hmm?
		왜 치료제를 먹겠어?
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:18	So there's not
		one single moment
		인간이 되고
		싶었던 적이
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	in your whole life
		that you wanted to be human.
		단 한순간도
		없다는거네
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:27	How about you?
		넌?
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	Ha ha ha!
		 
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	Ha!
		 
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	Life used to be
		a lot easier.
		예전엔 사는게
		더 단순했는데
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	Don't you miss
		the days of being...
		이랬던 날이
		그립지 않아?
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:39	"Chair of the Mystic Falls
		beautification committee"
		미스틱폴즈
		미화위원회 의장
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:42	and the "director of the
		policemen's yearly raffle"?
		경찰을 위한
		기금 마련 감독
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	Is that my
		miss mystic application?
		내 미인대회
		지원서야?
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	Where did you
		get that?
		어디서 났어?
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:46	"When I am chosen,
		제가 뽑히면
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:48	I intend to redefine
		excellence"...
		우수함이라는 단어의 뜻을
		재정립하겠습니다
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	Now, I'm really enjoying
		your use of "when" here.
		"뽑히면"을 사용한 부분이
		정말 재밌다
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	It's very confident.
		Mm-hmm.
		자신감 있어
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:54	"And above all,
		I promise to aspire,
		그 무엇보다도
		열망하고
00:24:56	 
		 
00:24:56	inspire, and perspire."
		영감을 주고 땀을 흘린다고
		약속하겠습니다
00:24:58	 
		영감을 주고 땀을 흘린다고
		약속하겠습니다
00:24:58	Obviously, we found a shortage
		of words ending in "spire."
		영감을 주고 땀을 흘린다고
		약속하겠습니다
00:24:58	Obviously, we found a shortage
		of words ending in "spire."
		 
00:24:58	Obviously, we found a shortage
		of words ending in "spire."
		분명히 "spire"로
		끝나게 깔맞춤 했네
00:25:01	 
		분명히 "spire"로
		끝나게 깔맞춤 했네
00:25:01	Yeah. It's very funny.
		It's hilarious. Just...
		분명히 "spire"로
		끝나게 깔맞춤 했네
00:25:01	Yeah. It's very funny.
		It's hilarious. Just...
		 
00:25:01	Yeah. It's very funny.
		It's hilarious. Just...
		아주 재밌지
		웃긴거 알아
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:06	ha ha ha!
		 
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	Don't.
		 
00:25:09	Don't.
		그만해
00:25:11	Don't.
		 
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	Ha ha ha!
		 
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:26	 
		야
00:25:26	Oh, hey.
		야
00:25:28	 
		야
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:30	How do those two
		know each other?
		저 둘은 어떻게
		아는거야?
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	They don't.
		모를걸요
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	Paranoid much?
		피해망상인거
		아니에요?
00:25:36	 
		 
00:25:36	The council just got
		burned to a crisp.
		의회가 바삭하게
		구어지고
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:38	Some mysterious hunters
		just blew through town,
		미스테리 헌터가
		갑자기 나타나고
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	and this guy
		just happens to know
		이 놈은 뭐든지
		다 알고있지
00:25:41	 
		이 놈은 뭐든지
		다 알고있지
00:25:41	everything
		about everything.
		이 놈은 뭐든지
		다 알고있지
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:43	Yes, paranoid.
		그래, 피해망상이다
00:25:46	 
		 
00:26:08	Hey,
		where have you been?
		어디있었어?
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	Hey, sorry.
		I got stuck at work.
		미안해
		일때문에
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	Jeremy, if you were too
		chicken to do the dance thingy,
		춤추는게 그렇게
		무서웠으면
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	then you should've
		just told me.
		그냥 나한테
		말하지 그랬어
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	No, no.
		I knew the dance.
		아냐
		나도 출줄 알아
00:26:19	 
		아냐
		나도 출줄 알아
00:26:19	I watched
		some lesson online,
		아냐
		나도 출줄 알아
00:26:20	I watched
		some lesson online,
		 
00:26:20	I watched
		some lesson online,
		인터넷으로 한
		100번은 봤을걸
00:26:20	 
		인터넷으로 한
		100번은 봤을걸
00:26:20	like, 100 times.
		인터넷으로 한
		100번은 봤을걸
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	You did?
		그랬어?
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:26	Hey, what's that
		Shane guy doing here?
		쉐인은 여기
		왜 온거야?
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	He's a judge.
		심사위원이야
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:31	I talked to him
		about my dad.
		아빠에 대해
		얘기해봤어
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	I mean, he said that
		he never seemed depressed
		아빠가 우울하거나
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	or suicidal
		or anything, so...
		자살같은걸 하고
		싶어하진 않았데
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	your dad?
		Yeah.
		너희 아버지?
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:41	You know, I figured
		I'd explore every possibility,
		모든 가능성을
		조사해보려 해
00:26:43	 
		 
00:26:43	even the bleak ones.
		비관적인 것도
		말이야
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	What are you
		looking at?
		뭐 보는거야?
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	Your dad was doing
		the right thing for this town.
		너희 아버지는 마을을 위해
		옳은 일을 하신거야
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	The whole council was.
		They died heroes.
		의회 멤버도 마찬가지고
		영웅답게 돌아가신거야
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:58	Oh, you again.
		Ha ha!
		또 당신이야
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:01	I must be the least
		intimidating mass murderer ever.
		사람들이 무서워 하지 않는
		살인범이 아마 나일거야
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	Well, you still
		never gave me a name,
		아직 이름을
		말해주지 않았자나요
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	and it's
		kind of urgent.
		아주 급하다구요
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	Listen. There is
		no other name. Look.
		다른 사람은
		나도 몰라요
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	At any given moment, there are 5
		hunters in existence, all right?
		지금도 5명이나 되는
		헌터가 있다는거죠?
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:13	Most of them have
		no idea who they are
		대부분이 자기가 누군지
		생각도 못할거에요
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	or what
		their purpose is.
		자신들의 목적도
		모르겠죠
00:27:17	 
		 
00:27:17	Means finding more
		than one in a lifetime
		살면서 하나이상
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	is next to impossible.
		보기는 불가능해요
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:26	Heh. Subtle.
		미묘한데요
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	Like you didn't
		already know.
		네가 모르는 척
		하는 것처럼 말이지
00:27:30	 
		네가 모르는 척
		하는 것처럼 말이지
00:27:30	Oh...
		네가 모르는 척
		하는 것처럼 말이지
00:27:30	Oh...
		 
00:27:31	 
		 
00:27:31	You have 5 seconds
		to give me another name,
		5초 줄테니까
		빨리 말해
00:27:33	 
		 
00:27:33	or you die.
		아니면 죽어
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:34	You know, since it's
		generally unwise
		헌터를 쫓는 뱀파이어는
		현명하지 못하니까
00:27:36	 
		헌터를 쫓는 뱀파이어는
		현명하지 못하니까
00:27:36	for a vampire
		to seek out a hunter,
		헌터를 쫓는 뱀파이어는
		현명하지 못하니까
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:37	it means you're
		interested in the Mark.
		표식에 관심이
		있다는 거겠지
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	That's probably because
		of where it leads,
		표식이 가리키는것
		때문이겠지
00:27:40	 
		 
00:27:40	but here's the thing.
		당신이 모르는게 있는데
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	Even if you
		complete the Mark
		표식을 완성해서
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:43	and you get the map,
		지도를 얻는다해도
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	the thing that
		you're looking for
		당신이 찾는것은
00:27:46	 
		 
00:27:46	is sealed with a spell
		only a certain kind
		마법으로
		봉인되 있어요
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	of witch can perform.
		특정한 마녀들만이
		풀 수 있죠
00:27:49	 
		특정한 마녀들만이
		풀 수 있죠
00:27:49	What kind of witch?
		특정한 마녀들만이
		풀 수 있죠
00:27:49	What kind of witch?
		 
00:27:49	What kind of witch?
		어떤 마녀인데?
00:27:50	 
		어떤 마녀인데?
00:27:50	Come on, Damon. Uh!
		어떤 마녀인데?
00:27:51	Come on, Damon. Uh!
		 
00:27:51	Come on, Damon. Uh!
		그만좀해, 데이먼
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	I love pressure points.
		What kind of witch?
		압박할때가 좋더라
		어떤 마녀야?
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:58	Come on.
		You're a big boy.
		이봐, 너도
		어른이자나
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	You can figure
		this one out.
		너도 알수 있어
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	A Bennett witch.
		배넷가 마녀구나
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	Aren't too many of
		those lying around,
		너도 알겠지만
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:05	as I'm sure you know.
		해야될게 산더미
		같지 않아?
00:28:07	 
		 
00:28:07	So none of this matters
		until Bonnie
		그니까 보니가 마법을
		되찾지 못한다면
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	is back in touch
		with her magic.
		이런것들은
		걱정거리도 아니지
00:28:10	 
		 
00:28:10	Between the two of us,
		who do you think
		보니가 거기까지
		가는데
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	she trusts to help
		her get there?
		우리 둘중에 누가
		도와줄 수 있다고 생각해?
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:18	5 seconds are up
		5초 지났어
00:28:21	5 seconds are up
		 
00:28:21	 
		 
00:28:21	unless you just realized
		you need me alive.
		 
00:28:21	unless you just realized
		you need me alive.
		내가 산채로 필요하단걸
		깨달았나 보네
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:25	Now, if you'll
		excuse me,
		이제, 좀 비켜줄래
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	I have a scholarship
		to award.
		장학금 수여를
		해야 하거든
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:30	And now the
		moment you've been waiting for.
		여러분이 기다리던
		순간입니다
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	Caroline, would you
		do the honors?
		캐롤라인,
		발표해줄래요?
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	This year's
		miss Mystic Falls is...
		올해의 미스
		미스틱폴즈는
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:43	April young.
		에이프릴 영입니다
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:56	Jeremy.
		제레미
00:28:57	 
		 
00:29:15	Hey, where
		have you been?
		어딨었어?
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:19	What are you doing
		with that?
		그거로 뭐해?
00:29:21	 
		 
00:29:25	Put it down.
		내려놔
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:27	Connor was right.
		코너가 맞았어
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	All I can think about
		is killing vampires.
		뱀파이어 죽이는것만
		생각나
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:34	You're nothing
		like Connor.
		넌 코너랑 달라
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	I want
		to believe that,
		나도 그렇게
		믿고 싶어
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	and I know I don't
		want to hurt you,
		날 다치게 하지
		않을거란거 알지만
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:41	but everything
		inside of me is telling me
		이 말뚝을 누나 심장에
		꼽으라고
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:43	to drive this stake
		through your heart.
		내 몸 안에서
		외치고 있어
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:46	Why would you
		say that?
		왜 그런말을 해?
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:50	It's me, Jeremy.
		나야 제레미
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:53	And you're a vampire.
		넌 뱀파이어야
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	Yeah, but I'm also
		your sister.
		그치만 난
		네 누나이기도 해
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:58	Jer...
		제레미
00:29:59	 
		 
00:30:02	I would never do
		anything to hurt you.
		절대로 널 다치게
		하지 않을거야
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:14	No.
		아니자나
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:19	Get it away from me.
		나한테서 떨어져
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:24	Jere...
		Jeremy.
		제레미
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	Jer, wake up.
		Please wake up.
		일어나봐
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:32	Nngh...
		 
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:40	Jeremy! Get out of here, Matt.
		-제레미
		-여기서 나가
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	Jeremy, you don't
		want to do this, ok?
		이러고 싶지
		않자나 그치?
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:44	That's your sister.
		네 누나야
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	It's that stupid Mark
		on your arm.
		바보같은 그
		표식때문이야
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	Shut up, Matt!
		Jeremy, look at me.
		-닥쳐
		-제레미 나좀봐
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	I'm human,
		and I'm telling you
		난 사람이야
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	not to hurt her.
		누나를 해치지 마
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:54	Get out of here, Matt!
		얘 데리고 나가
00:30:57	 
		 
00:31:00	Let me do it.
		Let me do it. Let me do it.
		내가 할게
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:05	Oh!
		 
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:08	Oh...
		 
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:26	Your mom parties harder
		than you do.
		엄마가 너보다 더
		빡시게 노시던데
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	Does she have the gene?
		엄마한테
		물려받은거야?
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:30	Dad.
		Ah.
		아빠한테
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	What about
		your parents?
		너희 부모님은?
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:34	Never met them.
		얼굴도 몰라
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	My adoptive parents
		found out
		양부모님이
		발견했어
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	about my wolf gene
		when I did,
		내가 한밤중에
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:40	the night that I turned
		변했을때
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	and tore apart
		their living room.
		거실을 죄다
		물어 뜯어놨어
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:45	Promptly
		kicked me out.
		곧바로
		날 내쫓았어
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	You never told me
		how it triggered.
		어떻게 시작됬는지
		말 안했지
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	You mean,
		who I killed?
		누굴 죽였냐고?
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	Boating accident.
		보트타다가
		사고로
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	We were drunk.
		I thought I wasn't.
		난 아니라고 생각했지만
		우린 취해있었어
00:31:59	 
		 
00:32:02	So what's with you
		근데 어르신들이랑
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	chatting up all these
		old-timers, huh...
		얘기한건 뭐야
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	my mom,
		that Professor guy.
		우리 엄마나
		교수님이나
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:09	That Professor guy
		is, like, 30,
		그 교수 한 30살은
		되보이더라
00:32:12	 
		 
00:32:12	and he's hot
		and smart.
		멋지고 똑똑하자나
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:16	You know him
		or something?
		아는 사람이야?
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	No. I just met him.
		Why?
		여기서 만났는데
		왜?
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	No reason.
		그냥
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:26	I never
		answered your question,
		네 질문에
		대답하지 않았지
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	if I'd ever thought
		about being human.
		사람이 되고 싶은적이
		있냐고
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	Once.
		한번
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:33	I was on a trek
		in the andes,
		안데스산맥을
		오르고 있을때
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	and a hummingbird
		flew up to me
		벌새가 날아왔어
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	and just hovered there
		staring at me.
		내 주위를 맴돌며
		날 쳐다봤지
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:43	Its tiny heart was pattering
		like a machine gun...
		그 작은 심장이
		어찌나 빨리 뛰던지
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:48	And I thought,
		"what a thing, you know,
		죽음의 길목에서
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	"to have to work
		that hard every day
		살기 위해서
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	"just to stay alive,
		쉬지 않고 열심히
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	to be constantly
		on the verge of death,"
		움직이는게
		얼마나 대단하던지
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:01	and how satisfying
		every day must be
		그렇게 살아남으면
00:33:03	 
		 
00:33:03	that it survived...
		얼마나 만족스럽겠어
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:07	And that
		was the only time
		사람이 되길
		생각해본건
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:09	I thought
		about being human.
		그때가 처음이야
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:17	What's he saying?
		뭐라는거야?
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:19	A bunch of bs
		about being human.
		사람이 되고 싶어했던
		순간에 대한 헛소리
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	The sooner we get rid
		of this guy, the better.
		빨리 저놈을
		없애는게 좋겠어
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:27	Elena, wait.
		엘레나 기다려
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:28	I have to find Jeremy.
		제레미
		찾아봐야되
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	This shouldn't be
		happening to him.
		이런일이 생겨선
		안되는데
00:33:31	 
		 
00:33:31	Elena, wait.
		It's my fault.
		엘레나 잠깐만
		내 잘못이야
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:32	What are you
		talking about?
		무슨 소리야?
00:33:34	 
		 
00:33:34	I'm starting to think
		that when a hunter
		헌터가 뱀파이어를
		죽이면
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:35	kills a vampire,
		their urge
		죽이고 싶어하는
		충동도
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	to keep killing
		grows stronger.
		더 강해지는것 같아
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:40	Tell me that Jeremy
		hasn't been with you
		제레미가 여지껏
		너랑 있었던게
00:33:42	 
		제레미가 여지껏
		너랑 있었던게
00:33:42	this entire time.
		제레미가 여지껏
		너랑 있었던게
00:33:42	this entire time.
		 
00:33:42	this entire time.
		아니라고 말해줘
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	Tell me that you haven't
		been making him
		네가 뱀파이어를
		죽이라고
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	kill vampires, Stefan.
		시킨게 아니라고
		말해줘
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:48	We need the map
		to get the cure.
		치료제를 얻으려면
		지도가 필요해
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:50	If getting my humanity back
		means stripping Jeremy of his,
		제레미를 미치게 해야
		내 인간성을 되찾는다면
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	then I don't
		want the cure.
		치료제 따위는
		필요없어
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	He's the only way
		to fix all of this.
		제레미만이
		바로 잡을 수 있어
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:57	You mean me,
		나겠지
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:00	the only way
		to fix me.
		날 바로
		잡는거겠지
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:05	You don't have
		to love me like this.
		이렇게까지
		사랑하지 않아도 되
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:11	This is who I am now.
		지금은
		이게 나야
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:14	The old Elena died when
		she went off that bridge.
		예전 엘레나는 다리에서
		떨어졌을때 죽었어
00:34:18	 
		 
00:34:18	Let her go.
		그만 잊어
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:57	What are you doing?
		뭐해?
00:34:59	 
		 
00:34:59	I can't keep
		living here
		여기서 계속
		살 수는 없어
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:01	if I want
		to kill my sister.
		누나를 죽이고
		싶으면 어떡해
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	Elena knows that.
		엘레나도 알아
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:07	That's why she moved out
		and asked me to move in.
		그래서 집을 나가고
		나보고 들어와 달라더라
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	What?
		Look.
		뭐?
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	I'm not one
		of them, jer.
		난 뱀파이어가 아냐
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	I'll keep an eye on you,
		내가 계속
		감시할게
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	and we can keep this
		hunter business in check.
		이렇게 헌터 일은
		억누를수 있어
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	Where's Elena
		gonna go?
		누나는
		어디로 갔어?
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:36	I can't stay at home
		anymore.
		더이상 집에
		있을 수가 없어
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:44	Pick a room.
		방 잡아
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:48	I'll crash
		somewhere else.
		난 딴데서
		잘게
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:59	Tell me it's over, Ty.
		다 끝났다고
		말해줘
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:02	I really don't think
		I can do this anymore.
		더 이상은
		못 할것 같아
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:09	It's over.
		Nice work.
		끝났어
		잘했어
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	We are one step closer
		to ending this.
		막바지에
		다다른거야
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:28	 
		김씨가 주종관계를 끊었어
		넌 어디야?
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:33	We got another one.
		한명 더
		생겼어요
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	Good.
		좋아
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:39	We're almost ready.
		이제 다
		되가는군
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	I want to leave Tyler out of
		this when it all goes down.
		이 일이 시작되면
		타일러는 빼주세요
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	We'll talk when you've
		broken theast le.
		마지막 놈이 주종관계를
		끊으면 그때 얘기하자
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:54	Ah, thanks.
		고마워요
00:36:57	 
		 
00:37:00	Just being polite.
		그냥 공손하게
		대한거야
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	Thought you
		hated whiskey.
		위스키 싫어하는줄
		알았는데
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	My brother
		wants to kill me.
		내 동생이 날
		죽이고 싶어해요
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	Welcome to the club.
		동지가 된걸
		환영해
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:12	Jeremy can't
		live with me,
		제레미는 나와
		살 수 없어요
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:15	Stefan wants
		to fix me,
		스테판은 날
		치료하고 싶어하고
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:17	and Caroline
		flat out admitted
		캐롤라인인은
		딱 부러지게
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	that she doesn't
		like me this way.
		이런 나는
		싫다고 말하더군요
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	Think it's safe to say that I'm not
		so great at this vampire thing.
		뱀파이어로서 내가
		잘하지 못하나봐요
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	You want to know
		what I think?
		내 생각이
		알고 싶어?
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:30	I don't think I've ever
		seen you more alive.
		지금보다 더 활기찬걸
		본적이 없는것 같아
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:41	That dance that
		they did today
		오늘 춤추는
		사람을 보면서
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:45	kind of reminded me
		of when...
		그때가
		떠올랐어요
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	when we
		danced together?
		우리가 춤췄을때?
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:54	I wanted to dance
		with you today.
		오늘 당신과
		춤추고 싶었어요
00:37:59	 
		 
00:38:51	Elena is right.
		I just need to let go.
		엘레나가 맞아
		난 그만 잊어야 해
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:54	No. You're right,
		Stefan.
		아니, 네가 맞아
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	It's not pretty,
		and it's not easy,
		깔끔하지도 않고
		쉽지도 않겠지만
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	but you can't
		give up on her.
		엘레나를
		포기해선 안되
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	Caroline, she looked
		me in the eye,
		내 눈을 보고
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	and she told me
		to move on.
		정리하라고
		말했어
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:05	She's lost, ok?
		정신이 나간거야
		알았어?
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	You and her... epic.
		너랑 엘레나는
		대단해
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	Her and Damon...
		ugh, God.
		엘레나랑 데이먼은
		윽
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:14	There's something
		wrong with her.
		뭔가 잘못됐어
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:21	Just promise me you won't
		stop looking for the cure.
		치료제 찾는걸
		멈추지 않겠다고 약속해줘
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	Klaus won't let me,
		even if I wanted to.
		그러고 싶어도
		클라우스가 냅두지 않을걸
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:25	What does he care?
		He doesn't even want it.
		클라우스가 왜?
		걔는 원하지도 않는데
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	He wants to keep
		Elena human
		엘레나를 계속
		사람으로 두려고 하지
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:29	so that he can make
		more hybrids.
		그래야 하이브리드를
		계속 만들수 있으니
00:39:31	 
		 
00:39:31	He's gonna need them.
		하이브리드가
		필요하겠지
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:33	Tyler has almost got
		all of them unsired.
		타일러가 그들을
		다 풀어주고 있거든
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:39	Oh, my God.
		맙소사
00:39:41	 
		 
00:39:46	Oh...
		맙
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	My...
		소
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:49	God.
		사
00:39:50	 
		 
00:40:00	Uh...
		 
00:40:01	 
		 
00:40:01	I was trying to understand
		why Klaus was so intrigued
		데이먼이랑 엘레나에 대해
		클라우스가 왜 그렇게
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:04	by Damon and Elena.
		흥미로워 하는지
		이해하려고 했는데
00:40:06	 
		 
00:40:06	He said I would
		figure it out.
		내가 알아낼거라고
		말하더라구
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:07	This is what he
		was talking about.
		그 때 했던 말이
		이거야
00:40:09	 
		 
00:40:09	What are you
		talking about?
		무슨말이야?
00:40:10	 
		 
00:40:10	Think about it.
		생각해봐
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	Every time Elena
		has had a problem,
		엘레나한테
		문제가 생기면
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	Damon has been
		the magic solution.
		데이먼이
		해결책이었어
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:22	Today Elena
		was worried about Jeremy.
		오늘은 엘레나가
		제레미를 걱정하자
00:40:26	 
		 
00:40:26	Who swoops in
		and tells her to relax?
		누가 진정하라고
		말했을까?
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:28	Damon, and she listens.
		데이먼이야
		엘레나는 들어주었지
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:30	When Elena started feeding,
		who said that she could only
		엘레나가 피를
		마셨을때
00:40:32	 
		 
00:40:32	drink blood
		straight from the vein?
		누가 혈관에서
		직접 마셔야 한다고 했을까?
00:40:35	 
		 
00:40:35	Damon.
		데이먼
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:39	And when she tried
		to drink from animals?
		동물 피를 마시려고
		했을때는?
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:41	Couldn't
		keep it down.
		넘기질 못했지
00:40:42	 
		 
00:40:42	And blood bags?
		Same thing.
		-블러드백은?
		-똑같았지
00:40:44	 
		 
00:40:48	Name one vampire
		in the history of vampires
		뱀파이어 역사상
		블러드백에서
00:40:51	 
		 
00:40:51	who couldn't drink
		blood from a blood bag.
		피를 못먹는 뱀파이어있으면
		이름 좀 대봐
00:40:53	 
		 
00:40:53	Damon said she couldn't,
		so she couldn't.
		데이먼이 안된다니까
		못마신거야
00:40:56	 
		 
00:41:03	Damon likes the red dress,
		Elena likes the red dress.
		데이먼이 빨간 드레스가 좋다니까
		엘레나도 그랬지
00:41:05	 
		 
00:41:05	Damon says kill Connor,
		she kills Connor.
		데이먼이 코너를 죽이라고하자
		엘레나가 죽였지
00:41:08	 
		 
00:41:08	What if
		it's possible?
		이게 가능하다면?
00:41:10	 
		 
00:41:10	Damon's blood made her
		a vampire, right?
		데이먼의 피로
		엘레나가 뱀파이어가 된거자나?
00:41:14	 
		 
00:41:14	It's rare,
		but it happens.
		드물긴 하지만
		그렇게 되나바
00:41:16	 
		 
00:41:16	What if this
		is one of those times?
		만약 이번이
		그런 드문 경우라면?
00:41:18	 
		 
00:41:18	What if this
		is really happening?
		이게 실제로
		가능한거라면?
00:41:22	 
		 
00:41:33	Elena is sired
		to Damon.
		엘레나는 데이먼의
		종이 된거야
00:41:36
