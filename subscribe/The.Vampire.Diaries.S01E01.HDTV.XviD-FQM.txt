		여름방학은 그냥 넘겨줬어
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	But i am done

00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	So don't be

00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:15	Thank you.
		고마워

00:09:22	Once our home state
		of virginia
		joined confederacy
		1861년 버지니아가
		남부 연방에 가입하자
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	In 1861, it created
		a tremendous
		amount of tension
		미국 전국에
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	Within the state.
		큰 긴장상태를 촉발했지
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:31	People in virginia's
		northwest region
		버지니아의 북서지방 사람들은
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	Had different ideals
		than those from
		the traditional deep south.
		남부의 전통적인 사상과
		다른 관념을 가지고 있었어
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	Then virginia
		divided in 1863
		그러다 버지니아가 1863년
		분할되고
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	With the northwest region
		joining the union.

00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	I must have said,

		난 '괜찮아. 고마워'란 말을
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	At least 37 times.
		37번 이상 얘기한 것 같다
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	And i didn't mean it once.
		하지만 한번도 진심이 아녔다
00:10:48

		넌 그럼 정말 우연히도
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	Hanging out
		in a cemetery.
		묘지에서 시간을 떼우고 있던거야?
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	I'm visiting.
		i have family here.
		잠시 들렀어
		가족이 여기 묻혔거든
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	Oh.
		아
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:28	Wow. tactless.

00:12:29	I'm sorry.
		it's the fog,
		미안. 안개 때문에
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	It's making me
		foggy.
		당황을 했어
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	And then back there,
		there was this bird,
		그런데 갑자기 뒤에서
		새가 날아와서
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	And it was all
		very hitchcock
		for a second.
		잠깐 동안은
		히치콕 영화 같더라고

00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:20	I like it.
		맘에 들어
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	It's been
		15 years, damon.
		15년이 지났어, 데이먼
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	Thank god.
		다행이지
00:32:26	 
		 
00:32:26	I couldn't take
		another day of the nineties.
		90년대는 정말
		참고 보기 힘들었거든
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:28	That horrible grunge look?
		그 끔찍한 그런지 록 스타일 말야?
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	[chuckles]
		did not suit you.
		정말 너한테 안 어울리더라
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:33	Remember, stefan,
		it's important
		to stay away from fads.
		기억해, 스테판
		유행은 멀리하는게 좋아
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	Why are you here?
		여긴 왜 온거야?
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	I miss
		my little brother.
		우리 동생이 그리웠거든
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	You hate small towns.
		시골은 싫어하잖아
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	It's boring.
		there's nothing
		for you to do.
		지루하다고. 할일이 없다고
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:44	I've managed to keep
		myself busy.
		이번엔 바쁘게 약속을 잡아놨어
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	You know, you left
		that girl alive tonight.
		그 여자애 결국 살려줬더군
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	That's very clumsy of you.
		정말 서투른 짓을 했어
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	Ah. that can be
		a problem...for you.
		아. 그게 문제가 되는구나
		..너한테만 말이지
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:55	Why are you here now?
		여긴 왜 온거야?
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	I could ask you
		the same question.
		나도 같은 질문을 하고 싶어
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	However,
		i'm fairly certain
		근데 난 확실히 믿어
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	Your answer can be
		summed up all into
		네 질문의 대답이
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	One little word...
		한 단어로 응축된단 사실을
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	Elena.
		'엘레나' 말이지
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:09	[sighs]
		 
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:11	[indistinct chatter]
		 
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:30	[siren]
		 
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:32	Hey.
		보니
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:33	We're gonna go
		mainline coffee,
		wait for news.
		우린 카페에 가서
		소식을 기다릴거야
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:37	I gotta take
		jeremy home.
		동생 좀 집에 데려다 줘야겠어
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:38	Elena, there's no way
		i'm psychic.
		엘레나, 내가 영매일
		일은 절대 없어
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	I know that.
		알아
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	But whatever i saw,
		하지만 내가 뭘 봤든
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	Or i think i saw,
		뭘 봤다고 생각하든
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	I have this feeling...
		이런 예감이 들어..
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:53	Bonnie, what?
		보니, 뭔데?
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:57	That it's just
		the beginning.
		아직 시작에 불과하다고
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:02	She took
		my breath away.
		내 숨을 멎게 하더군
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:05	Elena.
		엘레나 말야
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	She's a dead ringer
		for katherine.
		정말 캐더린하고 똑닮았으니까
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:12	Is it working, stefan?
		효과가 있어?
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:14	Being around her,
		being in her world?
		그녀 곁을 맴돌며
		그녀를 만나면
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	Does it make you
		feel alive?
		캐더린이 살아난 것 같디?
00:34:17	 
		 
00:34:17	She's not katherine.
		엘레나는 캐더린이 아냐
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	Well, let's hope not.
		아니길 빌어야지
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	We both know
		how that ended.
		어떻게 끝났는진 둘다 아니까
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	Tell me something,
		when's the last time
		얘기 좀 해줘라. 다람쥐 보다
		강한 건 언제 먹어봤지?
00:34:25	 
		얘기 좀 해줘라. 다람쥐 보다
		강한 건 언제 먹어봤지?
00:34:25	You had something
		stronger than
		a squirrel?
		얘기 좀 해줘라. 다람쥐 보다
		강한 건 언제 먹어봤지?
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:27	I know what you're doing,
		damon. it's not gonna work.
		형이 무슨 짓 하려는지 알아
		나한텐 안 먹혀
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	Yeah? come on.
		don't you crave
		a little?
		왜 이래? 너도
		먹고 싶어 죽겠지 않니?
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	Stop it.
		let's do it.
		together.
		멈춰 / 어서 하자고. 둘이서
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	I saw a couple girls
		out there.
		거기 여자 애들 몇명을 봤어
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:36	Or just, let's just
		cut to the chase,
		아님 그냥 딴건 집어 치우고
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	Let's just go
		straight for elena!
		곧장 엘레나한테 가는거야!
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	Stop it!
		그만해!
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:42	Imagine what her
		blood tastes like!
		그녀 피 맛이 어떨지
		상상을 해봐
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:44	I can.
		난 상상이 되거든
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:46	I said stop!
		그만 두랬지!
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:48	[growling]
		 
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:50	[grunts]
		 
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:53	[groaning]
		 
00:34:56	 
		 
00:35:01	I was impressed.
		인상적인데
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:05	I give it a six.
		10점 만점에 6점 줄게
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:07	Missing style, but i was
		pleasantly surprised.
		스타일이 어긋났지만
		꽤 놀라웠어
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:11	Very good
		with the whole face--
		표정 연기도...
		압권이었고
00:35:14	 
		표정 연기도...
		압권이었고
00:35:14	[imitating stefan] thing.
		it was good.
		표정 연기도...
		압권이었고
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	You know, it's all
		fun and games,
		damon, huh?
		형한텐 이게 다
		재미있는 게임이지?
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	But wherever you go,
		people die.
		형이 어딜 가든 사람이 죽어
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	That's a given.
		not here.
		- 어쩔 수 없는걸
		- 여기선 아냐
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	I won't allow it.
		내가 말릴거야
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:26	I take that
		as an invitation.
		나한텐 허락으로 들리는데
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	Damon, please.
		데이먼, 제발
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:29	After all these
		years, can't we just
		give it a rest?
		여태껏 그랬으면
		이제 잠시 그만두지 그래?
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	I promised you
		an eternity of misery,
		너에게 영원한 불행을 약속했지
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:35	So i'm just keeping my word.
		그래서 내 약속을 지키는것 뿐야
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	Just stay away
		from elena.
		제발 엘레나 근처엔 얼씬 하지마
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:41	Where's your ring?
		반지는 어디갔어?
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:44	[inhales sharply]
		 
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	Oh, yeah, sun's coming up
		in a couple of hours,
		이런, 몇시간 후면
		해가 뜰텐데
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	And, poof,
		ashes to ashes.
		곧 재로 변하겠군
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:54	[chuckles]
		 
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:56	Relax.
		진정해
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:59	It's right here.
		바로 여기 있어
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:09	[groans]
		 
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:15	You should know better
		than to think you're
		stronger than me.
		나보다 강할거라 생각하면 착각이야
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	You lost that fight
		when you stopped
		사람들 피 먹는걸
		그만 둔 뒤로
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	Feeding on people.
		넌 이미 싸움에서 졌어
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:21	I wouldn't try it again.
		난 그러지 않을거야
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:26	[rustling]
		 
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	I think we woke
		zach up. hmm.
		잭을 깨웠나 본데
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	Sorry, zach.
		미안해, 잭
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	[whistling]
		 
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:35	[breathing heavily]
		 
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:45	You ok?
		괜찮니?
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:50	I called jenna,
		she's on her way.
		이모 불렀어. 오고 있대
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:57	Those people
		in uniforms,
		제복 입은 사람들
00:36:59	 
		 
00:36:59	Last time i checked,
		they're the police.
		내가 마지막으로 확인했을땐
		경찰이었거든
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:08	People are going
		to stop giving you
		breaks, jer.
		이제 사람들은 널 봐주지 않을거야
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:13	They just don't care
		anymore.
		이젠 더이상 신경을 안쓴다고
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	They don't remember
		that our parents
		are dead,
		우리 부모님이 돌아가신건
		이제 다들 기억 못해
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:19	Because they've got
		their own lives
		to deal with.
		왜냐면 다들 상대해야 할
		인생이란 게 있으니까
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:23	The rest of the world
		has moved on.
		다른 사람들은 다
		마음을 옮겼어
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	You should try, too.
		너도 좀 그래봐
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:29	I've seen you in the cemetery
		writing in your diary.
		난 누나가 묘지에서
		일기 쓰는 거 봤어
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	Is that--is that
		supposed to be you
		moving on?
		그게.. 극복한 사람이
		하는 짓이야?
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:38	Mom and dad wouldn't
		have wanted this.
		엄마랑 아빠는
		이런걸 원치 않았을거야
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:48	Are you sober yet?
		아직 술 안 깼니?
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	[inhales]
		 
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	No. [exhales]
		아직
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	Keep drinking.
		i gotta get you home.
		계속 마셔
		널 집에 데려다 줘야 해
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	I gotta get me home.
		나도 가야 하고
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:57	Why didn't he
		go for me?
		왜 나랑 같이 안갔을까?
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:01	You know, how come
		있지, 어째서
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	The guys that i want
		never want me?
		내가 원하는 남자들은
		날 원하지 않는거야?
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	I'm not touching that.
		그 얘긴 안할래
00:38:06	 
		 
00:38:06	I'm inappropriate.
		난 참 눈치없어
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	I always say
		the wrong thing.
		늘 틀린 말만 하지
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	And...
		그리고..
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:13	Elena always says
		the right thing.
		엘레나는 항상 옳은 말만 해
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:16	She doesn't even try!
		노력도 안하는데!
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:19	And he just picks her.
		그리고 그는 그녀를 선택했지
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:20	And she's always the one
		that everyone picks,
		늘 모두들 그녀를 선택해
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	For everything.
		모든 걸 말야
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:25	And i try so hard,
		난 정말 열심히 노력하는데
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	And...
		그래도..
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	I'm never the one.
		난 그렇게 안돼
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	It's not a competition,
		caroline.
		경쟁시합이 아냐, 캐롤라인
00:38:37	 
		 
00:38:39	Yeah, it is.
