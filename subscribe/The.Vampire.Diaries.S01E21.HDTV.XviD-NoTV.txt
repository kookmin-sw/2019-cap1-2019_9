00:09:02	Can you hear me?
		내 말 들려?
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:06	Thanks for coming.
		와줘서 고마워
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	I'm nervous.
		긴장된다
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:13	But i'm happy that you're here.
		여기 와줘서 기뻐
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:17	- Love you.
		- (I Love You.)
		사랑해
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:37	Hello,elena.
		안녕, 엘레나
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:40	You look just like her.
		정말 그녀와 닮았구나
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	It's eerie.
		섬뜩할 정도야
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	- You've met katherine?
		- She found me after i turned.
		- 캐더린을 만나보셨나요?
		- 내가 변한뒤 날 찾았었지
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	Genetic curiosity, i suppose.
		유전적인 호기심 때문이었겠지
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	She would be fascinated by you.
		널 보면 깜짝 놀랄거야
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	Is that how you can walk in the day?
		그것 때문에
		낮에 다니실 수 있나요?
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	Katherine helped me obtain it.
		캐더린이 구해줬어
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	- Who's my father?
		- Not important.
		- 내 아버지는 누구죠?
		- 중요치 않아
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	- He was a teenage waste of space.
		- A name would be nice.
		- 10대 인간 쓰레기였지
		- 이름만 알려줘도 고맙겠어요
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	It would,wouldn't it?
		You ask a lot of questions.
		그러니? 너 참
		질문을 많이하는구나
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	Why did you compel that man to kill himself
		당신을 찾아다니지
		말라고 경고한 후
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	Right after he told me to stop looking for you?
		그 남자한테 자살하라고
		주문을 걸었던 이유가 뭐죠?
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	Traumatic impact.
		충격적인 임팩트를 주려고
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	Wish it would have been more effective.
		효과가 덜했던것 같지
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	Human life means that little to you?
		인간의 목숨은
		당신에게 중요치 않나요?
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	Means nothing to me.
		아무 의미 없지
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	It's just part of being what i am.
		나란 존재는 그러니까
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	No.
		It's not.
		아뇨. 그렇지 않아요
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	I know other vampires.
		That's not true.
		다른 뱀파이어들 아는데
		그건 사실이 아녜요
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	Your boyfriend over there by the pool table?
		Stefan salvatore.
		당구대 옆에 있는 남자친구
		스테판 말이니?
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	Why stefan?
		Why didn't you go for damon?
		왜 스테판이야?
		데이먼이 아니라?
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	Or do enjoy them both?
		아님 두명 다
		즐기고 있는거니?
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	Like katherine did?
		캐더린처럼?
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:49	- we should be in there.
		- No.
		- 들어가야 해
		- 아니
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	Isobel made it clear We're not to step foot inside.
		이자벨은 한발짝도
		들이지 말라고 분명히 말했어
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	I'm not gonna kill her in a crowded restaurant.
		난 붐비는 레스토랑에서
		이자벨을 죽이진 않을거라고
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	You're not gonna kill her,period.
		절대 죽여선 안 돼
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	She ruined your life, and you still want to protect her?
		당신 인생을 망쳤는데
		아직도 지켜주고 싶어?
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:00	She's my wife.
		내 아내야
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Was--Was my wife.
		내 아내..였지
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	I looked for the woman i married, but she wasn't there.
		내가 결혼했던 여자를
		찾았지만, 그녀는 없었어
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	Whoever that is is...
		저 여자가 누구건..
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	- Cold and detached.
		- yeah.
		- 차갑고 초연했지
		- 그래
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	- She's given up her humanity.
		- Yeah,see, i don't get that.
		- 인간성을 포기했어
		- 이해가 안 가
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	Stefan has his humanity.
		He's a good guy.
		스테판은 인간성이 있지
		착한 남자야
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	Oh,you're a dick and you kill people, but i still see Something human in you.
		넌 왕재수에다가 사람을 죽이지만
		아직도 뭔가 인간적인 모습이 보여
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	But with her, there was...
		하지만 그녀한테는..
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	There was nothing.
		아무것도 안 느껴져
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	You can turn it off...
		끄는거야
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:27	Like a button you can press.
		I mean,stefan's different.
		누를 수 있는 버튼처럼
		그러니까 스테판은 다르다고
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	He--He wants the whole human experience.
		그는.. 인간적 경험을 원해
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:32	He wants to feel every episode of "how i met your mother,"
		'How I Met Your Mother' (연애시트콤)
		모든 에피소드를 공감하고 싶어하지
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	So he shuts his feelings out.
		그래서 본능을 억제하지
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	The problem is, As a vampire, your instinct is not to feel.
		문제는 뱀파이어의 본능은
		감정이 느끼지 않는거야
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:42	Isobel chose the easier road-- No guilt and shame...
		이자벨은 쉬운 길을 택했지
		죄책감과 수치심 없이
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	No regret.
		I mean,come on.
		후회도 없이 사는거
		그러니까
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	If you could turn it off, wouldn't you?
		끌 수만 있다면
		그러고 싶지?
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	- You haven't.
		- Of course i have,rick.
		- 당신은 아니군
		- 물론 아니지
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	That's why i'm so fun to be around.
		그래서 난 곁에 두기
		참 재미있는 거야
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:58	why did you want to meet me?
		왜 날 만나고 싶은거죠?
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:00	It can't be to just catch up.
		놓친 시절 얘기를
		쉽게 할것도 아니고
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	Because i'm curious about you.
		네가 궁금했거든
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	But the real reason is I want what your uncle wants--
		하지만 진짜 이유는
		네 삼촌이 원하는것 때문이야
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	Johnathan gilbert's invention.
		조나단 길버트의 발명품
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	How do you know my uncle?
		우리 삼촌을 어떻게 알죠?
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	I used to spend a lot of time here when i was younger.
		어렸을 적 이곳에서
		많은 시간을 보냈거든
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	John had a crush on me for years.
		존은 날 오랫동안 짝사랑했었지
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	He was the first one that told me about vampires.
		나한테 처음으로
		뱀파이어에 대해 말해줬지
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	So,what made you want to be one?
		그럼 왜 뱀파이어가 되고 싶었죠?
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	It's a very long list of reasons,elena,
		이유를 늘여놓자면 정말 길지
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	All of which i'm sure you've thought about.
		너도 다 생각해봤을거야
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	That was your first lie.
		처음으로 거짓말을 하는군
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	It's inevitable.
		You're gonna get old.
		피할 수 없을거야
		넌 늙어가고
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	Stefan won't.
		스테판은 늙지 않을테니
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	Forever doesn't last very long When you're human.
		인간일 때
		영원이란 참 덧없어
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	I'm sorry, But i don't have what you're looking for.
		미안하지만 그쪽이
		원하는건 저한테 없어요
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	Sit down.And tell your boyfriend to walk away.
		앉아. 남자친구한테
		나가있으라고 하고
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:56	- I want the invention.
		- I don't have it.
		- 발명품을 원해
		- 나한테 없어요
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	I know that.
		But damon does.
		알고 있어
		데이먼한테 있지
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:02	And you're gonna get it for me.
		네가 날 위해 가져와
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	He's not gonna give it to me.
		저한테 주지 않을거에요
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	Then the blood will be on your hands.
		그럼 피 묻는 건
		네 손이 될 줄 알거라
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:16	It was nice meeting you,elena.
		만나서 즐거웠다, 엘레나
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:52	Hey,anna.
		Uh,where are you?
		애나. 어디 있니?
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	What's up?

00:14:04	She has fire.
		열정이 있어보여
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	Uh,i--I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	She won't return my calls.
		내 전화를 안 받네
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:10	Girl trouble?
		여자 문제니?
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	No,no trouble. Anna just owes me a call.That's it.
		문제는 아녜요
		애나가 전화를 안해줘서요
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	Is it the girl that i saw you with at the founder's pageant?
		설립자 파티 때
		같이 있던 여자애니?
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:18	You two are gettin' pretty hot and heavy,huh?
		둘 사이가 꽤 심각해졌나보군?
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	When was the last time you saw her?
		마지막으로 본지
		얼마나 됐어?
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:24	- Why?
		- I'm just making conversation.
		왜요? / 그냥 대화 좀 하려고
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	No one else in this house likes me.
		이 집에선 너만 날 좋아하지
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	At least i can talk to you, especially if you need someone to talk to about girls.
		적어도 너랑은 얘기 좀 하자
		특별히 여자 얘기하고 싶다면
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	Please.
		제발 좀
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:39	So,seriously, how well do you know anna?
		진짜, 애나를 얼마나 잘 아니?
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	I know anna extremely well.
		정말 잘 알아요
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:46	Well,know that you can talko me about anything.

		어떤 방법으로든
		널 도와줄거다
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	Why?
		왜요?
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	'Cause your dad would want me to.
		네 아버지가 그러길 원했으니까
00:14:58	 
		 
00:15:01	I'm,uh,i'm good.

00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:35	How'd you find me?
		날 어떻게 찾은거야?
00:15:37

00:15:39	And found the most expensive one.

00:15:41	Oh,i should have known.
		그럴줄 몰랐네
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	You were the one who taught me that.
		바로 당신이
		나한테 가르쳐줬잖아
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	What are you really doing here?
		정말 여긴 왜 온거야?
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	Well,you caused quite a stir when you blew into town.
		마을에 불쑥 나타났을때
		꽤 큰 소란을 일으켰잖아
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	So,everyone except for me you would have hurt.
		나 빼고 다들 다쳤지
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	I'm so sorry.
		정말 미안해
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	Did you bring the device?

00:15:58	 
		 
00:16:05	What are you doing with john gilbert?
		존 길버트랑 뭐 하는거야?
00:16:06

		어릴 때 몇번 데이트를 했지
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	He was a little bit in love with me.
		존이 날 좀 좋아했었거든
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	I'm sure one of the many.
		많은 남자 중 한명이었지
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	You know, this little invention, what do you want with it?
		보잘 것 없는 발명품
		그걸로 뭘 하려고?
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	Oh,me personally?
		개인적으로 말야?
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	I don't want anything with it.
		난 전혀 원치 않아
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	I'm just doing what i'm told.
		내가 들은대로 하는 것 뿐이지
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	You know,damon, we're on the same si.
		데이먼, 우린 같은 편이야
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	oh,yeah?
		Which side is that?
		어떤 편인데?
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	Katherine's.
		캐더린 편
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	She wants john gilbert to have the device.
		존 길버트가
		발명품을 가지길 원해
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	And i think that you know
		너도 알거야
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	that she's not happy When she doesn't get what she wants.

		왜 궂은 일을
		대신 해주는 거야?
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	Don't kill the messenger.
		나한테 화내지 마
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	We both know that you can't control katherine.
		캐더린을 조종할 수 없는거
		우리 둘 다 아니까
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	She does what she wants.
		원하는 건 뭐든 손에 넣지
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	- so do i.
		- Oh,really,damon?
		- 나도 마찬가지야
		- 정말로?
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	You do?
		네가?
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:49	What should we do now?
		이제 뭘 할까?
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:56	Oh,yeah.
		Resurface.
		그래. 추억으로 돌아가자
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:11	Now that i have your attention,listen up.

		엘레나를 쫓는거
		잘못한 선택이었어

		엘레나는 내버려둬
		아니면 갈기갈기 찢을거야
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Because i do believe in killing the messenger.
		난 소식 전한 이를
		죽여야 한다고 믿거든
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	you know why?
		왜 그런 줄 알아?
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:26	Because it sends a message.
		그건 메세지를 전해주거든
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:30	Katherine wants something from me,
		캐더린이 나한테
		뭘 원한다면
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	You tell that little bitch to come get it herself.
		그 년한테 직접
		와서 가져가라고 해
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:54	Hi.

00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	Hey.

00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:59	I couldn't sleep last night.
		어젯밤 잠을 잘 못잤어
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	You were obviously upset about something, And i just walked away.
		넌 화가 난게 분명한데
		난 그냥 자리를 떠났지
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	That's not me.
		나답지 않아
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	That can't be us.
		우리답지 않고
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	You're my friend, elena.
		넌 내 친구야, 엘레나
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	If you need me, i'm here for you.
		날 필요로 하면
		난 네 곁에 있어줄게
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	And i'm sorry i couldn't show you that yesterday.
		어젯밤에 그런 걸
		보여주지 못해 미안해
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:24	I met my birth mother.
		생모를 만났어
00:18:26

		캐롤라인이 그러길
		혼자 지낸지 2주 됐다며
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	Is everything ok?
		무슨 일 있어?
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	You're asking me about my mom.
		Seriously?
		우리 엄마 안부
		물어보는 거지?
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	Look,man,why don't i just have her give you a call when she walks back through town?
		다시 돌아오시면
		전화주라고 말씀드릴까?
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Dude...
		야..
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	That's not what i meant.
		그 뜻이 아냐
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	Ok?
		I'm just trying to...
		난 그저..
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:11	- I don't know what to say.
		- Well,good,man.
		- 뭐라고 해야할지
		- 괜찮아
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	Don't say anything,
		아무 말 하지마
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	'Cause you're a dick.End of story.
		넌 나쁜놈이니까
		얘기 끝
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	I know...
		알아
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:19	Whatever.
		아무렴
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:27	thanks for meeting me.
		와줘서 고마워
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	I wanted you to see this.
		이걸 봤으면 좋겠어
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:31	Is that emily's spell book?
		에밀리 주문책이니?
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	I've been going through it since grams died.
		할머니가 돌아가신후
		읽어보고 있어
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:37	Check this out.
		이것 좀 봐
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:41	That's the vampire compass.
		뱀파이어 나침반이네
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	Yeah. According to emily, johnathan gilbert
		응. 에밀리에 의하면
		존 길버트는
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	Never actually succeeded in inventing anything.
		사실 발명에 성공하지 못했어
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	Emily secretly spelled them all with magic--
		에밀리가 몰래
		마법을 걸어놨지
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	Compass...
		나침반에
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:54	Rings...
		반지에
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:58	And the mystery device you told me about.
		그리고 네가 말했던
		미스터리한 물건에도
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:02	Yeah,that's it-- Well,part of it.
		그래, 맞아
		부품 일부야
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	Damon only has the one piece.
		데이먼이 한 부품을 갖고 있어
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	Emily pledged her loyalty to katherine.
		에밀리는 캐더린한테
		충의를 서약했어
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed.
		하지만 무고한 사람들이
		죽는걸 지켜볼 순 없었지
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	This was the only way she could think of to help--
		에밀리가 생각해낸 유일한 방법이었어
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	To let johnathan gilbert believe he'd actually invented these devices.
		조나단 길버트가 물건들을
		다 발명했다고 믿게 만드는게
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:19	Does it say what it does?
		용도는 나와있어?
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:28	Are you sure this is what isobel wants?
		이게 정말 이자벨이
		원하는거라 생각해?
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	Yeah,i'm sure.
		Why?
		응. 확실한데. 왜?
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:34	This is a weapon...
		이건 무기야
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:37	Against vampires.
		뱀파이어를 죽이는데 쓰이는
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:47	Elena!
		누나!
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	Hey.
		Um...
		제레미
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	have you seen stefan?
		I need to find him.
		스테판 봤니?
		찾아봐야 해서
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	No,not lately.
		Listen.
		못봤어. 있지
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	Um,you have a second?
		잠깐 시간 있어?
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Uh,yeah.What's up?
		What's going on?
		무슨 일이야?
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	Well,it's anna.
		애나 때문에
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	I left her all these messages,
		메세지를 남겼는데
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	And she hasn't gotten back to me-- Not even a text.
		아직 연락이 없어
		문자도
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:04	Anna?
		애나?
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
		너희 둘이 아직도
		친구사이인줄 몰랐네
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	We're more than friends.
		친구 이상이야
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	Look,something could be seriously wrong.
		뭔가 큰 일이 났을수도 있어
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	And if you know anything, you gotta tell me.
		뭐 아는거 있으면
		얘기 좀 해줘
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:15	I haven't talked to her,jer.
		얘기 못 해봤어
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	Are you lying to me right now?
		지금 나한테
		거짓말하는거야?
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Why would you say that?
		왜 그런 말을 하니?
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:21	'Cause that's what you do,elena.
		You lie.
		늘 그러잖아
		거짓말을 하지
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:23	You lie about everything.
		모든 일을
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:24	I know what anna is.
		난 애나의 정체를 알아
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	And i know that you know.
		So,tell me.
		안다는거 알고
		그러니까 말해줘
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	Do you have any idea where she is?
		어디 있는지 아냐고?
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:35	No.
		몰라
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:39	But jer...
		Jeremy.Wait.
		하지만 제레미
		기다려 봐
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	Jeremy!
		제레미!
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:47	Isobel.
		이자벨
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	What are you doing here?
		여긴 무슨 일로 왔죠?
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:51	I'm your mother,elena.
		난 네 엄마란다, 엘레나
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	I want to be more involved in your life.
		네 삶에 더욱 참여를 해야지
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	I don't want you in my life.
		그런거 원치 않아요
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	I understand that.
		You already have a lot of people that you care about.
		안다. 네가 아끼는 사람은
		이미 참 많으니까 말이지
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	But i've been studying.
		Let's see if i got this right.
		공부를 좀 해봤어
		맞는지 확인해보자
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	There is the witchy st friend bonnie.
		저기 마녀 친구 보니가 있네
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	Gonna stay away from that one.
		쟤는 이제 멀리해야 되지
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	Oh...
		Sad little brother jeremy.
		가엾은 동생 제레미
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	And there's caroline-- Obnoxious caroline.
		밉살스러운 캐롤라인이 있네
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	I got all of my info from her,by the way.
		그건 그렇고
		다 그녀한테 알아냈어
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	She had no idea who i was,and she wouldn't stop yapping.
		내가 누군지 모르니
		쉬지 않고 재잘대더군
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:27	There's matt-- Friend,ex, yappy's future ex.
		맷이 있네. 네 친구이자
		수다쟁이와 헤어질 맷
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	Lots of connections there.
		연결고리가 많지
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	- Matt's not involved with us.
		- He's involved with you.Isn't he?
		- 맷은 이 일과 상관 없어요
		- 아직도 너한테 마음이 있지?
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	Look,you shouldn't be here.
		여기 계셔선 안된다구요
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	- You need to leave.
		- No.
		- 나가주세요
		- 아니
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	I have some friends here,too.
		Look.
		나도 친구가 있어. 봐라
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:44	See that man over there standing next to matt by the float?
		맷 옆에 서있는
		남자 보이지?
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:47	His name's frank.
		He's very handsome.
		이름은 프랭크야
		아주 미남이지
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:51	And he's also very handy.
		솜씨도 좋아
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:53	And he noticed that the axle was kind of rusted, Which is very dangerous.
		굴대가 녹슨걸 발견했어
		그건 참 위험하지
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	So,all you have to do Is apply a little bit of pressure,and--
		그럴 때는 약간의
		압력을 주고...
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	No!
		안돼!
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:04	hey,get this trailer up!
		이것 좀 들어봐!
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	- Come on,guys, lift it up,please!
		- Give me a hand!
		- 어서 올려줘!
		- 도와줘!
00:23:09	 
		 
00:23:09	Come on,lift.
		어서, 들어
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:12	Come on!
		빨리!
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:17	- Call for help.
		- ok.
		- 도움 요청해
		- 알았어
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	Why are you doing this?
		왜 이러시는 거죠?
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	I'm showing you how easy it is To hurt the people that you care about.
		네가 아끼는 사람들을
		해하기 쉽단걸 보여주는거야
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:24	You're doing this just because of Johnathan gilbert's invention?
		조나단 길버트의 발명품
		때문에 이러는 거에요?
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:27	Hand it over and the fun will stop.
		건내주면 저런 재미는 멈출거야
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	I told you,damon's not gonna give it to me.
		말했죠, 데이먼이 내주질 않는다구요
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:31	And i think that you underestimate how much damon cares about you.
		데이먼이 얼마나 널
		아끼는지 잘 모르는구나
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	He'll kill you before he gives it up.
		포기하기 전에
		당신을 죽일거에요
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	Is that before or after i kill your brother jeremy?
		내가 네 동생 제레미를
		죽이기 전에 후에?
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:41	jeremy?
		제레미?
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	Jeremy!
		제레미!
00:23:45	 
		 
00:23:48	The ambulance is saying 15-20 minutes.
		응급차는 15, 20분 후에 온대
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:50	I have my car.
		I can take him to the hospital.
		나한테 차 있어
		병원에 데려갈게
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:52	Caroline can take me.
		캐롤라인이 운전할 거야
00:23:53	 
		 
00:23:53	- I didn't drive.
		- Then i'll wait.It's fine.
		- 난 차 안 가져왔어
		- 그럼 기다릴게
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	You will not wait!
		기다리면 안돼!
00:23:56	 
		 
00:23:56	Ok,you need to see a doctor.
		Tyler's driving.End of story.
		의사를 봐야 해
		타일러가 운전하고. 끝
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:00	Go!
		서둘러!
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	I'll bring my car around.
		차 가져올게
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:10	I see you're packing.
		That's a good sign.
		짐을 싸는군
		좋은 징조야
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:12	Won't be long now.
		오래 걸리지 않을거야
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	Did you get the missing piece?
		Where is it?
		잃어버린 부분은 찾았어?
		어디 있어?
00:24:16	 
		 
00:24:16	I don't have it yet.
		아직 없어
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:18	Then why did you call me here?
		그럼 왜 날
		이리로 부른거야?
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	'Cause i have the next best thing.
		더 좋은게 있으니까
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:28	What the hell are you doing?
		대체 뭐 하는거야?
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	Getting what i want.
		내가 원하는걸 얻는거지
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:30	Yeah,but he's my nephew.
		하지만 내 조카라고
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	And you're gonna let him go right this second.
		지금 바로는 놔주지 않을거고
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	The gaudy ring on your finger-- It comes off.
		네 손의 번지르르한 반지
		내줘야 겠어
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	Come on.
		Come on,isobel.I--I know you.
		왜 이래
		이자벨, 난 널 알아
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:42	Ok?
		It's me,john.
		응? 나잖아
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	You can't hurt a kid.
		저 애를 해할 수 없어
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	- I'll kill him to prove you wrong.
		- Really?
		네가 틀린걸 보여주게
		죽일거야 / 정말?
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:48	Are you that far gone?
		그렇게까지 되버렸어?
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	Look,i know you've changed. Ok?
		변한건 알아
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:53	But the old isobel is in there somewhere still. Isn't she?
		하지만 예전 모습도
		남아있지 않아?
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:59	Come on.
		Let him go.
		어서. 놔줘
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:05	(French: just do what you should do)
		(하고 싶은대로 하게)
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:08	john.
		존
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:23	nice try.
		시도 좋았어
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:25	We'll see how you do without this.
		이거 없이
		얼마나 잘버티나 보자
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:36	Where's the device?
		발명품은?
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:38	Damon has it.
		데이먼이 갖고 있어
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	He's gonna be difficult to reason with.
		설득하기 힘들거야
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:41	Then we'll--We'll go go him.
		I'll talk to him.
		그럼.. 가자
		내가 말할게
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:44	He's not just gonna hand it ov,,pecially if it's harmful to vampires.
		건내주지 않을거야
		특히 뱀파이어한테 해롭다면
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:50	What if it's not?
		아니라면?
00:25:52	 
		 
00:25:55	- absolutely not.
		- Just hear me out.
		- 전혀 안돼
		- 들어주세요
00:25:58	 
		 
00:25:58	I'm not gonna give the device To isobel so she can give it to john
		이자벨한테 줘서
		존이 가져가게?
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:01	who's gonna turn around and kill me.
		그럼 상황을 바꿔
		날 죽일텐데
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:02	I like being a living dead person.
		난 살아있는 죽은자가
		되는게 좋다구
00:26:04	 
		 
00:26:04	But it'll be useless.
		Bonnie can take its power away.
		쓸모 없어질거에요
		보니가 마법을 없애면 되니까
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:06	I don't trust her.
		난 보니 못 믿어
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	I can remove the original spell.
		내가 최초 주문을 지울 수 있어요
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	- John and isobel will never know.

00:26:14	really?
		How are you gonna do that?
		정말? 어떻게 하게?
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	Because isobel is a vampire, And jeremy can be dead the second you walk in the door.
		이자벨은 뱀파이어고 제레미는
		형이 발을 내딛는 순간 죽을수도 있는데
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:22	Are you even up for this?
		너 정말 잘 알긴 아니?
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	I mean,no offense.
		You're no emily bennett.

		넌 에밀리 베넷이 아냐
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:27	- Emily knew what she was doing.
		- I've been practicing.
		- 에밀리는 마법에 능통했지
		- 연습해왔어요
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	It's not piano lessons,honey.

00:27:02	Now,give me the device.
		발명품 줘봐요
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	We're wasting time.
		시간 낭비하지 말구요
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	I don't trust you.
		I tried to kill you.
		널 못믿어
		널 죽이려고 했었고
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	You're right.
		You can't trust me.
		맞다. 날 믿을 수 없지
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:13	But you can trust me.
		난 믿을 수 있잖아요
00:27:15

00:27:48	What is she after?
		뭘 원한대?
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:52	Your ancestor invented a weapon--
		네 조상이 무기를 발명했어
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	A device that's extremely harmful to vampires.
		뱀파이어한테 정말
		해로운 무기를
00:27:59	 
		 
00:27:59	- We've been trying to get it.
		- Why?
		- 우리가 손에 넣으려고 했었지
		- 왜요?
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	'Cause there's a group of vampires from a long time ago
		오래전에 살던
		뱀파이어 무리가
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	That wants revenge on this town.
		이 마을에 복수를 원하거든
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:10	But why-- Why would a vampire help you kill other vampires?
		하지만 왜 한 명이
		다른 무리를 죽이려 할까요?
00:28:14	 
		 
00:28:14	She has her own reasons for wanting them dead.
		다들 죽기 바라는데는
		그녀만의 이유가 있어
00:28:17	 
		 
00:28:18	Look,jeremy, No one ever thought vampires would return to this town--
		제레미, 아무도 뱀파이어가
		이 마을에 돌아오리라 생각 못했어
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:23	Not in modern times.
		현대 시대에 말야
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	But they have.
		하지만 돌아왔지
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	And we have to destroy them.
		이젠 파괴해야만 해
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	All of them?
		모두를요?
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:29	No--There are some good ones out there.
		아뇨, 착한 뱀파이어도 있다구요
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	There's no such thing.
		그런 건 없다
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:34	I don't believe that.
		난 안 믿어요
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	Well,your dad did.
		네 아버진 믿었는걸
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	And as his son,that should mean something to you.
		아들이니 너한테도
		의미가 있을텐데
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:42	How did my father know about all this?
		아빠는 어떻게
		이 모든걸 아셨죠?
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	Who do you think taught me about the family history?
		누가 우리 가문의 역사를
		알려준 것 같니?
00:28:49	 
		 
00:29:28	Done.
		끝났어
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:33	great.
		Now what?
		좋아. 이젠 어쩌지?
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:34	Now we give it to isobel.
		이자벨한테 주면 돼
00:29:36	 
		 
00:30:03	Where's the device?
		발명품은 어디있지?
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:05	Where's my brother?
		우리 동생은 어디있죠?
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	This isn't a negotiation.
		협상하는게 아냐
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	Where's the invention?
		발명품은 어디있어?
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	Where is my brother?
		제 동생은요?
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	Do you really think that i came alone?
		내가 혼자왔을것 같아?
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:18	Do you really think that i came alone?
		나도 혼자왔는줄 알아요?
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:27	For god sakes, call home.
		제발 집에 전화해
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:30	What?
		뭐라구요?
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:31	Call home,ask to speak to your brother jeremy.
		집에 전화해서
		제레미 좀 바꿔달라고 해
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:40	Hello?
		여보세요?
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	Jeremy.
		Are you ok?
		제레미. 괜찮니?
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	Yeah,yeah,i'm fine.
		Uncle john,uh, hit his head.
		응, 괜찮아
		삼촌이 머리를 다쳐서
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	It was an accident.
		And we're all laughing.
		- 사고였어
		- 다들 웃고 있고
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:52	Yeah,but,um, i'm ok.
		난 괜찮아
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	I'll be home soon, all right?
		곧 갈게
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	Yeah.
		응
00:30:59	 
		 
00:31:09	You were never going to hurt him.
		해할 의도는 없었군요
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	No.
		I was going to kill him.
		아니. 죽이려고 했었지
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	Don't look for any redeeming qualities in me.
		나한테 좋은 면을
		찾으려 애쓰지 마
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	I don't have any.
		하나도 없으니까
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	But you took a risk with damon.
		하지만 데이먼하고
		위험을 무릅썼죠
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	How did you know that he was going to give it to me?
		나한테 줄거란걸
		어떻게 아셨죠?
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:23	'Cause he's in love with you.
		데이먼은 널 사랑하니까
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:39	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	For what?
		뭐가?
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	For being such a monumental disappointment.
		정말 크게 실망시켜주셔서요
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	It keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact.
		엄마에 대한 추억은
		그대로 둘거에요
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	Good-Bye,elena.
		잘 있어라, 엘레나
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:55	As long as you have a salvatore on each arm, You're doomed.
		살바토어 형제들을 곁에 두는 한
		넌 저주받은 거야
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:01	Katherine was smart.
		캐더린은 영리했지
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	She got out.
		빠져나왔거든
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	But we all know that you're not katherine.
		하지만 넌 캐더린과 다르지
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:49	Hey,it's anna.
		Leave a message.
		애나에요
		메세지 남겨주세요
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:55	Jeremy,we have to talk about this.
		제레미, 얘기 좀 하자
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	No,we really don't.
		아니, 할 필요 없어
00:32:59	 
		 
00:33:00	I don't know what anna told you, But there are things that you need to know.
		애나가 뭐라고 했는지 모르지만
		네가 알아야 할 것들이 있어
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	Yeah?
		Because...
		그래? 왜냐면
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	I'm pretty sure that your journal covered it.
		일기장으로 다 알아냈거든
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:12	You read my journal?
		내 일기 읽었어?
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:13	And save me the speech about invasion of privacy,
		사생활 침해 얘기는 꺼내지도 마
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	Because i read a section about damon erasing my memory, About what happened to vicki.
		내 기억을 지운거나 비키한테
		생긴 일에 대한 부분 읽었으니까
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:19	Jeremy,please, you don't understand.
		제레미, 제발
		넌 이해를 못해
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	The night that vicki died,
		비키가 죽은 날 밤
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:26	It was like mom and dad died all over again.
		부모님이 죽은 때로
		돌아가는것 같았어
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:28	It was all over your face.
		네 표정에 나타나 있었지
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:30	And it hurt so much to see you like that.
		그런 모습을 보기
		너무 아팠어
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:32	I just wanted to take away your pain, I'm so sorry.
		고통을 씻어주고 싶었어
		정말 미안해
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:35	Just get out.
		그냥 나가
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	- No,jeremy--
		- Elena!
		- 제레미
		- 누나!
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:40	Just get out.
		Please.

00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:55	Jer,i--
		제레미..
00:33:57	 
		 
00:34:21	What do you want?
		원하는게 뭐야?
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	I totally get it.
		이해해
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	You here as a history teacher.
		역사선생님으로 여기 온거지
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:29	- It's good.
		- What the hell are you doing?
		- 좋아
		- 대체 뭐하는거야?
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:31	You act like you don't care, And yet here you are hunting me down.
		신경 안쓰는 척 하면서
		날 뒤쫓고 있잖아
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:39	I'm leaving.
		떠날거야
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	I just thought i'd say good-Bye.
		작별인사 하고 싶었어
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:43	Well,you couldn't be bothered the first time, So why now?
		처음엔 신경도 안쓰더니
		왜 지금 그래?
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	You hate me,good.
		날 미워하는군, 좋아
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	Does that make it easier for you?
		그럼 더 편하든?
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	I mean,what is the whole point of this exercise?
		대체 꿍꿍이가 뭐야?
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:52	What did you expect?
		뭘 기대했어?
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:53	You spent alalalisyingngngngngn, What did you think you would find?
		몇년간 날 찾아 다닌거
		뭘 찾을거라 생각했어?
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:56	The woman who gave me this...
		나한테 이걸 준 여자는
00:34:59	 
		 
00:34:59	I mean,you act like you don't care.
		신경도 안쓰는 척을 하면서
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:01	But you cared enough to protect me after you left.
		떠날 때 날 지켜주려 신경써줬지
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:04	I was a different person back then.
		그때 난 다른 사람이었어
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	right, right,right.
		And that person is gone.
		맞아. 그 사람은 죽었지
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	The woman i married, the woman i loved, she's just--She's gone.
		내가 결혼하고 내가 사랑한
		여자는.. 죽었어
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:15	You expect me to believe that?
		그걸 믿으라고?
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:23	What are you doing?
		뭐하는거야?
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	Well,i'm ring-Free.
		반지도 없겠다
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:26	I'm vervain-Free, So either kill me or compel me, Because...
		마편초도 없으니
		날 죽이든 주문걸든
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:32	I don't believe it.
		믿지 않을거야
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:35	Not for a second.
		하나도
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:40	I wanted this.
		내가 원했어
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	I needed this.
		이게 필요했고
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:47	And i'm going to regret it forever.
		난 평생 후회할거야
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:52	This was my mistake.
		내 실수였지
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:56	Not yours.
		당신 잘못이 아냐
00:35:59	 
		 
00:36:03	You are not going to remember this.
		당신은 이제 기억하지 않을것이다
00:36:06

00:36:09	I did. and when I ***
		정말. 내가 포기한걸
		생각하면 마음 아프지만
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:14	But that's in the past now, And your heart's free of me.
		이젠 다 과거라
		당신 마음은 날 지웠어
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	It's better this way.
		이 편이 더 나아
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:21	Good-Bye,rick.
		잘 있어, 릭
00:36:24	 
		 
00:37:02	Anna?

00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:34	Hey,it's ok.
		괜찮아
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:44	Would you like one?
		한 잔 마실래?

00:37:48	Say it.
		Whatever it is, purge,get it out.
		말해봐
		뭐든지 털어내라고
00:37:53	 
		 
00:37:54	- It's about what isobel said.
		- What about it?
		- 이자벨이 한 얘기
		- 그게 뭐?
00:37:58	 
		 
00:37:58	Well,i know that you and elena bonded,
		엘레나랑 형이
		가까워진건 아는데
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	And i know that she cares about you,and,uh,

		형이 엘레나를
		아끼는 것도 알아
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	Well,this is going in an interesting direction.
		흥미로운 방향으로 흘러가는군
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:08	I'm just concerned about elena being hurt.
		엘레나가 상처 받을까봐 걱정돼
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	She considers you a friend.
		형을 친구로 생각하는데
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:13	Same here.
		Elena's a very good friend.
		나도 마찬가지야
		엘레나는 좋은 친구지
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:15	Actually, she might qualify as my only friend.
		사실, 내 유일한 친구로
		부를 수 있을걸
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:19	Is that a problem?
		문제가 되니?
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:21	So,at the risk of sounding like a,um,
		이 말이..
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:24	- Like a jealous boyfriend--
		- Oh,there's no risk.You do.
		- 질투하는것처럼 들릴수도 있는데
		- 그렇진 않아. 질투하는게 맞으니
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	History will not be repeating itself Where elena's concerned.
		엘레나를 두고는
		과거를 반복하지 않겠지
00:38:34
