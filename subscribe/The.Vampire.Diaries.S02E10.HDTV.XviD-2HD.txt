00:00:01	Previously on "the vampire diaries"...
		지난 이야기
00:00:02	 
		Vampires and werewolves
		used to roam freely
		 
		뱀파이어랑 늑대인간은
		자유롭게 방랑하였지
00:00:04	 
		until a shaman put a curse
		on them to limit their power.
		 
		무당이 그들의 힘을 억제하려
		저주를 걸기 전까진
00:00:06	 
		Since then, werewolves can only 
		 turn on a full moon
		 
		그 후로, 늑대인간은
		보름달에만 변하고
00:00:08	 
		and vampires are weakened by the sun.
		 
		뱀파이어는 햇빛 아래에 약해지지
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	The werewolf part of the curse
		 is sealed with a moonstone.
		늑대인간의 저주는
		월장석에 봉인돼지
00:00:13	 
		He told me about your ex, Katherine.
		 
		네 전여친
		캐더린에 대해 말해줘
00:00:15	 
		You must be Elena.
		 
		네가 엘레나구나
00:00:16	 
		How do we look exactly alike?
		 
		우린 어떻게
		똑같이 생긴거죠?
00:00:18	 
		The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
		 
		저주를 깨는 건
		월장석이에요
00:00:20	 
		Sacrifice is what breaks it. 
		The blood of the doppelganger.
		 
		제물이 있어야 깰 수 있어
		도플갱어의 피 말야
00:00:22	 
		You're the doppelganger.
		 
		네가 바로 그 도플갱어이고
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:24	Don't! You need me. Elena's in danger.
		안 돼! 내가 필요해
		엘레나가 위험하다구
00:00:26	 
		- Klaus is the real deal. - Who is he?
		 
		- 클라우스가 더 무시무시하지
		- 클라우스가 누구죠?
00:00:27	 
		One of the first generation of vampires.
		 
		뱀파이어 1세대 중 한명
00:00:29	 
		The oldest vampire in the history of time
		 is coming after me?
		 
		역사상 가장 오래된 뱀파이어가
		날 쫓고 있다구요?
00:00:32	 
		Luka.
		 
		루카
00:00:33	 
		I'd like to introduce you to my dad.
		 
		아버지 소개할게
00:00:34	 
		Jonas Martin.
		 
		조나스 마틴이네
00:00:36	 
		You're a witch?
		 
		마녀야?
00:00:36	 
		We prefer the term "Warlock".
		 
		'마술사'란 말을
		더 선호하는데
00:00:39	 
		Elijah. One of the originals.
		 
		1세대 중 한명인
		일라이자
00:00:41	 
		He's a legend.
		 
		전설이야
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	You got in touch with Elijah. How'd you do it?
		일라이자와 어떻게
		연락을 한거지?
00:00:44	 
		A guy named slater, in Richmond.
		 
		리치몬드에 사는
		슬레이터란 남자를 통해
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:46	You can destroy the curse, 
		but you need the moonstone.
		저주를 푸는게 가능해
		그러기 위해선 월장석이 필요해
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:53	He delivered his message.
		메세지를 전달했네
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:55	It won't be long now.
		오래 걸리진 않겠어
00:00:56	 
		 
00:01:58	Elena.
		엘레나
00:01:59	 
		 
00:02:00	I heard something.
		무슨 소리가 났는데
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:05	That was us.
		우리였어
00:02:06	 
		 
00:02:08	I'm sorry.
		미안하구나
00:02:09	 
		 
00:02:09	We didn't think anyone was up...
		깨어있을줄 모르고..
00:02:11	 
		But here you are... You're ...
		 
		하지만 네가 여기..
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:15	We were just...
		우린 그냥..
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:20	Chunky monkey?
		시리얼 먹을래?
00:02:21	 
		 
00:02:23	I didn't... really hungry... at all.
		아뇨.. 전 별로..
		배가 안 고파요
00:02:27	 
		 
00:02:30	I'm naked.
		옷도 안 입고 있으니
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:33	So I'm gonna go.
		가봐야겠다
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:39	I'm really, really sorry.
		정말 미안해
00:02:42	 
		 
00:02:42	It's ok, Jenna, don't worry about it.
		괜찮아, 제나
		걱정하지 마
00:02:44	 
		I know he's been staying over a lot.
		 
		요즘 우리집에서
		자고 가는 일이 많은데
00:02:46	 
		Are you-- are you sure it's ok?
		 
		너 정말 괜찮니?
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	Seems like things are good.
		요즘 사이가 좋나봐
00:02:49	 
		 
00:02:51	They're extremely good.
		정말 좋지
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:53	Then I'm extremely ok with it.
		그럼 난 정말 괜찮아
00:02:55

00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:38	Let's do it.
		어서 하자
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:43	1, 2, 3.
		하나 둘 셋
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:50	Can we talk?
		얘기 좀 할 수 있을까?
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:53	Why?
		왜?
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	We went to see Katherine.
		우리 캐더린 보러 갔었어
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:58	Come on in.
		들어와
00:03:59	 
		 
00:04:06	Please...
		제발
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:08	Come on in.
		어서 들어와
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:10	There's plenty of room for all of us.
		우리 셋이 지낼
		공간은 많으니
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	I'd rather poke my eyes out.
		내 눈알을 뽑는게 낫겠다
00:04:14	 
		Mmm, they're such pretty eyes.
		 
		예쁜 눈을 왜
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:17	We're here for the moonstone.
		월장석 때문에 온거야
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:19	Feel like tossing it over?
		넘겨줄 의향 있어?
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:21	Tell you what. Hmm.
		있지
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	You get your little witch to hocus
		 pocus me out of here,
		네 마녀를 불러
		날 여기서 나오게 해주면
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	You can have whatever you want.
		원하는 데로 다 해줄게
00:04:28	 
		I thought you liked it in here.
		 
		안에 있는게 좋은 줄 알았는데
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	Nice and safe, where Klaus can't get to you.
		편하고 안전한데다
		클라우스가 잡을 수 없으니까
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	I've had time to reconsider.
		다시 생각해볼 시간이 있었어
00:04:34	 
		Meaning you're hungry.
		 
		배가 고프시단 뜻이군
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:36	I'm starving, Damon.
		굶어 죽고 있어, 데이먼
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	And dirty. But above all, I'm bored.
		더러운데다가
		무엇보다 지루해 죽겠어
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	At least running from Klaus isn't boring.
		최소한 클라우스로부터
		도망치는 건 안 지겹잖아
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:44	So here's the deal--
		이렇게 하자
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:46	You get me out of here, you get the moonstone
		여기서 나오게 해주면
		월장석을 얻고
00:04:48	 
		And I'll disappear from mystic falls forever.
		 
		미스틱 폴즈에서
		영원히 사라져줄게
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:53	Let me know what you decide.
		결정하면 알려줘
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:56	You don't believe her, do you?
		캐더린 말을 믿는건 아니겠죠?
00:04:57	 
		No, of course not. 
		We just want the moonstone.
		 
		물론 안 믿지
		우린 월장석을 원할 뿐야
00:04:59	 
		According to Rose's friend Slater,
		 
		로즈의 친구
		슬레이터에 의하면
00:05:01	 
		there's a way to destroy the spell that 
		Klaus wants to break.
		 
		클라우스가 깨고 싶은
		주문을 풀 방법이 있어
00:05:03	 
		No spell, no doppelganger sacrifice.
		 
		주문이나
		도플갱어 제물이 필요 없지
00:05:06	 
		Ergo, you live.
		 
		그러므로 넌 살 수 있는거지
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	How do you destroy it?
		어떻게 깨는거죠?
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	By releasing it from the moonstone.
		월장석의 봉인을 푸는거야
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:14	How do you guys even know
		 this is gonna work?
		효과가 있을지 어떻게 알아?
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	'cause we have a crafty witch on our side.
		우리한텐 기술 좋은
		마녀가 있으니까
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:19	You discussed it with Bonnie.
		보니와 상의했군요
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	She agreed to anything she could to help us.
		어떻게든 돕겠다고 동의했어
00:05:23	 
		It's Katherine who has the moonstone.
		 
		월장석을 가진건 캐더린이에요
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	She's not going to give it to you.
		그냥 주진 않을거에요
00:05:26	 
		We're gonna get it from her.
		 
		얻어낼거야
00:05:27	 
		Well, what he means to say
		 
		스테판의 뜻은
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	is that we will pry it from her cold, dead hand
		필요 하다면
		그녀의 차가운 손에서
00:05:31	 
		if we have to.
		 
		월장석을 빼낼거란 거야
00:05:32	 
		Bonnie just needs to find a way to release
		 
		보니는 그저
		우리가 들어간 동안
00:05:34	 
		the seal long enough for us to get in,
		 
		무덤의 주문을 풀면
00:05:36	 
		get the moonstone and get out in time
		 
		월장석을 가지고
00:05:38	 
		for her to return it.
		 
		제 시간에 나오면 되는거지
00:05:38	 
		Wow. I mean, it sounds
		 
		와. 정말 다 계획했나 보군요
00:05:40	 
		like you guys already have it all planned out.
		 
		와. 정말 다 계획했나 보군요
00:05:41	 
		Yep. We're awesome.
		 
		그래. 우린 좀 짱이지
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	Except for one thing.
		한가지 빼구요
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:46	I don't want you to do it.
		그러지 않았음 좋겠어
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:51	What are you talking about?
		무슨 말이야?
00:05:51	 
		Elena, we don't have a choice.
		 
		엘레나, 선택권이 없어
00:05:53	 
		- What about Klaus? - We'll find him,
		 
		- 클라우스는?
		- 우리가 찾을거야
00:05:54	 
		but after we get the moonstone.
		 
		월장석 찾은 후에 말야
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	Is that before or after he kills everyone
		 that I care about,
		내가 아끼는 모든 사람들을
		다 죽이기 전이야 후야?
00:05:59	 
		including the two of you?
		 
		여기 둘을 포함해서 말예요
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:01	Elena, if we can de-spell the moonstone,
		엘레나, 우리가
		월장석 주문을 깰 있다면
00:06:03	 
		We can save your life.
		 
		네 목숨을 구할 수 있어
00:06:04	 
		I know. Everybody keeps saying that.
		 
		알아. 다들 그 말만 하네
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:11	So your grams waited until 
		you were in high school
		할머니는 고등학교 올라가서야
00:06:13	 
		to tell you that you're a witch?
		 
		마녀란 사실을 말해준거야?
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Well, she brought it up before
		 but I just thought
		그 전에도 얘기를 꺼내셨지만
00:06:18	 
		she was drunk.
		 
		술취해 하는 소린줄 알았지
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:20	In my defense, she was.
		항변을 하자면
		술을 좋아하셨거든
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	So then, you're, like, new?
		그럼 넌 신입과 다름 없구나?
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:25	New-ish.
		그렇지
00:06:26	 
		I still have some growing pains.
		 
		아직 성장통이 좀 있어
00:06:27	 
		Like?
		 
		예를 들면?
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	Physically,
		육체적으로
00:06:30	 
		it's become a lot harder.
		 
		더 힘들어져
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:33	I have a bad reaction to it sometimes.
		가끔 역반응이 생기더라
00:06:35	 
		Your nose bleeds?
		 
		코피가 나니?
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:38	Yeah.
		응
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	I pass out sometimes.
		가끔은 쓰러져
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:42	It's 'cause you're trying to do too
		 much on your own.
		너 혼자 많은걸
		해내려고 해서야
00:06:43	 
		You need help.
		 
		도움이 필요한거지
00:06:45	 
		 
00:06:45	From what?
		무엇으로부터?
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	From nature.
		자연이나
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:48	The elements.
		원소들
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	Just things that you can draw
		 extra power from.
		네가 추가적인 힘을
		끌어낼 수 있는 사물들로부터
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:52	Have you ever channeled
		 another witch before?
		너 다른 마녀와
		통한적(channel) 있어?
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:56	What is that?
		그게 뭐야?
00:06:56	 
		Say we put our energy together.
		 
		그러니까 우린
		힘을 합쳐서
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	We can double our strength.
		마법의 힘을 두 배로
		증가시킬 수 있지
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:01	I'll show you, watch.
		보여줄게
00:07:02	 
		Let me see that bracelet.
		 
		팔찌 좀 줘봐
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:09	Take this.
		이거 갖고 있어
00:07:10	 
		Now I want you to stand very still
		 
		이제 가만히 서서
00:07:12	 
		- and concentrate. - I don't get it.
		 
		- 집중해
		- 이해가 안 가
00:07:14	 
		- Ok. I know, it's, I-- - What are we doing?
		 
		- 알아, 그게
		- 뭐하는거야?
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	We're channeling.
		힘을 통하는 중이지
00:07:16	 
		The personal items will act as a talisman.
		 
		소지품은
		부적같은 역할을 해
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	Now concentrate.
		이제 집중해
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:28	What is that?
		방금 뭐지?
00:07:29	 
		 
00:08:09	Pretty cool, huh?
		꽤 멋지지?
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:16	What's with that weather, huh?
		날씨가 왜 이런데?
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:18	It's global warming, man.
		지구 온난화 덕이지
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:21	I don't know.
		모르겠다
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:23	I gotta go.
		가봐야겠다
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:25	- See ya later, Bonnie. - Bye, Luka.
		- 나중에 봐 보니
		- 잘 가, 루카
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	Bye.
		안녕
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:30	That guy is weird, huh?
		좀 이상한 것 같지 않아?
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	No, he's not.
		전혀
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:43	What is it?
		그게 뭐야?
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:45	It's Damon.
		데이먼
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:52	It's not nice to leave a
		아침에 속옷 바람으로 두고
		떠나는 건 예의가 아니지
00:08:53	 
		girl naked so early in the morning.
		아침에 속옷 바람으로 두고
		떠나는 건 예의가 아니지
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:57	Whoa.
		와
00:08:58	 
		Sorry, I thought you were...
		 
		미안, 난..
00:08:59	 
		 
00:09:01	I, uh, sorry, I...
		미안해요
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:04	There's no one else here.
		아무도 없어
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	Actually, I came to talk to you.
		사실, 그쪽하고
		얘기 좀 하러 왔어요
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:11	Then I should probably get dressed.
		그럼 옷 좀 갈아입어야 겠네
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:16	- It's a bad idea. - No, it's not.
		- 나쁜 생각이야
		- 아뇨
00:09:18	 
		From what Stefan told me,
		 
		스테판이 그러길
00:09:19	 
		Your friend Slater
		 
		당신 친구 슬레이터가
00:09:20	 
		obviously has more information about Klaus.
		 
		클라우스에 대한 정보를
		더 입수한 모양이더군요
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	And you and Damon just gave up
		 before you got it.
		당신과 데이먼은
		포기 직전이었구요
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	Because somebody blew up a coffee 
		shop with us in it.
		누군가 우리가 있는
		커피숍을 폭발시켰으니
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:28	There's more to learn.
		알아야할게 더 많아요
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	We just have to find a way to learn it.
		알아낼 방법을 찾아내야만 하죠
00:09:31	 
		Why are you coming to me with this?
		 
		왜 그걸 갖고
		나한테 찾아오는 거지?
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:34	Because you owe me.
		저한테 빚을 졌잖아요
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	One word from me, and Damon and Stefan
		내가 말만 하면
		데이먼과 스테판은
00:09:37	 
		could have killed you for kidnapping me.
		 
		날 납치한 죄로
		당신을 죽일 수 있다구요
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	Or maybe it's because you
		아니면 그 둘은
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	know that they wouldn't want you doing this.
		네가 이러는 걸 원치 않으니
		이러는 거겠지
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:44	And their moonstone caper
		월장석을 갖고 튄 캐더린 덕에
		몰래 빠져나올 기회가 생겼구나
00:09:45	 
		gives you a chance to sneak away.
		월장석을 갖고 튄 캐더린 덕에
		몰래 빠져나올 기회가 생겼구나
00:09:46	 
		We're having a disagreement, okay?
		 
		의견이 안 맞군요
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:49	They're willing to risk everyone 
		that I love, and I'm not.
		내가 사랑하는 모든 사람이
		위험해지는건 괜찮지 않다구요
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:53	They're just trying to protect you.
		그저 너만 지키려고 하지
00:09:54	 
		And you've proven that you
		 
		당신은 내가 안전하든 안 하든
		신경 안쓴단 걸 증명하셨구요
00:09:55	 
		can't care less whether I'm protected or not.
		 
		당신은 내가 안전하든 안 하든
		신경 안쓴단 걸 증명하셨구요
00:09:58	 
		So we're back to you taking me to Slater.
		 
		그러니까 날 슬레이터한테
		데려가줘요
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:03	What exactly do you have to achieve by this?
		가서 뭘 하려는건데?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:07	How would you like to be able to 
		walk during the daylight?
		햇빛 아래 다닐 수 있다면
		어떨 것 같아요?
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:12	I've been a slave to shadows for 500 years.
		난 그림자의 노예로
		500년을 살았어
00:10:14	 
		What do you think?
		 
		내 심정이 어떨 것 같아?
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:16	I think I know a witch who's willing to do
		도움이 된다면 뭐든 해줄
		마녀를 알고 있어요
00:10:18	 
		whatever it takes to help,
		도움이 된다면 뭐든 해줄
		마녀를 알고 있어요
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:20	If you're willing to make a deal.
		거래를 하고 싶으시다면 말이죠
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:35	Hey, man. How you doing?
		안녕. 잘 지냈어?
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:38	Good, you?
		그래, 넌?
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:40	I'm pissed at myself for picking a fight with you.
		너랑 싸움을 붙인
		나 자신에 화났어
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:43	And feeling guilty for what happened to Sarah.
		새라한테 생긴 일 때문에
		죄책감도 들고
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:46	I've been dodging you for days
		난 며칠간 널 피해다녔어
00:10:47	 
		'cause I didn't know what to say to you.
		 
		뭐라고 말해야할지 몰라서
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:49	Don't worry about it, man.
		걱정 마
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	I'm really sorry.
		정말 미안하다
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:55	Please know that.
		알아줬음 좋겠어
00:10:56	 
		 
00:11:03	Matt.
		맷
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:05	Hey.
		캐롤라인
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:07	How are you?
		좀 어때?
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:09	I--I've been better.
		좀.. 나아졌어
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:15	I gotta--
		나..
00:11:15	 
		I gotta get to class.
		 
		수업 들으러 가봐야겠다
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:18	Ok.
		알았어
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:24	Are you two still on the outs?
		둘이 아직 화해 안했어?
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	Looks like it.
		그런 것 같네
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:28	You realize there's almost a full moon?
		보름달 뜰 때가
		가까워진 거 알아?
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:31	Vampires don't have enough problems, 
		you want to take on mine?
		뱀파이어의 문제도 벅찬데
		내 일에도 신경 쓰시려고?
00:11:33	 
		Have you even thought about it?
		 
		생각해봤니?
00:11:35	 
		The whole...wolf thing?
		 
		변하는 거 말야
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	Do you know what you're going to do?
		어떻게 할지 생각해봤어?
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:41	I'll be fine.
		멀쩡할거야
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:44	Well?
		말 안 해줘?
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:46	It's kind of private.
		사적인 일이라
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:48	I'm student council vice president,
		난 학생회 부회장이야
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Head of the prom committee, not to mention
		졸업파티 위원회장이고
00:11:51	 
		I single-handedly organized 
		this town's clean up campaign.
		 
		난 마을 청소 캠페인을
		혼자서 해결했다고
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	You're really going to turn down my help?
		정말로 내 도움을 거절하겠단거야?
00:11:56	 
		 
00:12:00	I might be able to lower the tomb spell
		무덤의 주문을 약화시켜
00:12:02	 
		long enough for you to get in there
		 
		안으로 들어가서
00:12:03	 
		and grab the moonstone from Katherine.
		 
		월장석을 뺏어올 정도는
		할 수 있을거야
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:06	How? It took both you and your grams last time,
		어떻게? 지난 번엔
		할머니까지 필요했잖아
00:12:08	 
		and look what happened to her.
		 
		누나 할머님이 어떻게 됐나 봐봐
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	I'm well aware of what happened.
		그 날 일은 잘 알고 있어
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	- But I've learned a few new things. - Bonnie...
		- 배운 것도 있고
		- 보니..
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:15	- How will you get it? - She hasn't been feeding.
		- 어떻게 뺏으려고?
		- 피를 못 마신지 오래됐어
00:12:17	 
		She's weaker. We're not.
		 
		- 약해졌어
		- 우린 반대고
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	You wouldn't be underestimating her, 
		would you?
		과소평가하는 거 아냐?
00:12:21	 
		It's a plan.
		 
		계획이야
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:23	Is it perfect?
		완벽하냐고?
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	What plan is?
		완벽한 계획이란게 있던가?
00:12:25	 
		Let me do it. I've got my ring. I can get in,
		 
		내가 할게요
		반지도 꼈겠다 들어가서
00:12:27	 
		get out, no spells necessary.
		 
		나오면 주문이 필요 없잖아요
00:12:29	 
		Thanks, you 16-year-old child.
		 
		고맙다, 16살 어린애야
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	Why didn't we think about that?
		그 생각은 왜 못했을까?
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:34	Why are you even here?
		넌 왜 여기 있는거고?
00:12:35	 
		Maybe I can help better the plan.
		 
		계획이 잘 이뤄지게
		도울 수 있어요
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:38	Do you have anything that belongs to Katherine?
		캐더린의 소유품
		혹시 없나요?
00:12:41	 
		 
00:13:00	Slater!
		슬레이터?
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:02	Slater, it's Rose. Open up.
		슬레이터, 로즈야
		문 열어
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:06	He's not home. Sorry.
		집에 없네
00:13:07	 
		No. We didn't come all the way out
		 here for nothing.
		 
		안돼요. 헛수고 하려고
		온 게 아니라구요
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:19	After you.
		뒤따르죠
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:25	Slater?
		슬레이터?
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:36	I don't think he's going to be much help.
		별로 도움이 될 것 같지 않은데
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:59	It looks like whoever blew up the coffee shop
		커피숍을 폭발시킨 놈이 누구든
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:02	found him and killed him for his information.
		정보를 입수한 슬레이터를
		찾아서 죽였나보군
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	Yeah, probably to stop him from
		 helping people like us.
		네, 우리 같은 사람을
		돕지 못하게 말이죠
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:07	The guy was a vampire almanac.
		 Knowing too much information
		뱀파이어의 연감이나 다름없었지
		너무 많은 걸 알면
00:14:09	 
		just bit him in the ass.
		 
		큰코다치는 거야
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:20	- What are you - Tempered glass.
		- 어떻게
		- 강화유리야
00:14:22	 
		 
00:14:22	U.V. Rays can't penetrate.
		자외선은 통과 못하지
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:26	I used to just come here and watch the day.
		여기 와서 낮 경치를 보곤 했는데
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:33	I'm sorry about Slater.
		슬레이터 일은 유감이에요
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:36	Any luck?
		찾은 거라도?
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:41	It's password protected, I can't get in.
		암호 보호가 있어서
		들어갈 수 없어요
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	No, this is fine. Let's just go.
		괜찮아
		그냥 가자
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:48	Stay here.
		여기 있어
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:58	Alice?
		앨리스?
00:14:59	 
		 
00:15:00	Rose!
		로즈!
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:05	He's dead!
		그가 죽었어!
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:08	This belonged to Katherine.
		캐더린 꺼야
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:10	Found it with her things after
		 I thought she was dead,
		죽은 줄 알고
		소지품을 뒤지다 발견했지
00:15:12	 
		but it was hers.
		 
		캐더린거였어
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:44	What will this do?
		이걸로 뭘 하려고?
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:46	I can turn the metal to ash.
		난 금속도 재로 만들 수 있어요
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:51	Blow the ashes on her,
		이 재를 캐더린에게 뿌리면
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:53	and it'll incapacitate her for a minute or two.
		몇 분 간은
		능력을 잃을 거에요
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:56	Long enough for you
		그 동안 당신은
00:15:57	 
		to get the stone and get out.
		 
		월장석을 찾아
		나오면 되죠
00:15:59	 
		 
00:16:07	Matt's bumming pretty hard.
		맷은 꽤 크게
		충격 받았나봐
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:09	I know.
		알아
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:11	It's better this way.
		이 편이 더 나아
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:14	I get it.
		이해해
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	You do?
		정말?
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:17	Yeah.
		그래
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:19	You can't be honest with him.
		솔직할 수 없잖아
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:21	And it's not really fair to be with someone
		정체를 숨긴채로
00:16:22	 
		and not really let them know who you are.
		 
		만나는 건 공평치 않잖아
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:28	I get it.
		이해해
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:30	Head over here.
		이리 와봐
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	There's a cellar that goes to our old property.
		오래된 사유지로 통하는
		지하실이 있어
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:34	I know.
		알아
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	You do?
		안다고?
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:38	I know that this is the old Lockwood property.
		이 곳이 예전 락우드가
		땅이라는 걸 안다구
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:46	Watch your step.
		계단 조심해
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:52	I'm guessing this is where
		바로 여기가
00:16:52	 
		Mason was headed the night he turned.
		 
		삼춘이 변하는 날 밤에
		향했던 곳인가봐
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:55	It's this way.
		이 쪽이야
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:58	Did Mason tell you about this place?
		네 삼촌이 이 곳에 대해 얘기해줬니?
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	Mason bolted before I triggered the curse,
		삼촌은 저주가 시작되기 전에
		사라졌지만
00:17:02	 
		but I found these.
		 
		내가 찾아냈지
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:16	They look old.
		오래된 것 같다
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:18	And these bolts and chains.
		사슬과 고정대 좀 봐
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	I need new chains, but the bolts could still hold.
		새로운 사슬이 필요해
		고정대는 괜찮겠네
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:26	I think that's what this place is used for.
		무엇에 쓰였는지 알겠어
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:29	For full moons.
		보름달이 뜰 때 숨는 곳
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:40	What's this?
		이건 뭐야?
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:48	I have no idea.
		모르겠어
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:55	It was Mason's.
		메이슨 꺼야
00:17:56	 
		 
00:18:02	"August 31st--
		'8월 31일'
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:04	My body is changing.
		'내 신체가 변하고 있다'
00:18:05	 
		I'm edgy, I'm angry, impatient.
		 
		'예민하고 화가 나고
		침착하기 힘들다'
00:18:08	 
		I get so mad, I black out
		 
		'노한 후에 쓰러지며'
00:18:10	 
		and forget what I say or do.
		 
		'내가 했던 말과 행동을 잊는다'
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:12	I'm not myself,
		'난 예전의 내가 아니다'
00:18:13	 
		not since Jimmy's death.
		 
		'지미가 죽은 이후로'
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:16	What's happening to me?"
		'나한테 무슨 일이 일어난 걸까?'
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:20	He chronicled everything.
		모든 걸 기록해놨어
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:25	Full moon is tonight.
		'오늘 밤에
		보름달이 뜬다'
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	Well, does he say what happened?
		무슨 일이 생겼는지 써있어?
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:43	Better get the torches.
		햇불 좀 가져와
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	Alaric's stake gun's in my trunk. Bonnie?
		알라릭의 말뚝 총은
		트렁크에 있단다, 보니
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:48	Go ahead.
		어서 가봐
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	I'm almost done.
		거의 다 했어
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:58	What are you doing?
		뭐 하는거야?
00:18:59	 
		Hey, you're not strong enough.
		 
		아직 누나는 약해
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:06	I'll be fine.
		괜찮을 거야
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:08	You could get hurt.
		다칠 수도 있다고
00:19:09	 
		And Elena could die.
		 
		엘레나가 죽을 수도 있다구
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	I'll be fine.
		난 괜찮을거야
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:15	Promise.
		약속해
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:17	I promise.
		약속할게
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:22	Here, I got this, OK?
		내가 보고 있을게
00:19:24	 
		Go get me, um, go get me something
		 
		재를 담아둘 병 좀 가져와
00:19:26	 
		to put this in.
		 
		재를 담아둘 병 좀 가져와
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:28	All right?
		알았지?
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:55	She found him a few minutes before we did.
		우리가 오기 몇 분 전에 발견했대
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:58	How is she?
		어때요?
00:19:59	 
		Overreacting. Big time.
		 
		오버 중이지
		심하게
00:20:01	 
		Her boyfriend just died.
		 
		남친이 죽었다구요
00:20:02	 
		There's no such thing as overreacting.
		 
		오버라고 할 것 까지야
00:20:04	 
		Those tears are for her.
		 
		저건 이기적인 눈물이야
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	She didn't care about Slater.
		슬레이터는 신경도 안썼지
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:07	She was only dating him
		그와 사귀었던 이유는
00:20:08	 
		long enough to see if he'd turn her.
		 
		뱀파이어로 변하고 싶어서였어
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:20	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:25	You look really familiar.
		낯이 익네요
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:28	Did you know Slater?
		슬레이터와 알던 사이인가요?
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:30	Not personally, no.
		개인적으로는 몰랐어요
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:33	I just knew that he kept
		제가 알던 건
00:20:35	 
		detailed records of all of his vampire contacts,
		 
		알고 지낸 뱀파이어들을
		상세히 기록해놨단 거죠
00:20:37	 
		and I was hoping that he could
		 point me towards Klaus.
		 
		클라우스를 찾을 방법을
		알려주길 바랐는데
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	Doubtful.
		글쎄요
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:42	Klaus doesn't want to be pointed out.
		클라우스는
		지목당하길 원치 않죠
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	Do you know Slater's computer password?
		슬레이터 컴퓨터 비번 아세요?
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:47	Are you seriously asking me that right now?
		진짜 지금 그걸 물어보는 거에요?
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:50	I just saw my boyfriend
		난 지금 남자친구가
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	with a stake through his heart.
		말뚝에 박혀 죽은 모습을 봤다구요
00:20:53	 
		I understand that.
		 
		이해해요
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:55	Do you know his password?
		비밀번호 아세요?
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:58	Who do you think you are?
		당신 누군줄 알고 그래?
00:20:59	 
		 
00:21:05	What if I could convince Rose to turn you?
		로즈한테 부탁해서
		뱀파이어로 만들어 준다면요?
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:10	Will you show us his files then?
		그 때는 파일을 보여주실 건가요?
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:14	Someone's been here.
		누군가 여기 왔었네요
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:15	The hard drive's completely wiped out.
		하드 드라이브가
		완전히 지워졌어요
00:21:16	 
		Yeah, probably whoever killed him.
		 
		그를 죽인 사람 짓이겠죠
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:18	Lucky for you, Slater was paranoid.
		운 좋게 슬레이터는
		편집증 환자라
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Everything's backed up on our remote server.
		모든걸 외부 서버에
		백업시켜놨죠
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:24	You know that she's not going
		내가 저 여자를 바꿀 가능성은
		전혀 없는거 알지?
00:21:25	 
		anywhere near my blood, right?
		내가 저 여자를 바꿀 가능성은
		전혀 없는거 알지?
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	I know. She doesn't.
		난 알아요
		저 분이 모를 뿐이지
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:35	Kristin Stewart.
		크리스틴 스튜어트
		(트와일라잇 여주인공)
00:21:36	 
		God, was he obvious.
		 
		뻔하군
00:21:38	 
		These are all links to vampires?
		 
		저게 다 뱀파이어들의
		이메일인가요?
00:21:40	 
		Slater was obsessed, almost as much as me.
		 
		슬레이터는 나만큼이나
		집착이 심했죠
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	What about that one? Cody Webber.
		저건 뭐죠?
		코디 웨버
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:47	We exchanged dozens of emails about Elijah.
		일라이자에 대한 수십통
		이메일을 주고받았군요
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	I could call him.
		내가 전화해 드릴까요?
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:54	Tell him that we're trying
		클라우스한테 메세지를
		전하고 싶다고 말해줘요
00:21:54	 
		to send a message to Klaus.
		클라우스한테 메세지를
		전하고 싶다고 말해줘요
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	The doppelganger is alive,
		도플갱어가 살아있으며
00:21:58	 
		- and she's ready to surrender. - What?!
		 
		포기할 준비가
		되어 있다고 / 뭐라고요?
00:22:00	 
		Oh, my God, I knew I recognized you.
		 
		세상에 낯이 익다 했더니
00:22:03	 
		Get him the message, please.
		 
		메세지 전해주세요
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:16	What are you doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:22:16	 
		I'm getting Klaus' attention.
		 
		클라우스의 주의를 끌려구요
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:19	If Klaus knows that you're alive,
		클라우스가 네가
		살아있단 걸 알게되면
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	he'll find you and he'll kill you.
		널 찾아서 죽일거야
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:26	Which is exactly what you wanted all along.
		여태껏 그걸 원했던거였군
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:28	It's either me or my family.
		나 아니면 가족이 다쳐요
00:22:30	 
		 
00:22:31	So this whole charade was a suicide mission
		이 모든 연기는
		자살임무를 위한 거였군
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:33	so that you could sacrifice yourself
		스스로 제물이 되어
00:22:35	 
		and save everyone else?
		 
		다른 사람들을 구하려고?
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:37	Cody is on his way.
		코디가 오고 있어요
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	And he really wants to meet you.
		정말 만나고 싶다네요
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:53	The youngest Gilbert.
		길버트가 막내군
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:55	This is an intriguing surprise.
		정말 흥미로운 깜짝선물인걸
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	I'm here for the moonstone.
		월장석 찾으러 왔어
00:22:58	 
		Yeah, yeah, the moonstone.
		 
		그렇지, 월장석
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:00	It's very popular today.
		요즘 인기가 많더군
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	Just give it to me.
		그냥 내놔
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:05	Leave, little Gilbert.
		가거라, 제레미
00:23:07	 
		 
00:23:08	If you want it, you're going to have to
		 come here and get it.
		원하면 와서 가져가봐
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:20	I kinda figured you'd say that.
		그럴 줄 알았어
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:30	Where is it?
		어디 있어?
00:23:31	 
		 
00:24:07	Sorry I'm late. I had to grab
		늦어서 미안
00:24:09	 
		the grimoire from home.
		 
		집에서 주술서를 가져오느라
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:10	Jeremy couldn't take the pressure, huh?
		제레미는 참기 힘들었나 본데?
00:24:12	 
		He said he'd be here.
		 
		올거랬는데
00:24:13	 
		 
00:24:16	Not a good time, Rose.
		지금 전화받기 힘든데
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:18	Don't be angry with me.
		화내지 마
00:24:19	 
		Why, what'd you do?
		 
		왜, 뭘 했길래?
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:21	You need to get to Richmond immediately.
		즉시 리치몬드로 가
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:23	Tell me.
		무슨 일이야
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:30	Is that the moonstone?!
		저거 월장석 아냐?
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:33	I hate to interrupt,
		방해하기 싫지만
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	but today has just been full of surprises.
		오늘 정말 깜짝선물 천지더군
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:39	I'm sorry.
		미안
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:40	I took some powder.
		잿가루를 좀 가져갔어
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:42	Don't worry.
		걱정 마
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	I know that he's wearing his ring,
		반지를 끼고 있으면
00:24:44	 
		So no matter how many times I kill him,
		 
		내가 몇 번을 죽이든 간에
00:24:46	 
		he'll just keep coming back for more.
		 
		계속 살아 돌아올테니
00:24:48	 
		So, I'm going to be in the back
		 
		그럼 난 가서
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:50	playing with my new little toy.
		내 인형하고 더 놀아야 겠네
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	You guys just give me a holler
		 when you've got the tomb open.
		무덤 열면
		날 불러줘
00:24:55	 
		 
00:25:02	So how exactly does this spell work?
		이 주문은 어떻게 통하지?
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:07	Give me your hand.
		손을 줘 보세요
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:19	Place it here.
		여기 놓으십시요
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:24	Now, take my hand.
		이제 내 손을 잡으세요
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:28	Close your eyes.
		눈을 감고
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:30	Relax your mind.
		마음을 푸세요
00:25:32	 
		 
00:25:33	And look for her.
		이제 그녀를 찾아보세요
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:57	You saw her, didn't you?
		그녀를 보셨군요?
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:00	I know exactly where she is.
		바로 어디 있는지 알겠어
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:11	Where the hell is Damon?
		데이먼은 대체 어디 있어?
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	We can't wait, we have to get him out of there.
		기다릴 시간 없어
		그냥 꺼내오자
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	If she's fed, she has her strength back.
		피를 마셨다면
		힘을 되찾았을 거야
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:17	We still have what's left of the ash.
		남은 잿가루가 좀 있어
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:20	Do you think you can get close enough?
		캐더린 가까이
		갈 수 있을 것 같아?
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:22	I don't have a choice.
		달리 방법이 없잖아
00:26:23	 
		It's going to take me some time.
		 
		시간이 좀 걸릴거야?
00:26:25	 
		- How long? - I don't know, a while.
		 
		- 얼마나?
		- 모르겠어, 좀
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:29	Just get me in there as soon as you can.
		최대한 빨리
		들어가게 해줘
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:35	So how was school?
		학교는 어땠냐?
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:38	Riveting.
		놀라웠죠
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:49	What's wrong?
		왜 그러니?
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:52	Nothing.
		아무 것도 아녜요
00:26:53	 
		 
00:27:16	September 15th--
		9월 15일
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	2 hours from the first full moon
		첫 보름달이 뜨기 2시간 전
00:27:20	 
		since I triggered the curse.
		첫 보름달이 뜨기 2시간 전
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:23	He taped his first transformation.
		첫 변이과정을 녹화해놨어
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:29	September 16th, he--
		9월 16일
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:31	He wrote about everything the next day.
		그 다음날 모든 걸 기록했네
00:27:33	 
		 
00:27:35	"I chose the garage.
		'난 차고를 택했다'
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	I could deadbolt the door.
		'문을 이중 자물쇠로 잠궈놓았다'
00:27:38	 
		It was far from the street so no one could hear.
		 
		'아무도 듣지 못하게
		거리와 멀리 떨어진 곳이었다'
00:27:40	 
		 
00:27:41	I bolted hooks to the floor for the carabineers."
		'바닥에 걸이를 고정시키고
		강철 고리(카라비너)를 연결했다'
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:44	Like for mountain climbing?
		카라비너라면
		등산용 말이지?
00:27:46	 
		 
00:27:47	Retractable cables.
		강철로 만든 고리
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:56	What's he doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:58	It's...Wolfsbane.
		투구꽃 (wolfsbane)
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	"I diluted wolfsbane with water to weaken myself,
		'내 힘을 약화시키려
		물에 투구꽃을 타서 마셨다'
00:28:03	 
		but I could barely get it down without puking.
		 
		'구토하지 않고는
		목에 넘기기 힘들었다'
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	It felt like I was drinking battery acid."
		'전지산을 마시는 기분이었다'
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:12	Hours passed and nothing happened.
		'몇 시간이 지났지만
		아무 일도 일어나지 않았다'
00:28:14	 
		 
00:28:15	It got so quiet, I could hear
		 my own blood pumping.
		'너무 조용해서 내 심장 뛰는
		소리가 들릴 정도였다'
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:19	That's when...
		'그 때 바로'
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:27	I kept thinking I'd black out and not feel it.
		'쓰러진 뒤 아무 감각이
		없어질 거라 생각했다'
00:28:29	 
		But I did. I...
		 
		'하지만 느껴졌다'
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:32	I felt all of it.
		'모든 감각이 느껴졌다'
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:37	Help! Has somebody...
		도와줘요!
		누구 없어요?
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:42	How long is it?
		얼마나 계속 돼?
00:28:43	 
		We're 3 hours in.
		 
		지금까지 3시간 봤어
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:46	4 hours.
		4시간
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:48	5 hours.
		5시간
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:50	How long does this last?
		언제 끝나지?
00:28:51	 
		 
00:29:07	I can't-- I can't do that.
		난.. 저렇게 못 하겠어
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:10	Caroline, whatever that was,
		캐롤라인, 저게 뭐였든
00:29:12	 
		 
00:29:12	I can't go through that.
		난 저런 걸 겪어낼 수 없다구
00:29:14	 
		 
00:29:23	- What are you doing here?
		 - What are you doing here?
		- 여긴 왠 일이죠?
		- 너야말로 왜 온거야?
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:28	You called him?
		전화했어요?
00:29:29	 
		I'm sorry, Elena.
		 
		미안, 엘레나
00:29:30	 
		 
00:29:30	- You said that you understood. - She lied.
		- 날 이해한다면서요
		- 거짓말 한거야
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:35	Damon Salvatore.
		데이먼 살바토어잖아
00:29:36	 
		Get rid of her.
		 
		딴데로 데려가
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:38	No...way.
		말도 안돼
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:42	Come on. We're leaving.
		어서 가자
00:29:43	 
		- No. - I said we're leaving.
		 
		- 싫어요
		- 가자고 했지
00:29:45	 
		I'm not going with you.
		 
		난 당신하고는 안 가요
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:46	You do not get to make decisions anymore.
		이제 더이상
		넌 선택권이 없어
00:29:49	 
		When have I ever made a decision?
		 
		내가 선택을 한 적이
		언제 있었다구요?
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	You and Stefan do that for me.
		늘 당신과 스테판이
		나 대신 결정을 해줬죠
00:29:52	 
		Now this, this is my decision.
		 
		이젠 내가 결정해요
00:29:54	 
		 
00:29:55	Who's going to save your life while
		네가 결정을 내리면
		누가 네 목숨을 구해주지?
00:29:56	 
		you're making decisions?
		네가 결정을 내리면
		누가 네 목숨을 구해주지?
00:29:57	 
		you're making decisions?
		 
00:29:57	 
		You're not listening to me, Damon.
		내 말을 안 듣는군요
00:29:58	 
		I don't want to be saved.
		 
		누가 날 구하는 건
		원치 않는다구요
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:01	Not if it means
		만약에
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:03	that Klaus is going to kill every 
		single person that I love.
		클라우스가 내가 사랑하는
		모든 이를 죽일 계획이라면요
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:07	Get your ass out the door before
		 I throw you over my shoulder
		당장 이 문을 나가지 않으면
		널 내 어깨 위로 올려서
00:30:09	 
		and carry you out myself.
		 
		직접 들고 나갈 줄 알아
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:12	No.
		싫어요
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:23	Don't ever do that again.
		다시는 그러지 마라
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:35	Something's happening.
		뭔가 일이 터졌네
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:38	Bonnie, no!
		보니, 안돼!
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:41	You have to stop her, she's not strong enough!
		멈춰야 해요
		아직 약하다구요!
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:45	Maybe she is.
		어쩌면
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:51	What's going on?
		무슨 일이야?
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:54	It's Bonnie Bennett.
		보니 베넷이에요
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	She's channeling me.
		저하고 힘을 통하고 있어요
00:30:56	 
		Why would you let her do that?
		 
		왜 그렇게 하게 둔 거냐?
00:30:57	 
		You told me to bond with her, so I bonded.
		 
		친해지라고 하셔서
		친해졌다구요
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:02	My God.
		세상에
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:04	Bonnie, Bonnie.
		보니, 보니
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:06	Bonnie... You gotta stop her!
		멈춰야 해요!
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:11	Ok, you need to stop. Bonnie!
		그만해, 보니!
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:15	Luka!
		루카!
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:24	Bonnie!
		보니!
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:29	Bonnie!
		보니!
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:31	Bonnie, wake up, please.
		보니, 일어나, 제발
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:33	- Bonnie, wake up. -Yes, please.
		- 보니, 일어나
		- 그래. 제발
00:31:35	 
		Because I'm still in here.
		 
		난 아직도 여기 있거든
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:37	Are you OK? Here.
		괜찮니?
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Are you all right?
		괜찮아?
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:41	It didn't work.
		효과가 없었어
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:43	I'm not strong enough.
		난 충분히 강하지 않아
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:45	Even with help, I can't do it.
		도움을 받아도
		할 수가 없어
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	Ohh, that's too bad. I'm still hungry.
		그 것 참 안됐네
		나 아직 배고픈데
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:53	Go!
		가!
00:31:54	 
		 
00:32:04	You know what,
		있지
00:32:05	 
		 
00:32:05	I don't think we should read this anymore.
		이건 그만 읽자
00:32:07	 
		Why, what did you read?
		 
		왜, 뭘 읽었길래?
00:32:08	 
		 
00:32:09	There's a...
		그게..
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:11	a reason it's called a "curse", Tyler.
		저주라 불리는 건
		이유가 있어서야, 타일러
00:32:14	 
		"Unimaginable pain."
		 
		'상상할 수 없는 고통'
00:32:15	 
		 
00:32:16	"I thought it would never end."
		'영원히 끝나지 않을 것 같았다'
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:18	"It was the worst night of my life."
		'내 인생 최악의 밤이었다'
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:24	But...
		하지만..
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	he did say that the transformation
		메이슨이 적기로는
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:27	speeds up over time.
		변이과정은 시간이 지나면서
		점점 짧아진대
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	So if you can just get through
		그러니까 네가 첫 변이를
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	this first time, then--
		잘 넘기기만 하면..
00:32:33	 
		Why are you helping me?
		 
		왜 날 돕는 거야?
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:37	- What do you mean? -Why do you care?
		- 무슨 말이야?
		- 왜 신경 쓰는건데?
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:40	We've never been friends before.
		우린 전에 친구사이도 아녔잖아
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:42	That's not true. I've known you my entire life, Tyler.
		그건 사실이 아냐
		널 평생을 알고 지냈다구
00:32:45	 
		We've never been close.
		 
		우린 친한 적 없었잖아
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:48	Not like this.
		이런 식으로
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:51	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:52	You just seem like you...
		넌 나와 같아 보여서..
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:55	like you kinda need it.
		필요한 것 같았어
00:32:56	 
		 
00:33:07	I was alone when I turned.
		나도 변했을 때
		혼자였어
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:11	I had no control over my body
		내 신체를
		통제할 수 없었지
00:33:13	 
		or...my urges.
		 
		내 욕구를
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:17	And...
		그리고..
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:22	I killed somebody.
		사람을 죽였어
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:27	I don't want that to happen to you.
		너한테도 그런 일이
		생기길 원치 않아
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:33	I don't want you to be alone.
		네가 혼자 되길 원치 않아
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:45	I gotta...
		나..
00:33:46	 
		 
00:33:58	Matt...
		맷..
00:33:59	 
		 
00:33:59	I know I should have called. I'm sorry.
		전화할 걸 그랬어, 미안해
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	What are you doing here?
		무슨 일이야?
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:34:04	 
		But I was driving home from work,
		 
		일 끝나고 집으로 운전하다가
00:34:06	 
		and I just--I kinda found myself here.
		 
		네 집에 와 있더라
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:09	Well, are you OK?
		괜찮아?
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:11	I--I've been worried about you.
		네가 많이.. 걱정 됐어
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:14	I miss you.
		네가 그리워
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:24	Yeah.
		그래
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:28	Matt, I...
		맷, 나..
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:33	Hey.
		안녕
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:35	Hey.
		안녕
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:40	Time to go.
		갈 시간이야
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	Alice is soundly sleeping,
		앨리스는 깊이 자고 있으니
00:34:42	 
		and won't remember a moment
		 
		이렇게 끔찍히 바보같은 날을
		한 순간도 기억하지 않을거야
00:34:44	 
		of this horribly stupid day.
		 
		이렇게 끔찍히 바보같은 날을
		한 순간도 기억하지 않을거야
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:48	We're here to meet the doppelganger.
		도플갱어를 만나서 왔다
00:34:50	 
		Thank you for coming.
		 
		와줘서 고마워요
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	I will break your arm.
		팔 부러지는 줄 알아
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:56	There's nothing here for you.
		도플갱어는 여기 없어요
00:34:57	 
		 
00:35:09	I killed you. You were dead.
		내가 당신을 죽였는데
		당신은 죽었다고
00:35:11	 
		For centuries now.
		 
		죽은지 몇 세기 됐지
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	- Who are you? - Who are you?
		- 자넨 뭐지?
		- 당신은?
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	I'm Elijah.
		일라이자네
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:18	We were going to bring her to you.
		당신에게 전달하려고 왔습니다
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:20	For Klaus. She's the doppelganger.
		클라우스씨가 시켰어요
		저 여자가 바로 도플갱어에요
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:24	I don't know how she exists, but she does.
		어떻게 존재하는지 모르지만
		살아있군요
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:26	Klaus would want to see her.
		클라우스씨가 당신을
		뵙고 싶어합니다
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	Does anyone else know that you're here?
		자네가 여기 온 걸
		아는 다른 사람이 있나?
00:35:30	 
		No.
		 
		없습니다
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:32	Well, then, you have been incredibly helpful.
		그럼, 도움 정말 고마웠네
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:58	Where's Luka?
		루카는 어디 있나?
00:35:59	 
		 
00:36:01	Asleep.
		자고 있습니다
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:03	His shadow spell was successful.
		그림자 주문은 성공적이었어
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:06	I was able to track that girl.
		그 여자를 추적할 수 있었거든
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:10	However, I did have a little run in
		하지만 나는 날 죽인
		형제들과 마주쳤지
00:36:11	 
		with one of the brothers that killed me.
		하지만 나는 날 죽인
		형제들과 마주쳤지
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:16	I assume he didn't live to tell about it.
		누설하기 전에
		죽였겠군요
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	Actually, I spared him.
		사실은 자비를 베풀었지
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:21	He'd die before he'd let anything happen to her.
		그녀를 위해서라면
		목숨을 바칠 녀석이야
00:36:23	 
		They both would.
		 
		둘 다 말이지
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:27	She'll be kept safe.
		엘레나는 계속 안전하게
		보호받을 거야
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:30	For now.
		이젠 달라지겠죠
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	Well, that's precisely what we need her to be.
		사실은 엘레나가
		그렇게 보호받길 원해
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:38	Safe.
		안전히 말이네
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:49	I'm home, ok?
		다 왔어
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:54	I don't need an escort to my room.
		방까지 데려다줄
		필요 없다고
00:36:55	 
		Oh, I don't know.
		 
		모르겠어
00:36:56	 
		Between here and upstairs,
		 
		여기서 계단까지
00:36:57	 
		there's still time for you to do
		 something stupid.
		 
		바보같은 짓을 저지를
		시간은 충분하니까
00:36:59	 
		 
00:37:00	I already feel bad.
		 I don't need you to berate me.
		이미 기분 안 좋은데
		꾸짖지 말아줘
00:37:03	 
		Stefan is stuck in there,
		 
		스테판은 거기 갇혀있고
00:37:04	 
		and I don't know how to get him out.
		 
		난 꺼낼 방법을 몰라
00:37:06	 
		What should I be doing?
		 
		어떻게 할까?
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:08	You should admit that you never should have
		애초에 이런 걸 시도하지
		않았어야 했지
00:37:09	 
		tried this in the first place.
		애초에 이런 걸 시도하지
		않았어야 했지
00:37:10	 
		I didn't have a choice, Jeremy!
		 
		달리 방법이 없었다구!
00:37:12	 
		Yeah, well, neither did I.
		 
		나도 마찬가지야
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:16	Why did you have to get involved?
		왜 이 일에 휘말리려는 건데?
00:37:18	 
		'cause I didn't want you to get hurt.
		 
		누나가 다치는건
		원치 않으니까
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:23	Look, Jeremy,
		제레미
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:27	you can't feel that way about me.
		날 그런 식으로
		생각해선 안 돼
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:31	Don't.
		그러지 마
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:34	What?
		뭐?
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:36	Don't act like this is one-sided. Like...
		일방적인 것 처럼
		연기하지 말라고
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	Like I'm some kid
		날 무슨
00:37:41	 
		that has a crush on his sister's friend.
		 
		누나 친구를 짝사랑하는 애처럼 말야
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:45	You could have died today.
		오늘 죽을 수도 있었어
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:51	And you almost did.
		너도 죽을 뻔 했잖아
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:54	That was a chance I was willing to take.
		그런 기회는 기꺼이 감수할거야
00:37:56	 
		 
00:37:58	I can't.
		안돼
00:37:59	 
		 
00:38:01	I can't.
		안 돼겠어
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:04	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:38:06	 
		 
00:38:07	Yeah.
		그래
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:23	thank you for bringing me home.
		집에 데려다줘서 고마워요
00:38:24	 
		Well, your ride left you.
		 
		로즈가 가버렸으니
00:38:25	 
		Didn't want to leave you stranded.
		 
		널 두고 갈 수 없었어
00:38:27	 
		 
00:38:28	She was just scared. She didn't mean to run.
		그냥 겁을 먹은 것 뿐예요
		도망칠 의도는 아녔어요
00:38:31	 
		Yes, she did.
		 
		그렇지
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	She's been running for 500 years.
		500년을 도망 다녔어
00:38:34	 
		I can't believe Elijah's alive.
		 
		일라이자가 살아 있다니
00:38:35	 
		Why do you think he killed 
		those 2 vampires and just let us go?
		 
		그 두 뱀파이어를 죽이면성
		우리는 그냥 보낸 이유가 뭘까요?
00:38:39	 
		If I had a dollar for every time
		 
		매번 사악한 뱀파이어들이
		내 뒤통수를 치더군
00:38:40	 
		some evil vampire surprised me.
		 
		매번 사악한 뱀파이어들이
		내 뒤통수를 치더군
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:47	What you did today was incredibly stupid.
		네가 오늘 한 짓은
		엄청나게 바보같았어
00:38:50	 
		Actually, the only thing was stupid
		 was that I got caught.
		 
		사실, 제가 들킨게
		제일 바보같은 일이었어요
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:54	I don't question why you and Stefan, 
		everyone else
		당신과 스테판이나 다들 날
		구하려 노력하는 이유를 묻지 않죠
00:38:57	 
		tries so hard to save me.
		당신과 스테판이나 다들 날
		구하려 노력하는 이유를 묻지 않죠
00:38:59	 
		You shouldn't question why
		 I would try to save all of you.
		 
		그러니까 내가 모든 이들을
		구하려는 이유도 묻지 마세요
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:03	Damon, good night, ok?
		데이먼, 잘 자요
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	What?
		뭐?
00:39:07	 
		It's Stefan.
		 
		스테판 일이야
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:10	Stefan.
		스테판
00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:13	Stefan!
		스테판!
00:39:14	 
		 
00:39:16	Don't you dare.
		감히
00:39:17	 
		Stefan's in there, damon!
		 
		스테판이 저기 갇혔다구요!
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	How could you let this happen?
		어떻게 이렇게 되게 둔거죠?
00:39:19	 
		What are you talking about?
		 I was too busy saving you
		 
		무슨 소리야? 네 무모한 임무로부터
		널 구하느라 바빴다구
00:39:21	 
		from your crazy kamikaze mission.
		 
		무슨 소리야? 네 무모한 임무로부터
		널 구하느라 바빴다구
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	You didn't even have to go after
		 the moonstone in the first place.
		애초에 월장석을
		쫓을 필요 없었잖아요
00:39:26	 
		It was the right call.
		 
		옳은 결정이었어
00:39:27	 
		The right call? How is any of this the right call?
		 
		옳은 결정이요?
		어찌 이런게 옳은 결정이죠?
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:31	Damon, let go of me.
		데이먼, 놔줘요
00:39:32	 
		Damon, let go of me!
		 
		놔달라구요!
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:34	Let go of me!
		비켜요!
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:37	Let go of me.
		놔달란 말예요!
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:39	Please.
		제발
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:43	Are you done?
		끝났니?
00:39:44	 
		 
00:40:03	Off all the idiot plans, Stefan.
		바보같은 계획 중에서
		그걸 택했니
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:08	I'll find a way to get you out.
		꺼낼 방법을 찾아낼게
00:40:09	 
		 
00:40:09	No, that's all right.
		아니, 괜찮아
00:40:10	 
		I'll--I'll handle it myself.
		 
		내가.. 처리할게
00:40:12	 
		 
00:40:13	Bonnie has the moonstone.
		보니한테 월장석이 있어
00:40:15	 
		 
00:40:15	Work with her, try to figure out
		 how to de-spell it.
		보니와 협력해서
		주문을 풀 방법을 찾아봐
00:40:17	 
		You martyr yourself into a tomb
		 
		넌 무덤 안에서
		스스로 수난을 당하고
00:40:18	 
		and I get partnered with
		 a semi-competent witch.
		 
		난 아직 부족한 마녀와 협력을 하라
00:40:21	 
		 
00:40:21	Wonderful.
		잘됐네
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:24	- Keep Elena away from here. - Yeah.
		엘레나는 못 오게 막아줘 / 그래
00:40:26	 
		'cause that'll be easy.
		 
		쉽지 않을텐데
00:40:27	 
		 
00:40:27	Promise me.
		약속해줘
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:29	No matter what happens.
		무슨 일이 생기든
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:31	You'll protect her.
		엘레나를 지켜줄 거라고
00:40:33	 
		 
00:40:36	Promise.
		약속하마
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:45	That right there was the biggest
		 mistake you've ever made.
		방금 그건 네 평생 
		최고의 실수가 될거야
00:40:49
