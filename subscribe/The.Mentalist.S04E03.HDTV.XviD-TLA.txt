00:00:05	You all set for tomorrow?
		내일 일 준비 다 됐어?
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	12 o'clock sharp,
		we're ready.
		12시 정각에 시작하면 돼요 
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	You're talking about lunch?
		That sounds civilized.
		지금 점심 얘기하는거야? 새삼스럽게 
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	You got the memo.
		공지 들었잖아 
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	We're talking about the mandatory
		seminar on budget protocols.
		예산 규정에 관한 세미나 참석 필수라고
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	- Oh, have fun with that.
		- You're coming too, Jane.
		- 아, 재밌게 다녀와
		- 너도 오는거야, 제인 
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	You're joking, of course.
		I don't do seminars.
		농담이시겠지 난 세미나 같은거 안 가
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	- Oh, you do when they're mandatory.
		- No, I'm a consultant.
		- 필참일땐 와야지 
		- 난 자문위원이잖아
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	Too bad.
		못됐다
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	They're checking attendance.
		You have to sign in.
		출석 체크하니까 너 가서 싸인해야 돼 
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	Oh. Okay then. Um...
		아, 그렇다면야
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	"Patrick Jane."
		"패트릭 제인"
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	Just, uh, copy that down
		for me.
		가서 내 대신 베껴줘
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	Forge your signature?
		That's against the rules.
		서명을 위조하라고? 규정 위반이야
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	Is it?
		I'm not gonna tell anyone.
		그래? 아무한테도 말 안할게 
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	- Jane.
		- Lisbon.
		- 제인
		- 리스본
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	I understand
		your precarious emotional state,
		갓 복직된 입장에서 
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	given you've just gotten
		your job back,
		그것도 네 일거수 일투족을 감시하는 
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	and your sensitivity
		to the bureaucrats that
		이 관료체제에 대해 
00:00:48	 
		 
00:00:48	are watching your every move.
		네가 민감할 수 밖에 없는 심정은 이해하는데 
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	- They are.
		- Yes, but that's your thing.
		- 정말 감시하거든 
		- 그거야 네 사정이고 
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:51	I gotta be me.
		I can't change who I am.
		난 나 좋은대로 살아야겠어 이렇게 생겨먹은걸 어떻게 바꿔
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	No, but you can change
		where you are tomorrow at 12:00.
		내일 12시엔 바꾸시게 될거야
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	It's not gonna happen.
		안 바꿀 건데용 
00:00:58	 
		 
00:00:58	You think this is funny?
		이게 재밌어 보이니?
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	We got a missing child--
		Marin County.
		마린 카운티에서 아동 실종신고입니다
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:01	Snatched from a school bus stop
		two hours ago.
		2시간 전 버스 정류장에서 납치됐답니다
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:03	The mother asked for us
		specifically.
		아이 어머니가 특별히 저희한테 사건을 꽃았습니다
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:05	Rigsby is gonna meet us downstairs.
		릭스비는 아래서 기다리고 있습니다
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	Van Pelt,
		set up a command post here.
		여기 있어, 나가서 연락할게 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	Liaise with the marin sheriff.
		Tell him we're on our way.
		마린 카운티 보안관에 연락해서 우리가 지금 간다 그래 
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:13	It's good to have her back.
		돌아오니까 좋죠
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	Mm. Yes, it is.
		그러게
00:01:18	 
		 
00:01:25	Our missing boy--
		9 years old, only child.
		실종된 애는 9살이고 외동이군
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	Another kid was walking
		to the bus stop,
		정류장으로 향하던 다른 아이가 말하길
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:29	and he saw a vehicle
		peeling out
		실종된 코너 플린트가 탄 차량이 
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	with our boy Conner Flint
		in it.
		휙 지나가는 걸 봤대 
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	The man behind the wheel was
		wearing a hoodie.
		운전석에 앉은 남자는 후드티를 입었다는군 
00:01:36	 
		 
00:01:36	Description on the vehicle?
		어떻게 생긴 차량인데요?
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	Big and dark.
		The kid's only 8 years old.
		크고 검었대 본 애도 8살이야
00:01:41	 
		 
00:01:41	Could it be
		a custody kidnapping?
		친부 소행일순 없나요?
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	The woman was widowed
		two years ago.
		여자는 2년전 사별했어 
00:01:44	 
		 
00:01:44	Her husband died of cancer.
		남자는 암으로 죽었대
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:46	Looks like
		there's family money,
		가족 재산이 상당한 듯 한데 
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:47	but there's
		no ransom demand yet.
		몸값 요구는 현재까지 없는 상황이야
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:50	Start with the bus stop?
		정류장부터 시작할까요?
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:51	Yeah, you and Cho.
		조랑 둘이 가
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	Jane and I will question
		the family.
		난 제인이랑 가족 보러 갈테니까
00:01:55	 
		 
00:02:01	What's the mother's name?
		애 엄마 이름이 뭐라고?
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	Elizabeth Flint.
		엘리자베스 플린트 
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:27	Patrick!
		Ohh. Thank God you're here.
		패트릭! 당신이 여기 있다니, 하느님 감사합니다.. 
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	Hello, Beth.
		안녕, 베스
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:36	I have everything ready
		for the reading.
		당신 위한 모든 준비는 다 했어요
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	I'm gonna do everything I can
		to help, Beth, I promise,
		내가 도울 수 있는 일이라면 뭐든지 할게요, 약속해요
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:41	but, uh, I need to you know,
		I'm--I'm not a psychic anymore.
		하지만 내가 더 이상 영매가 아니라는 걸 말해야겠네요
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:45	What? Wh-what do you mean?
		무슨 말이에요?
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	Well, I mean, I'm not...
		그러니까 내 말은.. 난 영매가.. 
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	Well, I-I never really was
		a psychic.
		아니, 난 한번도 영매였던 적이 없어요
00:02:52	 
		 
00:02:52	No, I'm not--wh--
		아니에요, 난.. 
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:53	no, what are you--
		what are you saying?
		아니, 지금 무슨 말씀 하시는 거예요?
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54	No, I-I know
		that--that you--you are.
		영매잖아요 
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	Look, you...
		저기.. 
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	Please.
		Please help me find Connor.
		부탁이니 코너 좀 찾아주세요
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	You--you have a connection
		with him...
		코너를 느낄 수 있잖아요
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	- Beth.
		- So let's--
		- 베스
		- 그러니까.. 
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	can we get started?
		Um, I have this locket,
		시작해도 되죠? 여기 로켓도 있어요
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	- and it--it has his picture in it.
		- Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry.
		- 안에 사진도 있구요
		- 죄송합니다만 부인, 
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	- Patrick, I'm so happy you're here.
		- Ma'am.
		- 패트릭, 당신이 여기 있어 얼마나 다행인지.. 
		- 부인
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	- Would you excuse u for a moment?
		- I'm glad you're here.
		- 잠시만 실례해도 되겠습니까?
		- 당신이 여기 있어 천만다행이에요
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	I-I'm sorry.
		죄송합니다
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:25	She's an old client.
		옛 고객이구나
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	Uh, yeah.
		그래
00:03:28	 
		 
00:03:28	This is a mess
		we don't have time for.
		이런 걸로 낭비할 시간 없어
00:03:30	 
		 
00:03:30	That boy is out there
		somewhere,
		지금도 애가 저 밖 어딘가 있어
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:32	and this psychic stuff is
		a distraction.
		영매니 뭐니 시간만 잡아먹을 뿐이야
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	I think you'd better leave.
		넌 그냥 가는게 좋겠다
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	Can't say I disagree.
		아니라고만도 할 수 없는 상황이군 
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	Hello. Is Beth inside?
		베스 안에 있나요?
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	And you are...
		그러는 그쪽은.. 
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:45	I'm agent Lisbon.
		We're with the CBI.
		CBI의 리스본 요원입니다
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	Oh.
		아
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:48	Nathan Glass.
		네이던 글라스 입니다
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	When Beth called me
		and told me about Connor,
		베스가 전화해 코너 얘기를 했을때 
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	I came over right away
		to see what I could sense.
		절 괴롭히던 예감의 이유를 깨달았죠
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:53	Sense?
		예감이요?
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	I'm Beth's spiritual advisor.
		전 베스의 영적 조언자랍니다
00:03:55	 
		 
00:03:55	A psychic?
		영매요?
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	Yeah. She's expecting me.
		Excuse me.
		죄송하지만 안에서 기다릴거라서
00:03:59	 
		 
00:04:04	Second thought...
		생각이 바뀌었어

00:04:47	Forensics found the kid's phone
		in the bushes over there.
		검시관이 저쪽 수풀에서 애 휴대폰을 찾았어 
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:51	Has the amber alert
		gone live?
		황색경보(아동 납치경보) 발령했나?
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:53	Yep. No tips yet.
		아직 그것까진 아니고 
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:55	Deputies shut down
		the surrounding streets
		지역 보안관이 코너가 없어지고 
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	right after Connor
		went missing.
		그 즉시 주변 도로를 폐쇄했대 
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	There's some unpaved trails
		in the woods
		숲속으로 차량이 통과할 수 있는 
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:58	that maybe a vehicle
		could get through.
		비포장길이 있는 것 같아 
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	We got checkpoints up,
		but...
		검문소도 체크해봤지만 아직.. 
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:06	Hey, Van Pelt,
		we get a ransom demand yet?
		반펠트, 몸값 요구는 아직이야?
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	No, and I don't think
		we're going to.
		없는데 앞으로 있을 것 같지도 않아요
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	There have been
		two other abductions
		비슷한 수법으로 해변 지역에서 
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	in the bay area
		with a similar M.O.--
		두건이 더 있었어요
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:13	young boys snatched
		while waiting for the bus--
		버스를 기다리던 소년들이 납치당했죠
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	but there were balloon animals
		found at those scenes,
		그땐 현장에서 풍선이 발견됐는데 
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	and they think that's how
		the guy lured the kids.
		그걸로 피해자들을 꼬여냈다고 보고 있어요
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	What happened to those boys?
		피해자들은 어떻게 됐지? 
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	ME estimates both boys
		were strangled
		검시관 의견으로는 실종되고 
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	approximately 12 hours
		after they vanished.
		약 12시간 후 교살되었다고 해요
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:29	Which means Connor has
		only about eight hours.
		코너에게는 약 여덟시간이 있다는 뜻이군 
00:05:32	 
		 
00:05:39	I talked with Connor
		about safety all the time.
		코너에겐 항상 안전을 당부했어요
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	You know,
		i-if a stranger grabs you,
		낯선 사람이 데려가려고 하면 
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	just kick, punch, scream,
		anything to get away.
		차고 때리고 고함질러 어떻게든 벗어나라고
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	You know, I-I...
		I told him.
		늘 당부했어요
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	Shh. It's not your fault.
		You taught him well.
		당신 잘못이 아니에요 당신은 잘 가르쳤어요
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	Everyone who knows you
		knows that you're a perfect mom.
		당신을 아는 누구나 당신을 최고의 엄마라고 할 거예요
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	How well did you know Connor?
		코너는 어떻게 알고 계시죠?
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	Beth and I have been working
		together for two years,
		베스와 저는 2년간 같이 일했어요
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	since her husband passed over.
		바깥분이 돌아가시고 난 다음부터죠
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	I feel like
		I've watched him grow up.
		코너가 자라는걸 쭉 지켜봤어요
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	Connor's such a great kid.
		He's kind and funny and smart.
		상냥하고 유쾌하면서 똑똑한 아이였어요
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	Beth, uh, did Connor always
		take the bus to school?
		베스, 코너는 늘 버스로 등교하나요?
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	It--it was Deke's idea--
		uh, my brother.
		그건 덱, 제 남동생 생각이었어요
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	Um, he thought
		it would do Connor good.
		코너한테 좋을거라 했지요
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	Deke Hutton. He lives here.
		덱 휴턴 같이 살아요
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	Um, yes, ever since James died,
		제임스 죽고난 뒤부터요
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	and--and I-I agreed
		with him about the bus.
		저도 덱 말이 옳다고 생각했어요
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	You know, I-I didn't want
		Connor to grow up sheltered,
		코너를 과보호 상태로 기르고 싶지 않았어요
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	and Jonathan supported it, too.
		조나단도 찬성했구요
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	Jonathan is
		my, um, my grown stepson.
		조나단은 제 의붓아들이에요
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	He's, um, Connor's brother.
		코너에겐 형이죠
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	You know, he--
		actually, he owns this house.
		사실 여기는 조나단의 집이에요
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	He's letting Connor and me
		stay as long as we want.
		저와 코너가 얼마든지 머물러도 좋다고 했죠
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	Nice guy.
		좋은 사람이네요
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:47	And where are
		Deke and Jonathan now?
		덱과 조나단은 지금 어디 있죠?
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	Um, they're
		with our--our bankers.
		은행에요
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:53	If--
		만약.. 
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	if this is, uh,
		a-a ransom-type thing, I--
		만약 이게 몸값이나 그런 걸 노린거라면
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	we would need to have
		a lot of cash.
		현금이 아주 많이 필요할 테니까요
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	Yes, @@/if@@\ it is.
		만약 그렇다면 그렇겠죠
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	You--
		저기.. 
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	you--you-- you can find him.
		우리 아이 찾을 수 있죠
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	You--you and Nate,
		you can work together.
		당신이랑 네이던 둘이서 함께 찾으면.. 
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	I know that you can--
		당신 할 수 있잖아요
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:10	I know you can see
		where he is, so...
		지금 우리 애 어딨는지 볼 수 있잖아요
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	So--so that
		we--we can bring him home.
		그래서 우리 애 좀 데려와 주세요.. 
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	Mr. Glass,
		would you excuse us?
		글라스씨, 잠시 비켜주시겠어요?
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	Beth, don't worry.
		I'll be outside, okay?
		베스, 바로 밖에 있을게요 걱정 말아요
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	Okay.
		 
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:23	Beth, please have a seat.
		베스, 일단 앉아보세요
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:27	Okay.
		Just breathe and relax.
		심호흡하고 긴장 풀어요
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	I need you to hear this, okay?
		그리고 내 말 잘 들어요
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	I'm not a psychic.
		나는 영매가 아니에요
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	I never was.
		그런 적도 없어요
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	I was a con artist.
		나는 사기꾼이었습니다
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	I took your money,
		and I told you lies.
		당신 돈을 갈취하고 거짓말을 한 겁니다
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	No, they--they weren't lies.
		거짓말 아니었어요
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	Yes.
		그랬어요
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	No. No. You--
		you know they weren't.
		아니란 거 알잖아요
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:46	No, i-if you're--
		if you're not a psychic,
		당신이 정말 영매가 아니라면
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	then--then why are you
		working with the police?
		왜 경찰에서 일해요?
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	Ma'am, Mr. Jane is working
		with us
		제인씨가 저희와 함께 일하는 이유는 
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	because he is
		an excellent investigator.
		제인씨가 훌륭한 수사관이기 때문입니다
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	He is gonna be
		very helpful in this.
		이번 사건에도 큰 도움이 될 겁니다 
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	I promise.
		보장합니다
00:07:59	 
		 
00:08:00	I understand.
		알겠어요
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	I-it must be a terrible burden--
		the gift you have.
		당신 재능.. 분명히 버겁겠지요
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	Of course you have to deny it.
		부인하려는 것도 무리는 아니에요
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	I mean...
		내 말은.. 
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	Even St. Peter denied
		who he was three times.
		베드로 성인도 세번 부인했다잖아요
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	Beth, there are
		no such thing as psychics.
		베스, 세상에 영매란건 없어요
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	- This man Glass...
		- It must be awful...
		- 글라스란 저 남자도.. 
		- 끔찍할 거예요.. 맞아요
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	- He's a fraud, too.
		- Knowing what's gonna happen.
		- 그 사람도 사기치는 겁니다
		- 나도 다 이해해요
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	I mean, if--who's gonna live
		and who's gonna die,
		누가 살지, 죽을지 보인다는 건 참.. 
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	but please, please...
		하지만 부탁이니, 제발, 
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	@@/Please@@\ don't deny your gift.
		제발 하늘로부터 받은 당신 능력을 부인하지 마세요
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	Not now. No. You have--
		you have to help me.
		적어도 지금은요 절 도와주셔야 해요
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	You have to help me
		find Connor.
		우리 애 좀 찾아주세요
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	Here, look.
		I have this locket,
		여기 로켓이 있다니까요
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	and it has his--
		his first haircut.
		처음 자른 애 머리카락도 있어요
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	Look at this. Touch this.
		See if you can get a sense.
		보고 만져보세요, 느낌이 오나 보시라구요
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	- If this is from his--
		- No, Beth.
		- 애한테서 나온 물건이니.. 
		- 안돼요, 베스
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	This is from
		his first haircut...
		처음 자른 머리카락이라구요
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	And... touch this.
		만져만 보세요
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	No.
		안돼요
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	- Mrs. Flint.
		- Please--no! My--no!
		- 플린트 부인 
		- 제발, 이러지 마요! 진짜!
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	My son--no! My son is missing.
		My son is missing!

00:08:50

		동생을 마지막으로 본 건 언제죠?
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	Uh, this morning
		at breakfast.
		오늘 아침 먹을때요
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	We like to have breakfast

		아침은 항상 같이 먹거든요
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	Beth, Connor, Deke,
		and me.
		베스, 코너, 덱, 저까지요
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	Connor had--had French toast.
		Everything was fine.
		코너는 프렌치 토스트를 먹었어요 여느 날과 똑같았는데 
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	I-I... I can't believe this.
		지금 일을 믿을 수가 없어요
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	How's--how's Beth doing?
		베스는 좀 어때요?
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	Mm. Not great.
		썩 좋진 않네요
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	How long ago did she marry
		your father?
		베스가 아버님과 결혼한건 언제죠?
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Um, 12 years ago.
		12년 전이요
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	How did you feel about that?
		어떻게 생각했나요?
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	I like and respect Beth,
		전 베스를 존경하고 따랐어요
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	if that's what you're
		getting at.
		질문이 의미하시는 바가 뭔진 모르겠지만요
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	She's no wicked stepmother.
		사악한 계모 같은게 아니었어요
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:40	I care deeply for her
		and Connor.
		전 베스와 코너를 깊이 아끼고 있어요
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:42	Well, if you care so much,
		how come you let her
		그렇게나 아낀다면 왜 대체 베스가 
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	throw her money away
		on this, uh, psychic?
		영매 따위에 돈을 쓰게 놔두는 겁니까?
00:10:46

00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	Yeah. Sorry.
		죄송합니다
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	We're trying to put together
		Connor's morning.
		아침 시간을 재구성해보죠
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	From what we understand,
		you dropped him off
		저희가 알기론 
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	at his school bus stop, right?
		코너를 버스 정류장에 내려주셨죠?
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	Yeah.
		네 
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	And you left him
		there alone?
		혼자 놔두셨구요?
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	Yeah.
		네 
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	He wanted it that way.
		그래달라 했습니다
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	He wanted to show
		his independence.
		혼자서도 문제없다는 걸 보이고 싶어했어요
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	The other kids on the bus
		would make fun of him
		정류장에서 어른이 기다려주면 
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	if he had somebody
		waiting with him.
		버스에서 아이들이 놀릴 거랬습니다
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	It's such a safe neighborhood.
		He's always been fine.
		주변 치안도 좋아서 여태 아무 문제 없었어요
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	So it was routine for you
		그러니까 항상 아이를 
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	to, uh, leave him
		alone there?
		그곳에 혼자 놔두셨단 거죠?
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	Yeah. I told you.
		He wanted it that way.
		애가 그래달라 했다니까요
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:39	Beth agreed.
		베스도 좋다고 했구요
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	If you think you're gonna pin
		this on me,
		지금 나한테 뒤집어 씌울 생각이라면
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	then you are
		very much mistaken!
		아주 크게 실수하시는 거요!

00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	Uh, yes, you are.
		You both are.
		아니, 그러세요 실은 두분 다 그래요
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	You--gambling,
		그쪽은 도박이군요
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	hence the purple smudge

00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	and your need to live off
		your sister's money,
		누나한테 업혀 사는 입장 아닙니까 
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	and you--antidepressants--

		그쪽은 항우울제 복용중이죠 핏기가 없고 이유없는 소화불량이 있겠고 
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	Some deep emotional need not
		being fulfilled, I would guess.
		채워지지 않는 감정적 기갈에 시달리고 있나 보군요
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	Are we done here?
		할 말은 그게 답니까?
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	Just getting started.
		이제 시작인데 어쩌나
00:12:07

00:12:17	Nice work.
		참 잘 한다 너도 
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	So I dug up
		a few possible witnesses
		처음 두 건에서 
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	in the first two cases.
		가능성 있는 용의자 둘을 발견했어
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	We got a power company guy
		on a job near the first killing,
		첫번째 살인 현장 근처에서 일하던 전력회사 직원하고 
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	a teacher whose car
		broke down on the second,
		두번째 현장 근처에서 차가 고장난 학교 교사
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	and the neighbor
		of the second kid, like that.
		두번째 피해자의 이웃이기도 했지 
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	Long shots. We'd do better
		using that psychic.
		까마득한데 차라리 영매를 쓰는게 나을지도 
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	I thought you liked
		all that spiritual stuff.
		은근히 그런거 좋아해 
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	What about
		your psychic cousin Yolanda?
		사촌 올랜다가 그런 끼 있다고 했잖아?
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	Yolanda's real.
		That guy's a fake.
		딴 사람은 몰라도 올랜다는 진짜야
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	Good luck.
		행운을 빌어 
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:37	You, too.
		너도
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	Mr. Walton, we understand
		the day the first boy vanished,
		첫번째 피해자가 실종된 날 
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	you were checking
		a downed power line
		마틴데일 로드에서 
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	on Martindale Road.
		끊어진 전선 정비 중이셨죠
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	Yep.
		That's what my records say.
		기록에는 그렇게 되어 있을 겁니다
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	You know, funny story
		about that.
		그런데 재밌는건요
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	They told me it was
		a damaged overhead conductor.
		전봇대가 고장났다더니 
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	Turns out it was
		a blown transformer.
		막상 가보니 변압기 문제지 뭐요
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Can you imagine?
		무슨 말인지 알겠어요?
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	I mean, I could have
		taken out the entire grid.
		근처 전선망을 싹 다 손볼뻔 했다니까요
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	Think back. Did you happen
		to notice anything
		일하시러 오가면서 
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	on your way
		to or from that job
		이 아이를 보신 기억은
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	or maybe this child?
		혹시 없으시구요?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	I'm not sure.
		What's the kid's name?
		잘 모르겠는데 애 이름이 뭐라구요?
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:07	Reggie Miranda.
		레기 미란다요
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	He was the second victim.
		두번째 피해자였습니다 
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Your car got a flat tire
		on Teer's Hill.
		티어힐에서 차가 주저앉으셨다죠
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	You remember seeing him
		at the bus stop?
		정류장에서 아이를 보신 기억이 안 나십니까?
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	Well, that wasn't
		a flat tire per se.
		실은 펑크난게 아니었어요
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	More like, uh,
		뭐냐면.. 
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	I told my girlfriend that,
		so we'd be stranded,
		그때 여자친구에겐 펑크가 나 꼼짝하지 않는다고 했는데 
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	she could get
		a little friendlier,
		실은 제 여자친구도 눈치챘지만 ... 
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	which she did, if you know
		what I mean.
		제 말 뭔지 아시겠죠
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	High five.
		하이파이브 
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	Come on. Give it up.
		에이, 한번만 해주세요 
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:32	As I was leaving,
		there was this black SUV,
		자리를 뜰때 검은 SUV 차량이 있었어요
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	nearly ran me off the road,
		제 옆으로 쌩 지나갔죠
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	which reminds me
		of another funny story...
		그러고보니 말인데... 
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:40	Black SUV.
		검은 SUV 
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	Power company guy says there was
		a ding in the front bumper.
		전력회사 직원 말론 앞범퍼가 움푹 패여 있었대 
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	Great. That narrows it down.
		좋아, 그럼 좁혀볼 수 있겠어 
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:53	Well, I think
		I can help you.
		도울 수 있을 것 같네요
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	Take my hand.
		제 손을 잡으세요
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	I want a baby
		more than anything.
		저는 너무너무 애가 갖고 싶어요
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	Shh. I know. Just...
		쉿, 알아요
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Listen.
		잘 들어보세요
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:12	In the beyond, Beth,
		I see your baby.
		아득한 너머에서, 당신 아이가 보여요
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:18	He's the light of your life.
		당신 아들은 당신 인생의 빛이 될 겁니다
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:20	He? It's a boy.
		아들이에요?
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Yes, a boy.
		그래요
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:28	His name is Connor.
		이름이 코너라고 하네요
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	Connor? That--
		that's my father's name.
		코너? 그건 저희 아버지 이름이에요 
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:42	A beautiful baby boy.
		예쁘고 귀여운 아이네요 
00:14:45	 
		 
00:15:07	That was Connor's favorite
		when he was a baby.
		코너 애기때 제일 좋아하는 인형이었어요
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	You know, he doesn't play
		with it anymore,
		이제 거들떠도 안 보지만 
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	but I just--
		I can't throw it out now.
		버릴 수가 없더라구요
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	You understand.
		아시겠죠
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	Yeah. Here.
		네 받으세요
00:15:16	 
		 
00:15:19	You know, Deke thinks
		I'm an idiot about you.
		덱은 내가 당신에게 속았다고 하더라구요
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	I mean, Jonathan
		probably does, too,
		조나단도 그렇게 생각하는 것 같고
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	but he's too nice to say so.
		하지만 마음이 약해 말을 않는거겠죠
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	You know,
		but they weren't there.
		그래도 그 둘은 그때 없었으니까, 
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	They didn't--they didn't see
		your powers at work.
		당신 능력을 못 봤으니까 하는 말이에요
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:30	There was nothing to see.
		볼 능력도 뭣도 없어요
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:34	Women that are trying hard
		to have babies often succeed,
		아이를 간절히 원하는 여자들은 대개 성공합니다
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	and when they do,
		그리고 애가 생기면, 
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	there's a 50/50 chance
		that it's a boy.
		50대 50확률로 남자애가 되죠
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	It was just a good guess.
		운이 좋아 맞춘 거예요
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	No, you knew.
		아뇨, 아셨던 거예요
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	And what was I to say,
		그러면 제가 거기서 
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	you were never gonna have
		a child?
		당신은 애를 못가진다고 말했겠어요?
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	Nobody wants
		a gloomy psychic.
		재수없는 소릴 하는 영매를 좋아하는 사람은 없죠
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:57	You had a child.
		You lost her.
		딸이 있었는데 잃었다면서요
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	I-I read about it
		in the papers.
		신문에서 읽었어요
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	Murdered?
		살해됐다구요?
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	Yeah.
		네
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	I'm sorry.
		정말 유감이네요
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	Yeah.
		네 
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	Is that why you deny
		your gift?
		그래서 본인 능력을 불신하는 건가요?
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	No.
		아뇨
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	Look, is Connor dead, too?
		Please. I'm sorry.
		코너도 죽은 건가요?
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	I'm sorry about before,
		but please just tell me.
		이런 얘기 정말 미안하지만 그냥 말씀해 주세요
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	It's just us right now, but--now
		just-- Beth, I-I can't tell you.
		- 이제 우리 둘뿐이니까...
		- 베스, 난 못해요
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	You have to tell me.
		We're just--
		그냥 말씀해 주세요
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	Beth. Oh, thank God.
		베스, 여기 있었군요 
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	I had a flash, and, uh...
		번쩍하고 스쳤어요
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	Mr. Glass,
		I told you to stay downstairs.
		글라스씨 아래층에 가 계시라고 말씀드렸는데 
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	Beth, I think I saw Connor.
		베스, 코너를 본 것 같아요
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	It was just a flash,
		but, um...
		그냥 번쩍한 것 뿐이지만.. 
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:28	Oh, please, Beth,
		don't listen to this nonsense.
		베스, 제발이지 저런 헛소리 귀담아 듣지 마요
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	No, where is he?
		Where--where is he?
		우리 애, 애 지금 어딨어요?
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	Is--is he alive?
		살아 있나요?
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	I don't know.
		It was just a split second.
		모르겠어요 잠깐 느낌이 온 거라
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	I need a vessel or...
		뭔가 염을 실을 물건이.. 
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	Connor's favorite.
		코너의 물건이 필요해요
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	From when he was a baby,
		of course.
		아이 때부터 지녔던, 이거네요
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	Of course. Nice read.
		좋은 눈썰미시네 
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	Mr. Glass, let's go.
		글라스씨, 갑시다
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	No, please, agent Lisbon.
		Please just--
		요원님, 잠시만요
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	No, Nate, tell me. Tell me.
		Go ahead.
		네이던, 계속해 보세요
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	Beth, it's all right.
		베스, 괜찮아요
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	I'm here.
		Mm.
		어디 안 갈게요
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	I need you
		to think with me, okay?
		함께 마음을 모아 주세요
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	I need you to think
		of Connor.
		코너를 생각해 주세요
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	He's filling your heart.
		코너의 생각으로 가득 채워요
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	He's filling your mind,
		okay?
		코너를 마음 속에 가득 채워요
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:04	Yes.
		그래요
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:07	Yes, I see him.
		이제 보여요
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:10	He's very still.
		고요히 있네요
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	He's dead?
		죽었어요?
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	No.
		아뇨
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	He's alive.
		살아 있어요
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	Sleeping.
		잠들어 있어요
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:21	Connor, wake up!
		일어나렴, 코너!
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	Can you hear me?!
		Your mother's here!
		내 말이 들리니? 엄마가 여기 계셔!
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:29	He's saying...
		코너가.. 
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	"I love you, mo mo."
		사랑해요 모모, 래요
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	"Mo mo." "Mo mo."
		That's what he calls me.
		모모, 모모! 우리 애가 절 부를때 그렇게 불러요
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	- What?
		- He calls me-- he calls me "mo mo."
		- 네?
		- 절 모모라고 부른다구요!
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	- Ohh.
		- Oh, God.
		오 저런
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	- I can't believe he's alive.
		- Ohh.
		애가 살아있다니! 
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	Yeah.
		 
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	Hallelujah.
		할렐루야
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	Mm. Amen.
		아멘 
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:49	Jonathan! Jonathan.
		조나단!
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	Jonathan, he's alive.
		Connor's alive. Nate sensed him.
		조나단, 코너가 살아있대! 네이던이 느꼈대!
00:17:54	 
		 
00:17:54	Oh, Nate sensed something
		all right--money.
		네이던이 뭔가 느끼긴 했죠 돈냄새 
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	What, you think Glass
		was faking?
		글라스가 사기를 치는 거라구요?
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Of course he was.
		당연하다마다요
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	Money-grubbin' bastard.
		돈을 갈퀴로 모을 도둑놈들 
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	No, no, no. It was Connor.
		He--he called me "mo mo."
		아니, 그건 코너였어요 모모,라고 했잖아요
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	That--that's
		his nickname for me.
		그건 코너가 지어준 내 별명이에요
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	N-nobody knew that.
		우리 둘만 아는건데 
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	That's exactly how
		the trick works, Beth.
		다들 그렇게 속이는 겁니다, 베스 
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	You use a detail that
		no one could possibly know,
		네이던 글라스만 빼곤 아무도 모를것 같은 디테일로 
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	except Nate Glass did know.
		그렇게 사기치는 거예요
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:15	He's been in and out
		of this house for two years.
		이 집에 드나든지 2년이라지 않았습니까 
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	No, no, I--no, I don't think
		he knew that name. No, I-I--
		아니, 네이던이 알리 없어요
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	How much money have you paid him
		since your husband died?
		바깥분 죽고 얼마나 돈을 갖다 바쳤습니까?
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	And how much more
		will you give him
		이제 사라진 아들을 느낀다니 
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	now that he can sense
		your son?
		또 얼마나 갖다 바칠 생각이세요?
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	And then if Connor dies
		만약 코너가 죽어버리고 
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	and Glass can contact
		his spirit,
		글라스가 그 영혼과 접신한다고 한다면 
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	what won't you give?
		내놓지 못할게 뭐 있겠습니까?
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	Hey, don't say that.
		Don't you dare.
		말 조심해요 
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	You're sick.
		Nate would never do that.
		당신 생각 정말 끔찍하네요 글라스가 그럴리 없어요
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	Of course he would.
		Believe me.
		그러고도 남지요 제 말 믿으세요
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	He would.
		그럴겁니다
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	No, you don't know, Patrick.
		패트릭, 당신은 몰라요
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	Apparently you don't know
		anything.
		아무것도 모르는게 분명해요
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	My son called out for me.
		우리 애가 저 밖에서 날 부르고 있다구요
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	He's alive,
		but you won't believe it,
		애는 살아있어요 당신은 믿지 않겠지만 
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	because you can't stand
		what you are,
		본인이 본인을 감당할 수 없으니까
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:49	so you just run away
		from yourself,
		그래서 당신 자신으로부터 도망치고 
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	and you hate anybody
		like you,
		당신 같은 모든 사람을 증오하고, 
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	and you hurt anybody
		who cares for you.
		당신을 염려하는 모든 사람을 부숴놔야 직성이 풀리겠죠
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	That doesn't mean
		I'm psychic.
		그런데 그게 제가 영매란 뜻은 아니죠
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	It just means that you're
		gullible and desperate.
		그냥 당신이 참 귀가 얇고 절망에 처해있단 뜻밖에 안 됩니다 
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	What is wrong with you
		that you treat people like that?
		당신은 대체 뭐가 문젠데 사람한테 말을 그따위로 해?
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	Oh, you should have seen me
		ten years ago.
		십년 전엔 저도 안 이랬어요
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:13	It's beautiful, huh?
		아름답죠?
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	It's all state forests
		that way.
		주정부에서 관리하는 삼림이라던데 
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	Nothing but bears and deer
		and elk.
		곰이나 사슴, 엘크가 지천이래요
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:22	Hmm.
		 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	You're pretty good.
		I'll give you that.
		썩 잘하네요 그건 인정하죠
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	Not great.
		Just... pretty good.
		훌륭하다고까진 못하겠지만 썩 잘하는건 맞아요
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	What can I say?
		It's a gift.
		뭐라겠습니까? 하늘이 주신 선물인걸 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	Yeah.
		 
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	See, here's the thing,
		Glass.
		그런데 말입니다, 글라스 
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	I played
		the same game myself,
		저도 옛날에 똑같이 놀아봐서 
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	so normally I wouldn't tell you
		not to run your little scam.
		보통은 이런 일 정색을 하고 말리진 않을건데, 
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	- Well, it's not a scam.
		- Hush. It's a scam.
		- 사기 아닙니다
		- 사기잖아요
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	We both know it's a scam,
		but you stepped over a line.
		톡까놓고 사기 맞잖습니까 게다가 당신 선을 넘고 있어요
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	This is police business.
		이건 경찰 소관이에요
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	There's a child's life
		at stake here.
		아이 목숨이 달린 문제란 말입니다
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	Yeah, that's why I'm here.
		그러니까 제가 여기 있죠
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	You don't want to push me.
		내 앞에서 적당히 해요
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	Back off this woman.
		여자한테 손 떼요
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	Get out of here right now,
		or you're gonna regret it.
		여기서 당장 꺼지지 않으면 크게 후회할거요
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Yeah. I can understand
		your frustration.
		당신 두려움은 이해합니다
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	You had the vision,
		and you lost it,
		누구라도 그런 능력을 가졌다 잃어버리면.. 
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	and I... I can't think
		of anything more horrible.
		내가 생각해도 참 끔찍하네요
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	You got a lot of nerve.
		꽤 배짱 있으시구만 
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	Maybe I've got you pegged
		all wrong.
		내가 사람을 잘못 본 모양이야
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	Maybe you're
		a kidnapper, too.
		어쩌면 당신이 범인일수도 있겠어 
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	Yeah.
		아
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	No, he's not the Balloon Man.
		I talked to Van Pelt.
		아니, 그쪽은 벌룬맨이 아냐 반펠트랑 통화했어
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	During the first two abductions,
		he was in New York and Atlanta
		처음 두 건의 납치 당시 
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	giving the presentation
		in front of 100 people.
		뉴욕과 애틀란타에서 백명을 앞에 놓고 강연 중이었어
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	Actually, it was 200.
		사실 이백명이었답니다
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	Yeah.
		아
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	Excuse me.
		실례하지요
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:32	Jane, we don't have time for you
		to have a feud with this guy.
		제인, 저 남자랑 시시콜콜하게 싸울 시간 같은거 없어 
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	I-it's like your conscience
		is battling your old self.
		양심의 가책 때문에 네 옛날 자신이랑 싸우는 거지, 
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	There's no upside.
		지금 도움될거 하나 없어 
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	You think that's why
		I'm here?
		내가 그래서 여기 붙어있는 것 같아?
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:42	That's intriguing.
		그거 재밌군 
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	Well, we have to go.
		A boy's life is on the line,
		우리 가야 돼 애 목숨이 경각에 달렸어 
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	and this man could take
		another kid and kill him.
		또 어디서 다른 애를 납치해 죽일지도 모르고 
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	Yeah. Let's go then.
		그래, 그럼 가자
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:52	So I'veeen trolling
		pedophile chat rooms.
		소아성애자가 모이는 채팅 사이트를 돌아다녔는데요,
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	There's this one guy,
		Charlie95--
		찰리95라는 남자, 
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	something's up with him.
		좀 수상합니다
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	He's a little too eager to chat
		about the first two boys.
		처음 두 피해자 얘기에 유난히 열을 올렸어요
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	Are you tracking him?
		추적했어?
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	Yep. IT says any minute now.
		전산팀에서 곧 결과 나온대요
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	Tell me
		you've got something better.
		넌 더 그럴듯한걸 물어왔길 바라
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:04	Been looking
		into this black SUV.
		그 전력회사 직원이 봤다는 검은 SUV 추적중인데요, 
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	The power company guy saw,
		cross-checking to see
		소아성애자가 차량 소유주였던 적이 있나
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	if any registered pedophiles
		own one.
		더블 체크 중입니다
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	- It's thin.
		- Yeah, it's thin.
		- 근데 별로군
		- 별로죠
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	We're not gonna make it,
		are we?
		소용없겠어요 그렇죠?
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	Jane, feel free
		to jump in any time.
		제인, 망설이지 말고 일어나 뭐든 말해 
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	I'm thinking.
		생각중 
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:21	The second boy, Reggie--
		it's bothering me.
		레기라는 애 때문에 마음이 쓰여
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	If he'd have gotten
		to the bus stop
		그 정류장에 3분만 
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:24	just three minutes later,
		늦게 갔어도 
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:26	he would have arrived at
		the same time as his classmate,
		학교 친구랑 만났을테고 
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	and Reggie would still be
		alive today.
		여전히 살아 있을텐데 
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	- Is that bad luck?
		- Or planning.
		- 운이 나쁜건가?
		- 아니면 계획적이었거나
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:33	Maybe the killer was watching
		for the perfect moment.
		살인자가 계속 주시했을수 있지 
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	But how could anyone have
		watched the first kid?
		그런데 첫번째 애를 본 사람이 있잖아요?
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	His bus stop was
		in a cul-de-sac.
		그 정류장은 막다른 골목이었어요
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	It's not visible
		from the main road.
		큰길에서는 안 보인다구요
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	I've got a picture
		of the first crime scene
		여기 어딘가 
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	somewhere here.
		첫번째 현장 사진이 있는데 
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	Charlie95 is Brady Walton,
		찰리95가 브래디 월튼이었어요
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	the power company guy
		we questioned.
		우리가 심문한 전력회사 직원이요
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	It can't be a coincidence.
		우연일수가 없어요
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:48	It isn't.
		없지 
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	The killer was watching
		from above.
		범인은 이 위에서 보고 있었던거야
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:54	Walton is the Balloon Man.
		월튼이 벌룬맨이야
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	Oh, my God.
		He was right here.
		이럴수가 방금 여기 있었는데 
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	- We had him.
		- Get Cho on the phone.
		- 다 잡아놨는데 
		- 조한테 연락해 
00:21:59	 
		 
00:21:59	Tell him we're moving in
		immediately. Let's go.
		바로 월튼 쫓아간다고 
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:11	Walton's registered four guns,
		AK소총을 포함해 월튼 앞으로 
00:22:12	 
		 
00:22:12	including an AK.
		네 정의 총기가 등록되어 있습니다
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	No telling how many
		he's really got.
		현재 얼마나 갖고 있는지는 모르죠
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Good to know.
		Here's how it's gonna work.
		그거라도 알면 됐어 이렇게 하자
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	Van Pelt and I are gonna take
		the three-four corner.
		반펠트랑 나는 3, 4번 코너를 지킬게 
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	You and Cho are gonna take
		the one-two.
		너랑 조는 1, 2번 코너를 맡아
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	Now be careful.
		The kid could still be in there.
		그리고 애가 아직 안에 있을지 모르니 조심하고 
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:49	You ain't gettin' me!
		날 잡을순 없을거다!
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:51	Not gonna happen!
		그렇겐 안되지!
00:22:52	 
		 
00:23:02	Lisbon, we're pinned.
		반장님, 갇혔어요
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	We're pinned
		on the two side.
		2번 코너에서 갇혔어요
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:05	Take the three corner.
		3번 코너 가서 잡아
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	Let me know when you're
		in position.
		위치에 다다르면 연락해 
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:19	Rigs, I got a clear path
		to the front door.
		릭스, 난 현관 바로 앞이야
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	Stand by.
		대기해
00:23:23	 
		 
00:23:27	It may be too late for me,
		너무 늦었을진 모르지만
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	but I ain't going to prison!
		난 감옥엔 안 갈거야!
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	I ain't going quiet!
		순순히 잡히진 않을거다!
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:38	Van Pelt,
		are you in position?
		반펠트, 위치야?
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:41	Van Pelt?
		반펠트?
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:44	Van Pelt?
		반펠트?
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:49	Van Pelt?
		반펠트?
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:53	Screw you, bi--
		죽어라 이.. 
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:55	Ohh!
		 
00:23:56	 
		 
00:24:07	Everybody okay?
		모두 괜찮아요?
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:08	Find the kid.
		애 찾아
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:13	Lisbon!
		반장님!
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:15	I'm all right.
		Walton's down.
		괜찮아, 월튼은 쓰러졌어
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:19	Walton, stay with us.
		월튼, 정신차려
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:22	Where's the kid? Tell us.
		Where's Connor?
		코너는 어딨어? 말해! 
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	How would I know?
		내가 어떻게 알아?
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:29	He's lying. Gotta be.
		거짓말일거야
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:31	Boss, the house is clear.
		The kid's not in there.
		반장님, 애는 여기 없어요
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:38	Hey, Jane.
		제인
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:41	We got Walton.
		월튼을 잡았어
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	The kid's nowhere
		to be seen.
		애는 어디서도 안 보여
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	Tell Rigsby to look
		in his left pocket.
		릭스비한테 왼쪽 바지 주머니 보라고 해 
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:46	There should be a note.
		쪽지가 있을거야
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:50	Rigs, is there a note
		in your left pants pocket?
		릭스, 바지 주머니에 쪽지 있어?
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:58	"The Balloon Man didn't
		take Connor."
		"벌룬맨은 코너를 데려가지 않았다"
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	Okay, so how did he do that?
		이거 어떻게 한거야?
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:07	Hey.
		여어
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	So videotape puts Brady Walton
		at a 7-Eleven across town
		코너가 납치된 시각에 
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	while Connor was being
		snatched.
		월튼은 편의점 cctv에 찍혔어
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	Damn it.
		제길
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:14	Yeah, Walton killed
		those other two boys,
		월튼이 먼젓번 애 둘을 죽인건 맞지만
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:16	but he didn't take Connor.
		코너는 아니야
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	We've got a copycat.
		모방범이었어
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	So Jane was right.
		제인 말이 맞네
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	Jane was right.
		제인 말이 맞았네 
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	I gotta find Lisbon.
		She's not in her office.
		반장님 찾아야겠어 사무실에 없던데 
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:23	Hey, Grace,
		well done anyway.
		그레이스, 아무튼 훌륭했어
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:26	You took down
		a seriously bad guy.
		어쨌거나 악당을 잡았잖아 
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	Another day, another dollar.
		줏어먹은거지 뭘 
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:30	Hey.
		저기, 
00:25:32	 
		 
00:25:32	You okay?
		괜찮은거야?
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	Yeah.
		I feel pretty good actually.
		응, 실은 기분이 꽤 좋아
00:25:36	 
		 
00:25:36	I'm starting to enjoy
		shooting people.
		사람 쏘는게 슬슬 재밌어지나봐
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:41	Gotcha.
		속았지
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:44	No, you didn't.
		아니거든
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:45	Yes, I did.
		맞네요
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	You didn't get me.
		저 안 속았거든요
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:48	I did.
		그랬어요
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:55	Walton has an alibi
		for Connor's abduction.
		월튼은 코너 사건에는 알리바이가 있어
00:25:58	 
		 
00:25:58	Mm.
		How did you know?
		어떻게 안 거야?
00:25:59	 
		 
00:25:59	Well, something was just,
		uh, a little off.
		뭐가 좀 살짝 안 맞길래
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:01	The other kids Walton killed
		were older.
		월튼이 죽인 다른 두 애는 나이가 더 있고 
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	They had dark hair.
		둘다 검은 머리니까
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	That's it?
		그게 다야?
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	Just a good guess.
		운좋게 맞춘거지 
00:26:08	 
		 
00:26:08	Why the hell didn't you
		tell me?
		왜 진작 말 안하고?
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:09	Would you have done anything
		differently?
		말했다고 안 갔을라고?
00:26:11	 
		 
00:26:11	Probably not.
		그건 그렇지만 
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	Walton was bad.
		월튼은 나쁜 놈이었으니까
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:15	Then there's no need
		to be cranky.
		그럼 이러고 짜증낼 이유도 없네 
00:26:17	 
		 
00:26:17	So who took Connor?
		그럼 코너는 누가 데려간거야?
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	Don't know.
		I'm still working on that.
		몰라 나도 계속 생각 중이야
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	Is he alive?
		살아는 있는거야?
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	I hope so.
		그러길 바라야지 
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:24	So we're back to square one
		on this one.
		다시 처음으로 돌아왔네 
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	First principle--motive.
		동기부터 따져야지 
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	Why would somebody vanish
		a 9-year-old boy?
		왜 9살짜리 애에게 손을 댄 걸까?
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:31	To hide evidence
		he was beaten, maybe?
		폭행의 산증거를 감추기 위해?
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	Abuse? Meh. No.
		아동학대? 메에, 아냐
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	This has the whiff
		of something more tangled,
		훨씬 복잡하게 꼬여있고 
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	more interesting.
		흥미로운 뭔가의 냄새가 솔솔 나
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	Money?
		돈?
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:41	We dismissed it because
		there was no ransom demand,
		몸값 요구가 없길래 그 생각은 치워놨지만 
00:26:43	 
		 
00:26:43	but there's other ways
		to get money.
		돈 나올 방법은 그 밖에도 있잖아 
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	Connor inherited half
		of your husband's estate,
		코너는 아버지 부동산의 반을 물려받았죠
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	isn't that right,
		Mrs. Flint--$20 million?
		2천만 달러 가량 되나요, 부인?
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:50	Uh, y--uh, yes.
		네, 그래요
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	It's being held in a trust
		until he turns 30.
		애가 서른이 될때까지 신탁에 잡혀 있죠
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	Why?
		왜요?
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	And, uh, who inherits
		if Connor dies?
		코너가 죽으면 누구 차지가 되죠?
00:26:57	 
		 
00:26:57	He's--no, he's just
		a little boy.
		코너는 아직 어린애인데요
00:26:59	 
		 
00:26:59	He's not supposed to die
		at all.
		애가 죽다니 말이나 되나요
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:00	Wh...
		 
00:27:02	 
		 
00:27:02	According to the terms
		of the trust,
		신탁 증서를 보니 
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	you get everything.
		전부 부인한테 가네요
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	Are you saying that I--
		that I killed my son?
		지금 제가 제 아이를 죽였다는 말씀이세요?
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	The thing is,
		실은, 
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	we looked into everybody
		in the family's financials.
		가족분들 재정상황을 다 들여다 봤습니다 
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	Jonathan's worth
		$30 million,
		조나단의 신탁은 3천만 달러가량 되네요
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	but you need money,
		don't you, Mrs. Flint?
		돈이 필요하시죠, 부인?
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	I-I don't--
		I don't know what you mean.
		무슨 말씀이신지 모르겠어요
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	I-I don't know what
		I'm doing in this room.
		제가 이 방에서 뭘 하는지도 모르겠구요
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:22	According to the bank,
		은행에 알아보니 
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:23	you have $100,000
		in credit card debt.
		카드빚으로 십만달러 정도 갖고 계시던데 
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:27	You've spent everything
		your husband left you
		남편에게 물려받은 유산을 전부 쓰시고도 
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	and then some.
		빚까지 내셨군요
00:27:31	 
		 
00:27:31	I've made some--
		some bad investments,
		무리한 투자를 좀 했어요
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:34	and I-I'm just not very good
		with numbers.
		그리고 숫자에는 꽝이라서, 
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	I always relied on James
		for that.
		그런건 늘 남편이 알아서 했어요
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	Could you please sit down?
		좀 앉아 주시겠습니까?
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:46	Thank you.
		감사합니다
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:49	That must have been
		really stressful for you,
		본인의 재정상황 때문에 
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	your financial situation.
		스트레스를 많이 받으셨겠군요
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	It's--it's
		very embarrassing.
		당혹스러운 일이죠
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	I mean,
		I couldn't even tell Deke.
		덱에게도 말할 수 없었어요
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:59	Uh, could you excuse me?
		잠시만 실례할까요?
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:05	Her family's here with a lawyer.
		가족이 변호사를 대동해 왔어요
00:28:07	 
		 
00:28:07	We gotta charge her
		or kick her.
		무혐의면 내보내야해요
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:15	Maybe you snapped.
		홧김에 그러셨을수도 있죠
00:28:17	 
		 
00:28:17	It's understandable.
		충분히 이해는 갑니다
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:19	One weak moment,
		and you saw a way out.
		순간 마음이 약해진 때 출구가 보였겠죠
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	If something were
		to happen to Connor,
		코너에게 무슨 일만 생기면 
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:23	all your problems
		would be over.
		모든 문제가 한방에 해결이니까요
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:25	If something happens
		to Connor,
		코너에게 무슨 일이라도 생기면 
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:28	my @@/life@@\ will be over.
		제 인생 자체가 한방에 가요
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:30	Please, @@/please@@\
		just help me find my boy.
		제발 저희 아이 좀 찾아주세요
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:41	Are you okay?
		괜찮아?
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:42	I'm fine. I'm fine.
		난 괜찮아
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:45	What did they want?
		경찰에서 뭐래?
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	Well, they a-asked me a lot
		of questions about money.
		돈 관련해서만 자꾸 물어봐
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	It was just stupid.
		쓸데없이
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:50	I think mom's clean.
		What are you thinking?
		애 엄마는 깨끗한거 같은데 어떻게 생각해?
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	What was I thinking?
		내 생각?
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:54	I was thinking, uh...
		내 생각은... 
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	love is strange,
		사랑이란 참 묘하구나
00:28:59	 
		 
00:28:59	and I was thinking about
		a sandwich.
		그리고 샌드위치 먹고 싶다
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:03	Uh, you know who else is
		profiting
		코너가 납치되면 
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:05	from Connor's abduction?
		쏠쏠한 사람이 또 누구게?
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:07	- Who?
		- Nathan Glass.
		- 누구?
		- 네이던 글라스 
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:09	Uh, he alibied out
		for the first two kids,
		앞의 두 아이에 관해선 알리바이가 있지만 
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	but not Connor,
		and maybe he took him
		이번 사건엔 없지 
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	to cement his relationship
		with Beth.
		베스와 관계를 돈독히 하려고 코너에게 손을 댔을지도 
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	Well, he's certainly
		heartless enough.
		인면수심의 캐릭터는 맞아
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	We'll get him in a room.
		심문할까
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:19	No, he'll just clam up.
		아니, 조개처럼 입을 다물걸 
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:20	What if we can get him
		to lead us to Connor?
		차라리 알아서 코너한테 가게 하는건 어때?
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	That would be nice.
		그러면 최고지 
00:29:23	 
		 
00:29:23	Boss, forensics came back
		with the labs
		반장님, 
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	on Connor's school bus stop.
		검시관이 현장 분석 결과를 보내왔습니다
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	Nothing?
		뭐 있어?
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	Nope.
		The only weird thing is,
		없어요 근데 이상한건요, 
00:29:30	 
		 
00:29:30	there were traces
		of white fir pollen
		코너가 픽업됐을거라 짐작되는 자리에서 
00:29:32	 
		 
00:29:32	in the spot where they think
		that Connor was grabbed.
		전나무 꽃가루가 검출됐대요
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:34	There are no white firs there.
		Just pines.
		근처엔 소나무 뿐이고 전나무는 없는데 
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	All right. Thanks.
		그래, 수고했어
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	Okay.
		 
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:40	Yes. Got it.
		이제 알겠다
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:48	Thank you, Caroline.
		고마워, 캐롤라인
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:51	Let's get out of here.
		집에 가자
00:29:53	 
		 
00:29:53	Any news?
		무슨 소식이라도?
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	No, uh, listen,
		I just wanted to say
		아, 저기...전 단지.. 
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	I'm sorry for everything
		that's happened.
		당신한테 일어난 일들, 진심으로 미안하게 생각합니다
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	What's the matter?
		왜 그래요?
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	Nothing.

00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	Uh...W--

		- 잠깐요
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	- Beth.
		- Wait, wait. No, Patrick.
		- 베스
		- 아니, 잠깐요 패트릭 잠깐만 
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	When--when you--you grabbed
		my hand, you--something--
		당신이 내 손 잡았을 때 뭔가.. 
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:07	- Uh, n-nothing happened at all.
		- Something happened.
		- 아, 아무것도 없었어요
		- 뭔가 있는거죠
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	Are you...
		당신... 
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	- No! No, no.
		- Are you sensing something?
		- 아니! 하지마요
		- 뭔가 느낀거예요?
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:11	No. No.
		아니에요
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	Liar. Liar.
		거짓말 하고 있군요
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:17	I see...
		실은... 
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	There's a face.
		얼굴이 보여요
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:23	What's wrong?
		무슨 일이에요?
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	It's Connor.
		코너예요
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	- It is?
		- Oh, my God.
		- 뭐?
		- 이런.. 
00:30:28	 
		 
00:30:28	Jane, what are you doing?
		제인씨, 지금 뭐하는 겁니까?
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	I don't understand.
		도저히 모르겠어
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:31	He's standing right there
		in front of me.
		애가 바로 내 앞에 서 있어
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:33	Lisbon.
		리스본
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	What is it?
		뭔데?
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	Lisbon, I don't like this.
		I don't like this.
		리스본, 나 이런 거 싫어 나 이거 싫어 
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	What's going on?
		무슨 일인데?
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	No. There's someone there.
		I see someone.
		저기 누가 있어 누가 보여
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	Oh, wait.
		Wait. There's someone.
		오, 잠깐 누가 있네 
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	Are--they're following.
		쫓아가 
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	They're gonna catch me.
		날 잡으려나봐
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	Sweating.
		땀이 나
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	His abductor?
		납치범?
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	Oh, come on. This is crap.
		진짜, 이건 다 쓰레기라고
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	Shh.
		쉿
00:30:57	 
		 
00:31:01	I can't do it.
		못하겠어
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	I can't do it.
		He's just a little boy.
		못 보겠어 저렇게 어린 아이를... 
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	I-I...
		나, 난... 
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	Connor. Connor.
		코너, 코너
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	Yes, yes. Connor.
		Connor. Where is Connor?
		그래요, 코너 어디있어요?
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	There's a--there's a light,
		and it dances.
		불빛이 있는데, 흔들려요
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	It just dance--
		it dances on the water.
		흔들려요, 물 위에서
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	- It's dancing on the water.
		- Oh, God.
		- 물 위에서 어른거려요
		- 이런
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	- It's so beautiful.
		- Connor. Connor's near water.
		- 아름다운.. 
		- 코너가 물 근처에 있나봐요
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:23	It's a--it's a strong smell,
		like, uh... spicy,
		쏘는 냄새가 나는데, 매운 냄새.. 
00:31:27	 
		 
00:31:27	- like Christmas, uh, trees.
		- Pine trees?
		- 마치 크리스마스, 아니, 나무야
		- 소나무?
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	It's like pine trees,
		but different.
		소나무 같은데 달라
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	Oh, and the bad--
		이거 안 좋은데 
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	there's a bad smell,
		a bad taste.
		역해 역한 냄새야 
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	Pungent.
		코를 찔러
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Gunpowder.
		Yeah, it's gunpowder.
		화약이구나, 그래, 화약이야
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	It's bad.
		이거 나빠
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:46	And you can almost see
		the house.
		그리고 거의 집 같은게 보여
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	He's just surrounded.
		아이가 둘러싸여 있어
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	There's wood, wood and trees,
		and--and--and...
		나무, 판자, 나무, 그리고.. 
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:56	Uh, he's in a cabin.
		오두막 안에 있어
00:31:59	 
		 
00:31:59	It's not a cabin. It's a...
		오두막이 아닌가, 
00:32:01	 
		 
00:32:01	No, it's like a, uh,
		it's smaller, like a sh--
		그보다 작은.. 
00:32:05	 
		 
00:32:05	Ohh. I'm tired.
		너무 피곤해 
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	Jane. Wake up.
		제인, 일어나
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:09	Jane, wake up!
		일어나, 제인!
00:32:11	 
		 
00:32:11	What happened?
		방금 무슨 일이었어?
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:13	I don't know.
		몰라
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	I was gonna ask you that.
		That was weird.
		안 그래도 하도 이상해서 너한테 물어보려던 참인데 
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:16	- No, I-I knew you could sense him.
		- Please don't touch me.
		- 영감이 올 줄 알았어요
		- 저한테 손대지 마세요
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	- I knew you could sense him.
		- Don't touch me.
		- 영감이 올 줄 알았다구요
		- 손대지 마시라구요
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:19	Get all of your neighbors...
		이웃분들이랑 
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	and volunteers.
		자원봉사자 다 소집해요
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:22	Karl, I want you to call
		the sheriff's department.
		칼, 보안관서에 전화해요
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	Cho will lead the search
		of the state forest.
		조요원이 수색대 끌고 주립 공원으로 들어갈 거고
00:32:26	 
		 
00:32:26	We'll start
		at the Flint property line.
		우린 플린트 사유지 방향에서 출발합시다
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:28	One hour. Let's go.
		1시간내로, 출발 
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	Come on!
		갑시다
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:37	See, that's how you do
		a psychic reading, huh?
		이 정도는 해야 영매라는 거예요
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:42	Whew.
		 
00:32:45	 
		 
00:33:17	Drop the knife! Do it now!
		칼 버려! 당장!
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:20	Are you deaf?
		Drop it, Flint!
		귀 먹었나, 칼 버려 플린트! 
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:22	I wasn't gonna hurt him,
		I swear.
		해치려던 게 아니에요, 맹세해요
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:25	Get on your knees.
		Put your hands on your head.
		무릎 끓고 두 손 머리 위로 올려
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:37	Connor?
		코너?
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:43	Connor.
		코너
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	Connor, I'm agent Van Pelt.
		I'm from the CBI.
		코너, CBI의 반펠트 요원이야
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:48	I'm here to help you.
		널 구하러 왔어
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	Are you okay?
		괜찮니?
00:33:50	 
		 
00:33:50	Yeah.
		 
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:53	Ohh.
		 
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:55	I was just there
		looking for Connor.
		코너를 찾아간 거였어요
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:57	This is all
		a big misunderstanding.
		이건 정말 엄청난 오해가 있는 겁니다
00:33:59	 
		 
00:33:59	You wanted Connor dead.
		당신은 코너를 죽이려 했어
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	You grabbed him
		and then made it look like
		아이를 납치해 
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	a child murderer did it.
		소아성애자 소행으로 꾸미려 든거야
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:05	Which part are
		we misunderstanding?
		우리가 잘못 이해한 부분이 어디지?
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	But you couldn't bring
		yourself
		하지만 이복 동생을 
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	to kill your baby brother
		face-to-face,
		제 손으로 죽일 순 없었겠지 
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:10	so you left him
		in that duck blind--
		그래서 음식도 물도 없이 
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	no food, no water,
		no chance.
		오두막에 처넣은거야
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:15	No, that's not true.
		그렇지 않아요
00:34:17	 
		 
00:34:17	Why would I want Connor dead?
		I don't need his money.
		내가 왜 코너를 죽이겠어요? 난 코너 돈이 필요 없어요
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	Love.
		You are in love with Beth.
		베스를 사랑했잖아
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:24	@@/What are you thinking?@@\
		네 생각은?
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:26	@@/Uh, I was thinking...@@\
		내 생각은.. 
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:29	@@/love is strange.@@\
		사랑이란 묘하구나
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:33	Jane called this one right.
		제인이 그러더군 
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	He was in love with Beth,
		남자는 베스를 사랑하고 있는데, 
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	only she didn't see him
		that way,
		베스는 그렇게 생각 않는것 같다고
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	so how was he gonna
		change that?
		그럼 이걸 어떡해야 하나?
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	Kill her kid and then be
		there to comfort her,
		아이를 죽이고 여자를 달래주면서 
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	pick up the broken pieces.
		조각난 마음을 붙여줘야지 
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:42	No! I always planned on g--
		아녜요! 오히려 난 ... 
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:44	Always planned what, Jonathan?
		What did you plan?
		오히려 뭐? 원래 계획은 뭐였나?
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:54	I had always planned
		to go get him
		애를 구해다 
00:34:57	 
		 
00:34:57	and bring him back.
		엄마한테 돌려주려 했어요
00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:58	Play the hero.
		영웅 놀이 
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:01	Put on a mask, kidnap Connor,
		마스크를 쓰고 코너를 납치한 다음에 
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:04	then go find him later,
		rescue him.
		후에 발견한 척 구출해온다 
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:07	And then Beth is filled
		with gratitude
		그럼 베스는 감사의 마음으로 가득차 
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	and falls
		into your manly arms.
		당신의 든든한 팔에 안기는 거군 
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	Bingo.
		빙고 
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	That's a dumb plan.
		바보같은 계획이군 
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:14	I was going
		to bring him back!
		애를 돌려주려 했어요!
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:19	So what was the knife for?
		그럼 칼은 뭐야?
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	I...
		그... 
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	I didn't...
		난... 
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:30	Planning is easy.
		Reality's a bit harder.
		계획은 간단했지만 막상 하려니 쉽지 않았겠지 
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	What if Connor recognized you?
		What if Jane is psychic?
		코너가 날 알아보면? 제인이 진짜 영매라면?
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	Better just to make
		a clean break
		차라리 애를 죽이고 
00:35:39	 
		 
00:35:39	and kill the kid, right?
		깔끔하게 끝내자, 생각한거지?
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	He is.
		맞잖아요
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:44	Jane's psychic...
		제인은 영매잖아요... 
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	Isn't he?
		아니에요?
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	Nah.
		땡 
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:49	We followed you.
		You led us to Connor.
		당신이 우릴 코너한테 안내한거야
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	No.
		아냐
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	No, no, no.
		That's impossible.
		아냐, 그럴수가 없는데 
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:56	The stuff Mr. Jane said,
		that he saw Connor,
		코너를 봤다는 그 말, 
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	the--the trees,
		the smell of gunpowder,
		나무며, 화약 냄새... 
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:01	near a-a body of water--
		it was all accurate.
		근처에 물이 있고.. 다 정확하게 맞았어요
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:03	How the hell did he do it?!
		대체 그걸 어떻게 안 거래요?
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:15	Mom. Mommy!
		엄마!
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	Hi.
		엄마
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	Hi, baby.
		Oh, baby, you're home.
		아가, 우리 아가가 돌아왔구나
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:21	You're home. You're safe.
		넌 이제 안전해 
00:36:23	 
		 
00:36:23	- Yeah, welcome home, buddy.
		- Ohh.
		돌아온걸 환영한다
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:26	Ohh. Mm.
		 
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	Look at you. Oh, my God.
		우리 아가, 오 하느님 
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	Ohh. I'm just happy, okay?
		너무 기뻐서 그래 
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	You want some French toast?
		I made you some French toast.
		프렌치 토스트 먹을래? 엄마가 만들어 줄게 
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:35	French toast is for breakfast.
		아침에만 먹는건데 
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	It's a special occasion.
		특별한 날이니까 괜찮아
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:39	Come on.
		가자
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	Come on.
		가자
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	Congratulations, Mr. Jane.
		축하합니다, 제인씨 
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	Oh. Yes, yes. Uh...
		아, 네 
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:49	You son of a bitch.
		You trying to steal my action?
		이런 천하의 개자식, 지금 누구 밥그릇을 빼앗으려고?
00:36:52	 
		 
00:36:52	Mr. Glass,
		nice to finally meet you,
		글라스씨 이제 진짜로 뵙네요
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	and you got no action.
		그리고 당신 몫의 밥그릇은 없어 
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	You're a disgrace
		to the profession.
		당신은 업계의 수치야
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:58	That contact you faked
		with Connor--
		코너와 영감이 통했다며 보여준 연기... 
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	weak, weak.
		약했어, 약했어 
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	Bite me.
		That gag was seamless.
		웃기지마, 그건 완전히 먹혀 들어갔어
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	You see how she fell for it?
		여자 반응 봤지?
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:07	"Ohh. Mo mo. Mo mo."
		모모, 모모!
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:14	Thanks. That should do it.
		고마워라 이거면 충분해 
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	Excuse me?
		뭐?
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	And, uh, stop.
		스톱
00:37:21

		"모모, 모모!"
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	@@/"Mo mo."@@\

00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:28	Bye.
		잘 가시라
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:39	Don't leave.
		가지 마 엄마
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:40	I won't.
		We'll be right over there.
		어디 안 가 바로 앞에 있을거야
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:48	So...
		그래서... 
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	You gonna tell me
		how you did it?
		어떻게 했는지 말해줄래요?
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:52	Everything you said came true,
		당신 말이 전부 맞아 들어갔지만, 
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	but it was a trick, wasn't it?
		다 속임수였다는 거죠?
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:59	Yeah.
		네 
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:02	How?
		그럼 어떻게?
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:05	Well, um...
		음.. 
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:09	being held not far
		from home.
		집에서 멀지 않은 곳에 있을거라고 본 건, 
00:38:11	 
		 
00:38:11	Uh, the police shut down
		the roads
		코너가 납치되고 
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	immediately
		after Connor's abduction.
		지역 경찰이 그 즉시 도로를 폐쇄했기 때문이고 
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:16	The lake--
		호수는.. 
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:18	there's always a body
		of water nearby, always.
		물 같은건 항상 있으니까요 도처에 
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:21	Trees, leaves, earth--
		나무며, 잎사귀며 흙이며.. 
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:24	there was, uh,
		white fir pollen
		그건 버스 정류장에서 
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	found at, uh,
		at the bus stop,
		전나무 꽃가루가 발견됐기 때문입니다 
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	and where could you hide
		anyone in a forest?
		그럼 누군가를 숲속에 숨기려면 
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	Hunting blind,
		hence the gunpowder,
		사냥 오두막이 딱이죠 화약은 그래서였고 
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	and I was watching
		Jonathan's face the whole time.
		그리고 조나단의 얼굴을 계속 살피고 있었어요
00:38:39	 
		 
00:38:39	I could see whenever
		my guesses landed.
		제 추측이 맞아 들어갈 때마다 표정이...
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	Of course.
		그랬겠죠
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:48	Elegant.
		감탄스럽네요
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:55	You know,
		all those years ago,
		당년에.. 
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	when you were a psychic
		당신이 영매일때, 
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	and... you were lying to me,
		내 미래에 대해 말해준 모두가 
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	telling me about my future--
		거짓말이었다는 거네요
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:05	Yeah, I'm--I'm very sorry
		about that.
		정말 죄송했습니다
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	Don't apologize.
		사과하지 말아요
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:09	You tried to tell me.
		나한테 계속 사실을 말하려 했잖아요, 
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:12	You deceived me, sure...
		날 속이기도 했지만, 
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:17	But you gave me hope.
		어쨌든 당신은 제게 희망을 줬어요
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:23	Thank you for that.
		제가 감사했어요
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:31	Good-bye, Patrick.
		잘 가요, 패트릭 
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:35	Bye, Beth.

00:39:59	Cheer up.
		기운 내라 
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:00	Oh, I'm cheery.
		기운 짱짱한걸
00:40:01	 
		 
00:40:02	You heard her.
		You gave her hope.
		들었잖아, 네가 희망을 줬대 
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:04	I didn't give her hope.
		준 적 없어
00:40:06	 
		 
00:40:06	I sold her hope.
		팔았지 
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:08	I think hope is worth it
		at any price.
		희망은 값을 매길 수 없는거야
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	What, are you running
		for office now?
		지금 사무실 가는거 맞아?
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	Okay, you know what?
		아, 알았어 
00:40:14	 
		 
00:40:14	Uh, you're a wicked charlatan...
		너처럼 막되먹은 사기꾼은
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:16	and you're going
		to hell then.
		지옥으로 직행해야 돼 
00:40:17	 
		 
00:40:17	That's more like it.
		너는 역시 그러는게 낫다
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:18	I'll save you a seat
		by the fire.
		불가 자리로 예약해 놓을게 
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:19	Oh, I'm not going to hell.
		난 지옥 안 가는데

		- 아니지 
00:40:23	 
		 
00:40:23	You've made
