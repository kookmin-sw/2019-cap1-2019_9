00:00:05	I could see the glow
		from around the corner.
		모퉁이도 돌기 전에 불꽃이 보일 지경이었어요
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	I thought
		the whole alley was on fire.
		온 골목에 불이 붙은줄 알았죠 
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	What were you doing out here?
		거기서 뭘 하고 계셨죠?
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	Delivering pizzas.
		피자 배달 중이었어요 
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	I like to use this alley
		as a shortcut.
		이 골목이 지름길이거든요 
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	And did you see anybody
		when you were out?
		근처에서 아무도 보지 못하셨나요?
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	No, just, uh, you know,
		the guy in the car,
		차 안에 사람이 있었죠 
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	and--and I didn't even see him
		at first. Too much smoke.
		처음엔 연기가 너무 짙어 있는 줄도 몰랐어요 
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Was he still alive?
		그때까지 살아있던가요?
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	I don't think so, no.
		아니었을걸요 
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	I mean, how could he be,
		handcuffed inside a burning car?
		불타는 차에 수갑으로 묶였는데
		살 수가 있었을까요? 
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Who is he, anyway?
		그나저나 누구였죠?
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	We're still working on that.
		저희도 알아보는 중입니다
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	Poor bastard. Burned alive?
		That's no way to to go.
		산채로 불에 타다니, 다른 방법도 많았을텐데 
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:58	Oh, hey, Cho.
		Scared the hell out of me.
		조, 놀라 기절하는 줄 알았잖아 
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:01	I just found these.
		이런게 나왔습니다 
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	That's very careless
		of someone...
		누군지 몰라도 부주의했군
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:06	or perhaps careful.
		아니면 주의한다고 했거나 
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:30	What'd you find?
		뭐라도 찾았어?
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	Not sure yet.
		아직 모르겠어 
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:36	Cover me.
		엄호해줘
00:01:37

00:02:09	 
		 
00:02:09	Oh, we're not here
		for what you're here for.
		뭔지 몰라도 그것 때문에 온 건 아니구요 
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	Does this belong to anyone?
		이 물건 주인 계십니까? 
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:16	I guess it's true
		what they say--
		옛 말 틀린거 하나 없네 
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:17	"time wounds all heels."
		These are my favorite.
		세월은 모든 뒤축을 닳게 한다더니, 
		제가 가장 아끼는 구두였어요 
00:02:20

00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:25	We do a cabaret.
		저희는 카바레 팀이랍니다 
00:02:27	 
		 
00:02:27	We found your heel
		in the alleyway,
		골목에선 당신 뒷굽 말고도
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:29	along with a dead man.
		시체가 발견됐습니다 
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	He'd been set on fire.
		불에 타 죽었지요 
00:02:32	 
		 
00:02:32	Oh, we heard the sirens outside,
		but we had no idea.
		밖에서 사이렌 소리를 들었지만
		무슨 일인지는 전혀 몰랐어요 
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	What were you doing
		in the alley?
		골목에서 뭘 하고 계셨죠?
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:37	Enjoying an Ultra Slim.
		제일 좋아하는 담배를 즐겼죠 
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	I always smoke a cigarette
		before the first show.
		첫 공연 전엔 꼭 한대씩 피우거든요 
00:02:42	 
		 
00:02:42	And what time were you
		out there?
		그 나가신 시각이?
00:02:44	 
		 
00:02:44	I don't know exactly. 8:30?
		잘은 모르겠어요, 8시 반이었나? 
00:02:46	 
		 
00:02:46	The arson investigator
		says the fire was set
		화재 전문가 말에 의하면 
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	sometime
		between 8:45 and 9:00.
		불은 8시 45분에서 9시 사이에 났다고 합니다 
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:51	Oh, well, Glennda was with us
		by then.
		글린다는 그때 저희와 같이 있었어요 
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:53	Yeah, that's right.
		맞아요 
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54	She helped me
		into my compression garments.
		코르셋 입는걸 도와줬죠 
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:55	I was. Who died? Who was it?
		누가 죽었는데요?
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	- We don't know.
		- Two minutes to curtain, girls.
		- 저희도 모릅니다 
		- 공연 시작 2분 전이야! 
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	Whoo!
		 
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	If you'll excuse me,
		the stage is calling.
		실례지만 무대가 절 부르는군요 
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	Hang on a minute. Did you see
		anybody in the alley?
		잠깐만요, 골목에서 아무도 보지 못했나요? 
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	As a matter of fact,
		there was a man
		말이 나와 말인데 남자가 있었어요 
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	in a parked car,
		watching me.
		차 안에서 절 바라보더군요 
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	What did he look like?
		어떻게 생겼던가요?
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	I couldn't see his face.
		얼굴은 잘 못봤어요 
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	It was dark
		But I felt vulnerable,
		너무 어둡고 무서웠거든요 
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	so I hightailed it back
		into the club,
		클럽으로 부리나케 도망쳤는데 
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:14	and that's when I felt
		my heel break.
		나중에 보니 굽이 달아나 있더군요 
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:16	Why didn't you pick up
		your heel?
		왜 굽을 줏어오지 않았죠? 
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	In this dress, darling?
		자기, 이렇게 입고 말예요? 
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	It's time to welcome
		그토록 고대하시던 
00:03:23

		you're dying to possess--
		새크라멘토의 공주님들을 만나보실 시간입니다 
00:03:25

00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:32	♪
		 
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	I think he's telling
		the truth.
		저 남자 말 거짓말이 아닌것 같아 
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	I don't know.
		난 모르겠네 
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	The other drag queens could
		have been covering for him.
		다른 드랙퀸들이 감싸주려 거짓말을
		하는 수도 있어 
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	Well, I find it unlikely
		하이힐을 신고 반짝이 옷에 
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	that a man in heels, sequins,
		and, uh, an elaborate hairstyle
		정교한 가발을 쓴 상태에서 
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	would subdue and handcuff
		another man
		다른 남자를 힘으로 제압하고 수갑을 채워 
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:49	and then set him on fire.
		불까지 지르는 장면은 상상하기 힘든데 
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:50	Oh, no.
		아, 안돼
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	Oh, please don't. Please.
		하지마요, 제발, 어머 어떡해 
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	Then again,
		he's very forceful.
		그런데 한편으론 힘꼴이나 쓰는 남자로군
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:58	Oh, and extremely limber.

00:04:22

00:04:27	He's a local superintendent
		of schools.
		지역 학교 이사라는군요 
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	Uh, well, what do we know
		about the cause of death?
		사인은?
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	Nothing till the autopsy,
		but the coroner found no cause
		검시하기 전까진 모르겠습니다. 
		하지만 산채로 불태워졌다는 
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	to contradict the theory that
		he was burned alive.
		가설을 반박할 증거는 현재까진
		없다고 하네요
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	Then that's
		how we'll proceed.
		지켜보다보면 얘기가 나오겠지
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:36	What was the victim doing
		in that alley?
		골목에서 뭘 하고 있었던걸까요?
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	We don't know.
		모르지
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Uh, the fire was set outside
		a drag queen venue,
		여장 클럽 옆에서 불이 나긴 했지만 
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	but there's
		a dozen businesses
		그 시각에 다른 상점도 
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	that open up
		onto that alley.
		여럿 영업중이었어 
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:44	Archie could have been tied
		to any one of 'em.
		그 중 어떤 곳과 연관이 있을지 몰라 
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Sac P.D. wants to help
		on this one.
		그 점은 새크라멘트 경찰이 도와줄 겁니다 
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	I'll ask them to show
		the victim's photo around.
		피해자의 사진을 상점가에 돌리도록 했어요 
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	One thing I do know
		is we've got
		확실한 건 우리가 처리해야 할 
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	a lot of fingerprints
		to work with--
		엄청나게 많은 지문이 
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:53	on the car, on the gas can.
		자동차랑 석유통에서 나왔다는 거야 
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	They even found a partial
		on the handcuffs.
		지문이 수갑에마저 일부 묻어 있었어
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	I checked the bar code
		on one of those gas cans.
		석유통의 바코드를 조사했습니다 
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:58	It came
		from a local discount store--
		근처 할인매장 제품이더군요 
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	Bargain Emporium.
		"바겐 엠포리움"이라는 곳입니다 
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	You and Rigsby go
		and check it out.
		릭스비랑 가서 확인해봐 
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	All right.
		Okay.
		알겠습니다 
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	I want you and Jane to go

		넌 제인이랑 피해자 아버지를 만나봐 
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	He's gonna want to believe
		his son's alive.
		아직 아들이 어딘가 살아있길 바랄텐데 
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	Careful not to build up
		his hope.
		괜한 소리로 부추겨놓지 말고 
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	All right.
		알겠습니다 
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:18	He's dead, isn't he?
		죽은 거지요?
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	I know he's dead.
		죽었을 겁니다 
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:22	It was his car, right?
		그 애 차였죠?
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	We're still waiting
		for a positive I.D.
		정확한 신원 확인에는 시간이 걸립니다
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:27	But you're moving forward
		on the premise that it was him,
		하지만 시신이 그 애일거라는 가정 하에
		수사하고 있잖습니까
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	am I right?
		내 말이 맞습니까?
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	Yes.
		그렇습니다 
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	Thank you.
		말씀 고맙습니다 
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:39	You don't seem surprised.
		이 소식에 별로 놀라지도 않으시는군요
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	I'm not.
		그럴밖에요 
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	M-my son was a victim
		his whole life.
		힘겨운 인생을 살아온 아이였으니까요 
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	Never a murder victim.
		꼭 살해되란 법은 없죠
00:05:46	 
		 
00:05:46	No, but it was
		my deepest fear...
		하지만 전 늘 아치가 위험한 상황에
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	that Archie would get himself
		into a dangerous situation.
		스스로 뛰어들지나 않을까 걱정해 왔어요 
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	He was a troublemaker?
		사고뭉치였나요?
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Exactly the opposite. He was
		the target of troublemakers.
		정확히 그 반대였습니다. 
		사고뭉치들이 그 애를 노렸죠 
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	Soft, I suppose you could say.
		애가 무른 구석이 있었어요 
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	That's why it was so hard
		asking him to move out.
		그래서 나가랄때 우려도 많았죠 
00:06:03	 
		 
00:06:03	Archie hadn't been
		living here?
		여기 사는게 아닌가요?
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	We had a deal. I would
		provide room and board
		학사 학위를 따면 
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	while he earned
		a college degree,
		생활비를 대주겠다고 약속했죠 
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	but six months ago...
		하지만 6개월 전.. 
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	Archie decided that college
		wasn't his thing.
		그 앤 대학 공부가 자기 길이 아니라고 결심했어요 
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:13	So you invited him to leave?
		그래서 나가라고 하셨나요?
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	It was a teaching moment.
		교훈을 주려고 했죠 
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:19	Painful, but necessary.
		서로에게 힘든 순간이었지만 
		필요한 순간이기도 했어요 
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	How'd your wife feel
		about that?
		아내분은 그에 대해 어떻게 생각하셨나요? 
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	My wife died
		when he was 6 years old.
		아내는 아이가 6살때 죽었습니다 
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	It's been the Archies
		ever since.
		그 후론 두분만 사셨군요 
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	The boy was nothing
		like me.
		그 앤 저와 닮은 데가 없었어요 
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	Why, because he's gay?
		왜요, 자녀분이 게이였으니까요?
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:35	I don't...
		전... 
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:38	Was he?
		그랬나요? 
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	Is that what it says
		in your files?
		경찰 자료에 그렇게 나와 있습니까? 
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:43	We don't keep files
		on gay people.
		저희는 동성애자에 관한 자료를 
		모으지 않습니다 
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	I mean, it's okay
		if he was.
		게이였대도 괜찮아요 
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	I would never judge anyone
		based on such criteria.
		전 그런 잣대로 누군가를 
		판단하거나 하지 않습니다 
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	But if he was,
		하지만 게이였대도 
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	he--he never talked
		to me about it.
		저한텐 한번도 말한 적 없었어요 
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	I have to ask.
		Procedure and all.
		절차라서 할수없이 여쭙겠습니다 
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	Where were you last night
		at 8:45?
		어제 저녁 8시 45분경 어디 계셨죠? 
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	Home alone. Working.
		집에서 혼자 일하고 있었습니다 
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	I'm writing a book
		on educational theory.
		교육이론에 대한 책을 쓰지요 
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	I'd like to take a look
		at your son's bedroom,
		괜찮으시다면 
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	if you don't mind.
		아드님 쓰시던 방을 보고 싶군요 
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	Down the hall
		on your right.
		홀을 통과하셔서 오른쪽입니다 
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:17	How did you know
		Archie was gay?
		아치가 게이라는걸 어떻게 아셨죠? 
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	Well, Archie Sr. named his son
		after himself, like a king.
		아들에게 자기 이름을 물려줬잖아,
		옛날 왕들 하듯이 
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	He was hoping for an heir,
		자기 업적을 계승할 자식을 원했단 말인데 
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	yet there's not one photo
		of junior in the house.
		집 안에 아들 사진이 한 장도 없잖아 
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	You think
		he's ashamed of him.
		아들을 부끄러워했다는 말이군요 
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	I mean,
		well, look at this room.
		이 방만 해도 보라고 
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	Traditional masculine decor.
		전통적인 신사계급의 인테리어 
00:07:34	 
		 
00:07:34	Bold nautical themes.
		선박이며 해양의 테마 
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	It's like a furniture catalog
		threw up in here.
		가구회사 카달로그를 그대로 
		옮겨놓은 것 같네요 
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	Yes.
		그러게 
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	These are not the choices
		of a teenager.
		절대로 십대가 스스로 선택했을리 없지 
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	I think Archie Sr. personally
		decorated this room
		게이 아들을 혼구멍 내주려 
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	in the attempt
		to butch-up his gay son.
		그 아버지가 일부러 만든 방일거야 
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	Should've seen
		my room back home.
		내 방을 보여줘야 하는건데 
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	Posters everywhere.
		포스터로 발라놨거든요 
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	Let me guess. Hanson?
		맞춰볼까, '핸슨'인가? 그 보이밴드?
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	They wrote their own music.
		걔네 엄연한 싱어송라이터예요 
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	Ah. Looks like Archie did hang
		something on the wall.
		아치가 뭔가 벽에 걸어놨던 것 같군
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	I'm guessing that was a photo
		of him and his mother.
		내 생각엔 엄마랑 찍은 사진이었을 거야 
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	What's on his computer?
		컴퓨터에 뭐가 있어? 
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	It's password-protected.
		암호가 걸려 있어요 
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	I'll have to take
		the hard drive back to CBI
		하드를 HQ로 가져가서 
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	and run
		some recovery software.
		복구 프로그램을 돌려야 할 것 같아요 
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	Oh, okay. You do that.
		그러도록 해 
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:33	Thank you for coming.
		와주셔서 감사합니다. 
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	The woman on the phone said
		전화거신 여성분이 
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	that you'd like me to help
		with your investigation.
		저더러 와서 수사를 도와달라고 하시길래 
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	Yes. We need to see
		if your fingerprints match
		사건 현장에서 발견된 지문과 
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	the prints we found
		at the crime scene.
		선생님 지문을 대조하고 싶습니다 
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	Oh, so I'm
		a person of interest?
		어머, 제가 용의자라는 뜻인가요?
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	Ah, you are.
		그렇게 되겠네요 
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	Hmm.
		흐음
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	Can I ask you something?
		한가지 여쭤봐도 될까요?
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Do you always go out
		like this?
		외출할때 항상 이렇게 다니시나요?
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	In drag, I mean.
		그러니까 여장하신 상태로...
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Whenever I get dressed,
		I try to consider
		전 제가 어딜 가는지 또 누굴 만날지
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	where I'm going,
		who I'm going to see,
		또 어떡해야 깊은 인상을 줄 수 있을지 
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	and how I can
		blow them away.
		두루 고려해 옷차림을 결정한답니다 
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	Let me escort you
		to fingerprinting.
		지문감식반까지 바래다드리죠 
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	A police escort.
		How could I refuse?
		경찰 호위라니, 감히 거절할 수가 있나요? 
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:11	We keep the gas cans back here
		on Aisle 12.
		석유통이라면 12번 선반에 갖다 놓는데요
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	Yeah. Here we go.
		여기 있네요 
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	Those are the ones.
		바로 이거야 
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	What kind of crime were
		they used in?
		이게 어떤 사건에 쓰였다는거죠?
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	We can't go
		into the details,
		자세한 것까진 알려드릴 수 없지만
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	but maybe you can
		help us out.
		선생님께서 도와주실수 있을지도 모릅니다 
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	Have you ever seen
		this man in the store?
		가게에서 이 사람을 보신적 있나요?
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Archie? I hope so.
		He works here.
		아치? 물론이죠, 여기서 일하는걸요 
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	What did he do?
		뭘 어쨌길래요?
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	His car was found on fire
		last night.
		이 사람의 차가 어제 불탄채 발견됐습니다 
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	There was a body inside.
		신원 미상 시신이 안에 있었어요 
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	Oh, no. Well, was it--
		아니, 그럼 그게... 
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	We don't know yet.
		How long did Archie work here?
		저희도 아직 모릅니다. 
		아치가 일한지는 얼마나 오래 됐습니까? 
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:40	Uh, a couple months, maybe.
		두세달 정도일걸요 
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	Do you know anyone
		who wanted to hurt him?
		아치를 해칠만한 사람을 아십니까?
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	Yeah.
		네 
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	Rick. Total douche.
		릭이라고 아주 불량배예요 
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	Rick?
		Rick Hughes.
		- 릭? 
		- 릭 휴즈
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	He stocks shelves
		and quotes "Fight Club."
		"파이트 클럽" 영화 팬이에요 
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	He picks on Archie
		all the time.
		아치를 찍어놓고 괴롭혔어요 
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	Last week, Archie had
		bruises all over.
		지난주엔 온통 멍투성이가 됐는데 
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	He wouldn't tell me
		what happened,
		아치가 말은 안했지만 
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	but I'll bet it was Rick.
		분명 릭의 짓이었을 거예요 
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	- Is Rick here now?
		- In the loading bay.
		- 오늘 출근했습니까?
		- 적하장에 있어요 
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	All right.
		알겠습니다 
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	You take it.
		A couple more things.
		선배가 가봐요
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:09	Rick Hughes?
		릭 휴즈?
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	That's right.
		그런데요 
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	Let's talk about
		Archie Bloom.
		아치 블룸에 대해 얘기합시다 
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:16	Who are you, his bodyguard?
		뭐야, 아치 보디가드라도 돼요?
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	Why would
		Archie need a bodyguard?
		아치에게 보디가드가 필요했나? 
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	If you don't know...
		모르시나본데... 
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	CBI.
		CBI다
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	We have reason to believe
		Archie was murdered last night.
		아치 블룸이 어젯밤 살해당했다고
		믿을만한 증거를 가지고 있다 
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	For real? How?
		진짜? 어떻게요?
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	You tell me.
		네게 들어야겠는데 
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	That's what this is about?
		그래서 온 거예요?
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Come on, man. I never laid
		a finger on Archie.
		이봐요, 난 아치에게 손가락 하나 까딱 않았다구 
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	That's not what I heard.
		내가 들은바론 그게 아닌데 
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:37	You heard wrong.
		어디서 잘못 들었겠지 
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:40	Are you trying to say
		you never hassled Archie?
		아치와 전혀 트러블이 없었다는 건가?
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	I always hassled Archie.
		트러블이야 늘 있었죠 
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	So what?
		그래서요?
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	We worked together,
		but I liked him, you know?
		우린 같이 일했고, 난 녀석을 꽤 좋아했어요 
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Every time I'd come across
		defective merchandise back here,
		반품된 물건 처리할때도 
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	I'd give it to him
		as a gift.
		선물로 늘 하나씩 안겨줬다구요 
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	What'd you give him?
		뭘 줬는데? 
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	Stuffed animals. An apron.
		봉제 인형이랑 에이프런? 
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:00	What?
		왜요?
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:05	This was Archie's locker.
		이게 아치 사물함이에요 
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:09	I take it he wasn't the one
		사물함을 이렇게 꾸민게 
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	who added the decorations.
		아치 본인일것 같진 않은데요 
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	No. That would be Rick.
		Textbook homophobe.
		릭이었을 거예요. 전형적인 호모포비아라서 
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	My manager told him to stop,
		but guys like that...
		점장이 그만두라고도 했지만
		남자애들이란 할 수 없죠
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	Well, if it was so bad,
		why didn't Archie just quit?
		그런데도 왜 아치는 그만두지 않았죠? 
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	He said it wasn't any different
		at his last job.
		지난 직장에서도 별 차이 없었대요 
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	He wanted to learn how
		to handle it better.
		어떻게든 잘 적응하는 법을
		배우고 싶댔어요 
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	I gotta go back
		to the register.
		일하러 돌아가야겠네요 
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:33	Shut the locker
		when you're done.
		일 끝나시면 사물함은 닫아 주세요 
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	Sure. Thank you.
		그러죠, 고맙습니다 
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:58	 
		 
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:03	Rigsby.
		릭스비입니다 
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	Hey, it's Lisbon.
		The dental records came back.
		나야, 치과기록이 도착했어 
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	The body inside the car has been
		confirmed as Archie Bloom.
		시신은 아치 블룸으로 확인됐어 
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	Oh, that's too bad.
		그것 참... 
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	His father gave us an address
		where he was renting.
		아버지한테서 아치가 지내던 주소를 받았어 
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	Yeah, if you don't mind,
		I'll get Cho to check it out.
		괜찮으시면 선배를 대신 보낼게요 
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	Archie worked in the store here,
		and I think I found a lead
		아치가 일하던 직장에 왔는데 
		실마리를 발견한 것 같아요 
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	that I want to run down
		at the office.
		- 사무실로 바로 가지고 들어가려구요 
		- 알았어 
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	Okay
		네 
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:27	Looks like the whole roll
		was taken.
		필름 전부 현상해야 할 것 같아요 
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Call me as soon
		as you process the film.
		작업 끝나는대로 바로 연락주세요 
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	Thank you.
		감사합니다 
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:39	U-um...
		어...
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	After you.
		먼저 쓰세요 
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:43	Such a gentleman.
		참으로 신사시군요 
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:52	Well, Glennda's prints don't
		match any of the prints
		글린다 지문은 현장에서 발견된
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	at the crime scene,
		그 어떤 지문과도 일치하지 않았어 
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	and I did background checks
		on the drag queens.
		그 드랙퀸들 신원 조사도 다 해봤는데 
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	None of them stand out.
		이렇다할 불거지는 건 눈에 안 보이더라고 
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Oh, don't let them hear you
		say that.
		어이쿠, 그 사람들 들으면 섹드립인줄 알라 
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	Hey, you guys.
		저기요 
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	I found some videos
		on Archie's hard drive.
		아치 컴퓨터에서 동영상을 찾았어요 
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	They're inside
		a hidden partition.
		파티션을 나눠놓고 숨겨놨더라구요 
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	Looks like Archie didn't want
		prying eyes to see.
		남한테 보이고 싶지 않았던 모양이에요 
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	You found something?
		뭔가 있나보지? 
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:11	Can you play the files?
		재생할 수 있어?
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	I think so.
		아마도요 
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:21	Nice guy.
		좋은 사람이더라구요 
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	So it seems.
		나한테도 그래보여 
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	Okay. Got it. Uh...
		됐네요 
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Most of these files look
		like they were created
		이 파일들 녹화된 날짜는 
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	two or three years ago,
		when Archie was in high school.
		거의가 2,3년전 아치가 고등학생 때예요 
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:33	No, I am done asking!
		방으로 들어가라고
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	Into your room.
		Aah.
		지시했잖니!
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	Sit. Sit in that chair.
		I said, "sit down!"
		의자에 앉아, 앉으라고!
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	Let go.
		 
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	Now you are gonna do
		exactly as I tell you.
		이제 정확히 내가 시키는대로 해
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:43	You put your left arm
		on the chair.
		왼팔을 팔걸이에 놓아라
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	Aah. You're hurting me.
		아프잖아요
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	Stop whining!
		징징거리지 마!
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Are you kidding? Handcuffs?
		미친거 아냐? 수갑이 왜 나와?
00:13:49	 
		 
00:13:49	Just do it.
		Now you are gonna...
		 
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	- Latest educational tool.
		- Stop!
		최신 교육 교재인가 보네 
		그만두세요!
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	Sit here all night long
		until your homework is done.
		숙제가 끝날때까지 절대 일어나지 마라
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	Maybe this will
		toughen you up.
		이렇게라도 해야 사람꼴을 하겠지
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	Wait. Pause the video.
		Those are hinged handcuffs,
		잠깐 멈춰봐, 저 경첩식 수갑 
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	just like the ones used
		in the victim's murder.
		사건현장에 있던 거랑 같은 종류야 
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	I'm guessing this wasn't
		the first daddy dearest routine.
		친아버지 소행으로 치부하긴 좀 그렇군
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	Archie had that camera
		set up and recording
		아치는 방으로 쫓겨들어오기 전에 
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	before they walked
		into the room.
		미리 카메라를 설치해놨어 
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	Play it further.
		마저 틀어봐 
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:18	Somebody... help me.
		제발 아무나 좀 도와주세요
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:29	Tactical handcuffs,
		dual-hinged,
		쌍 경첩식 수갑
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	the same make you used
		to chain your son to his desk.
		아드님을 책상 앞에 묶어두실때 
		썼던 것과 같은 종류죠 
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:34	What are you talking
		about?
		무슨 말씀 하시는 겁니까?
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	Archie secretly videotaped it.
		We found it on his computer.
		아치가 몰래 카메라를 설치했었어요.
		저희가 컴퓨터에서 영상을 찾았습니다
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:42	You don't understand
		what you were watching.
		뭘 보셨는지 오해하신겁니다 
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	Enlighten us.
		오해를 풀어주시든가요 
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	The relationship
		between completed homework
		숙제를 마치는 것과 학업 성취도는
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	and academic achievement
		is statistically compelling.
		통계적으로 유의미한 상관관계를 갖습니다 
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	With Archie,
		aggressive techniques
		아치에게는 강압적인 수단이 
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	were necessary
		to keep him motivated.
		아이의 동기유발을 위해 적절했어요 
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	Oh, you motivated him,
		all right,
		하셨죠, 그 유발 
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	right out of college.
		바로 대학을 때려치게 하셨죠 
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	That was his failure,
		not mine.
		그건 아이 잘못이지 제탓이 아닙니다 
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	A dropout for a son doesn't look
		good on the Wikipedia page
		이른바 교육학계 거물한테 
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:01	of a wannabe educational giant,
		does it?
		아드님의 자퇴는 보기 좋지 않았겠죠?
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Is that why you killed him?
		그래서 죽인 것 아닙니까?
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	My own son?
		친아들을요?
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	Because the cuffs happen
		to look like mine?
		수갑 따위가 좀 닮았다는 이유로? 
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	We found your fingerprints
		on 'em.
		지문도 찾아냈습니다 
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	That's impossible.
		말도 안돼요 
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	Unless...
		그건 아마도 
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:18	I suppose that someone could
		have stolen them from my office.
		누군가 제 지문을 사무실에서 훔쳐간 겁니다 
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:21	You're gonna take
		that route?
		이런 식으로 나오실 겁니까?
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	I know how that sounds.
		제 말이 어떻게 들리는줄은 압니다 
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:24	You know, you should consider
		a lie detector test.
		거짓말 탐지기를 쓰는건 어떻겠습니까 
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	It'll clear all this up.
		이러쿵저러쿵 할 것 없이요 
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	Happily.
		기꺼이 그러죠 
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	Give me your hand.
		손 주세요 
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	Excuse me?
		뭐라구요?
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	You said, "happily""
		기꺼이 하시겠다며요 
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:36	okay, just a couple
		of irrelevant questions
		좋습니다 기초 반응을 보기 위해 
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	to establish a baseline.
		몇가지 사건과 무관한 질문을 하죠 
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	What's your name?
		성함은?
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	- Archie Bloom.
		- You love your son?
		- 아치 블룸
		- 아들을 사랑하십니까?
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Yes.
		그렇습니다
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	Were you ashamed of him?
		아들이 부끄러우십니까?
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:49	It's an irrelevant question.
		I already know the answer.
		사건과 무관한 질문이며 전 이미 
		그 답도 알고 있습니다 
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	The truth, please.
		진실만을 말하세요 
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	Were you ashamed
		of your son?
		아들이 부끄러우십니까?
00:15:57	 
		 
00:16:00	Yes.
		네
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:05	Did you kill him?
		아들을 죽였습니까?
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:08	No.
		아뇨
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	No, I didn't.
		죽이지 않았습니다 
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:15	So do you think
		he killed the victim?
		아버지가 범인이라 생각해? 
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	He did, well, at least
		he feels like he did.
		응, 뭐...최소한 거의 본인이 
		죽인거나 같은 느낌을 가지고 있어 
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	Hard to be certain.
		단언하기 어렵군
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	Guilt comes in many forms.
		다양한 방식으로 죄책감이 느껴져 
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	That's the best you can do?
		할 말은 그게 다야?
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	For now.
		지금까지는 
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	Mm.
		 
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	- Wh-what?
		- Are you wearing perfume?
		- 왜?
		- 향수통에 빠졌다 나오기라도 한거야?
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	Right.
		그랬지 
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	Well, you've been standing
		close to someone that is.
		아니면 그런 사람 옆에 있었구나 
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	Uh, that would be Glennda.
		She's very fragrant.
		아마 글린다였을거야. 그 여자 어찌나 진한지 
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	You just called Glennda
		"she."
		방금 '여자'랬어
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	So?
		그래서? 
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	You didn't before.
		I have to go.
		전엔 안 그랬잖아, 가봐야겠다 
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	Where?
		어딜?
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	I just had a thoughtless impulse
		or an inspired hunch.
		영감이 몇개 뇌리를 스치고 지나갔어 
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	I'm not sure which yet.
		I'll let you know.
		뭐라고 당장 얘기해 줄 순 없고, 나중에 
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:56	How ya doin'?
		장사는 잘 됩니까?
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	Agent Cho. CBI.
		CBI의 조요원입니다 
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Well, you're not here
		to buy a book. Who died?
		책 사러 오신건 아니겠고, 누가 죽었습니까?
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	Archie Bloom.
		아치 블룸
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:07	"Something good will come
		of all things yet."
		"하필이면 쭉정이 가운데 드문 알곡 같았던."
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:11	How did Archie die?
		아치가 어쩌다 죽었죠?
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	Homicide.
		살해당했습니다 
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	His father gave us this address
		as his last known residence.
		그애 아버지가 아치 주소라고 
		여길 얘기하더군요 
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	My apartment's upstairs.
		제 아파트 윗층입니다 
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	I rent out my spare room to help
		cover my lease.
		임대료에 보태려 세를 놓았죠 
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	Hard to remain
		a viable literary watering hole
		저항문화가 인터넷에 공짜로 퍼져있는 시대에
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:27	when the counterculture
		is free online.
		서점으로 먹고살기란 쉽지 않으니까요 
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	Tell me about your relationship
		with the victim.
		피해자와의 관계를 말씀해 주시죠 
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	Sacramento is a place
		of wide lawns and narrow minds.
		새크라멘토는 너른 잔디밭만 가꿀줄 알지
		마음은 가꿀줄 모르는 사람들로 가득하죠 
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Archie came here
		to nourish his soul.
		아치는 영혼을 살찌우기 위해 
		이곳을 찾았습니다 
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	When he mentioned
		his father kicked him out,
		아버지로부터 쫓겨났다는 말을 듣자 
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	I was only too happy
		to rent him a room.
		방을 세줄 수 있어 기뻤지요 
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	When was the last time
		you saw him?
		아치를 마지막으로 보신 건 언제입니까?
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	I haven't seen Archie
		in a week.
		본지 일주일 정도 됐군요 
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	He cleared out
		without leaving a note
		지난달 방세를 밀린채 
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	or his last month's rent.
		말도 없이 떠났어요 
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	Any idea why?
		왜 그랬을까요?
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	Was he in trouble?
		사건에라도 휘말린 겁니까? 
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	"I have nothing to offer anybody
		but my own confusion."
		"내 자신의 혼란 외에는 나눌 것이 없었으니."
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:59	Kerouac.
		잭 케루악...
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	No. Kesey.
		Influenced by Kerouac.
		켄 키지예요, 케루악의 영향을 받았죠 
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	Common mistake.
		많이들 헷갈려 하십니다 
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	No. You.
		아뇨, 당신 말입니다 
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	You keep quoting Kerouac,
		an overrated bum.
		케루악을 인용하는 건 그만하면 됐습니다 
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	I need you to answer
		my questions in your own words.
		당신 언어로 진술해 주십시오 
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	Where were you
		last night at 8:45?
		어젯밤 8시 45분에 뭘 하고 계셨습니까? 
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:17	Hey. We caught a break.
		하나 건졌어요 
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	On the father?
		아버지?
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	On the co-worker.
		Rick Hughes.
		직장 동료 릭 휴즈요 
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	He's 22. He was seen harassing
		Archie Bloom at work.
		22살이고 직장에서 아치를 계속
		괴롭혀왔어요 
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	He's got two strikes
		for larceny,
		절도 전과 2범이고 
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	and check this out--
		I found a disposable camera
		그리고 아치 사물함에서 발견한 
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	in Archie's locker
		and had the film developed.
		일회용 카메라를 현상했더니 
		이런게 나왔어요 
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	What was he stealing,
		baby formula?
		뭘 훔치는거야, 애기 이유식?
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	Yeah, it's a staple
		in retail theft gangs,
		소매점 터는 녀석들에게는 인기 품목이에요
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	always in demand
		and way overpriced.
		늘 수요가 있고 말도 안되게 비싸거든요 
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	Trust me. I know.
		제가 요새 좀 알게 됐죠 
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	If Archie was taking
		surveillance photos,
		아치가 증거 사진을 찍었다면 
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	he must've been planning
		on exposing Hughes.
		휴즈에게 경고할 계획이 있었겠지 
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	A third strike would put Hughes
		away for a long time.
		3범이면 가중처벌을 당할테니까 
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	Well, that's a motive
		for murder.
		그게 살인 동기일 수 있어요 
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	Okay, bring him in,
		but I'm gonna hold on
		좋아, 놈을 데려와 
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	to the kid's dad
		for as long as I can.
		하지만 애 아버지도 가능한한
		오래 붙들고 있어야겠어 
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	Okay.
		알겠습니다 
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:56	Uh, sorry to interrupt.
		방해해서 죄송합니다 
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	The funeral director told me
		I'd find you back here.
		책임자분께서 그쪽을 찾으려면
		여기 가보라 하시더군요 
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:04	Hello, Glennda.
		안녕하세요 글린다씨 
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:09	Peeking behind the curtain.
		커튼 사이로 엿볼땐 조심하세요 
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	Careful you don't lose
		your illusions.
		환상을 잃어버릴지 모르니 
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	Well, it's a little late
		for that...
		조심하기엔 좀 늦었네요 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Let me tell you.
		이렇게 되어 버렸습니다 
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	They prefer
		I go by "Glenn" here
		사람들은 제가 글렌으로 통하고 
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	and act like Glenn.
		글렌으로 행세하는 걸 더 좋아해요 
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	A funeral cosmetologist.
		장례식장의 미용사라 
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Well, that makes sense.
		말이 되네요 
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	Even a diva needs a day job.
		무대 위의 디바라도 생계를 꾸려야지요 
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:29	I've always loved makeup,
		but, uh, wearing it
		전 화장하는게 늘 좋았어요 
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	wasn't an option
		for a boy in Sacramento,
		하지만 새크라멘토에서는
		남자에게 그런걸 허락지 않죠 
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	so I chose a career
		in death care.
		그래서 차라리 이런 직업을 택한거죠 
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	What brings you
		to my laboratory?
		여기 오신 이유가 뭐죠?
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	I wanted to know why you lied
		to me about the crime scene.
		사건 현장에 대해 왜 거짓말을 하셨는지
		궁금해서 왔습니다 
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	And what makes you think
		I lied?
		왜 제가 거짓말을 했다고 생각하시죠?
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	Well, I-I didn't at first.
		처음엔 의심하지 않았어요 
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	Uh, I cold-read you
		as a man.
		당신을 남자라 생각하고 콜드리딩 했거든요 
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	I thought
		your theatrical mannerisms
		당신의 연극적인 행동거지를
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	were part of the character
		you played.
		그저 당신 쇼의 일부라고 생각했죠 
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	I underestimated the extent
		of your transformation.
		당신의 변신을 얕잡아봤나 봅니다 
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	3 hours of makeup
		and a $4,000 dress
		세시간짜리 화장과 
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	has that effect.
		4천달러짜리 드레스는 그 값을 하죠 
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	You become someone else.
		완전히 다른 사람이 될 수 있거든요 
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	You become... a woman.
		여자가...될 수 있는겁니다 
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	Mm, and women often act out
		a part,
		여자들은 연기에 재능이 있죠 
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	uh, in the midst of deceit.
		제대로 거짓말을 하고자 하면 
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	They can be emotional or coy
		or... seductive.
		실제보다 감정적이거나, 내숭을 떨거나
		혹은 유혹적일수도 있어요 
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	And I thought I had
		gender issues.
		그쪽도 여자 문제가 있군요 
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	This is your last chance.
		당신께 드리는 마지막 기회입니다 
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	I want the truth,
		or I call my police friends,
		나는 진실을 듣고 싶습니다.
		혹은 내 경찰 친구를 부를 수도 있습니다 
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	and they'll lock you up.
		감옥 갈 수도 있어요 
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	Glenn and Glennda--
		both be out of work.
		글렌이건 글린다건 굉장히
		곤란해지는 겁니다 
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	What'd you see
		in that alley?
		골목에서 본게 뭡니까? 
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:41	A man holding a red gas can,
		pouring it over a car.
		빨간 석유통을 든 남자가 차에다
		기름을 들이붓고 있었어요 
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	Was there anyone
		inside the car?
		그때 차 안에 누가 있었나요?
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	I don't know. It was dark.
		어두웠기 때문에 모르겠습니다 
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	And what did this man
		look like?
		남자가 어떻게 생겼었죠?
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	Like I said, it was dark.
		어두웠다니까요 
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	You're playing dumb again.
		또 멍청한 척 하시는군요 
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	I am not playing.
		I am scared.
		무슨 척이 아닙니다, 난 두려운 거예요 
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	I have been a target
		my whole life.
		난 내 평생 누군가의 증오의 대상이었습니다 
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:04	I'm not gonna make myself
		a target
		난 미치광이 살인자에게 
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	for a killer.
		타겟이 되고 싶지 않아요 
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:12	Did you know
		that Archie was on to you?
		아치가 절도 사실을 눈치챈줄
		알고 있었나?
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:15	Yeah.
		네
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:16	When did he find out?
		아치가 안 건 언제지?
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	Last week.
		We were off-loading boxes,
		지난주요. 짐을 싣고 있는데 
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	and I heard something
		by the dumpster.
		박스더미에서 무슨 소리가 났어요 
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	I looked inside, and it was
		the little princess.
		들춰보니 꼬마 공주님이 계셨죠 
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:25	And what was he doing?
		아치는 뭘 하고 있었지?
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:26	Dumpster diving.
		박스더미를 뒤지는 중이랬어요 
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	Okay. For what?
		그래, 왜?
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	We throw away a lot
		of junk--
		매장에선 쓰레기가 엄청 나와요 
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	you know, busted chairs,
		old magazines, dead plants.
		부서진 의자나 낡은 잡지, 죽은 화분 따위
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	Archie said something about
		needing to furnish his new room.
		집에 가져갈 고물이 없는지 찾는 중이랬어요 
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	And that's
		when you assaulted him
		그래서 절도 사실을 신고하지 못하게 
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	so he wouldn't be able
		to call the cops on you?
		그때 손을 본 건가?
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	I'll tell you
		the same thing
		당신 동료한테도 
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	I told your cop buddy.
		똑같이 말했지만
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	I never laid a finger
		on Archie!
		아치한텐 손가락 하나 까딱하지 않았다구요!
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	Although I did lock him
		in that dumpster
		물론 쓰레기장에 
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	for a couple of hours.
		몇시간 가둬놓긴 했지만
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	What?
		뭐요?
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:51	Where were you
		at 8:45 last night?
		어제 저녁 8시 45분경 어디 있었지?
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	In bed. I'm in bed
		every night by that time.
		자고 있었어요. 항상 그때면 자요 
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:55	I work the 4:00 a.m. shift.
		새벽 4시 출근이니까 
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	So in other words,
		you have no alibi.
		달리 말하면 알리바이가 없다는 뜻이군
00:21:59	 
		 
00:21:59	No alibi,
		and your prints were found
		알리바이는 없는데 
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	on the gas cans
		at the murder scene...
		사건 현장의 석유통에선 네 지문이 나왔어 
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	Hey, wait a minute now.
		이봐요 
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	The gas cans that poured
		accelerant onto the vehicle
		아치 블룸이 산채로 타죽은 
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	in which Archie Bloom
		was burned alive.
		차에 뿌려진 그 석유 말야 
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	Of course my fingerprints
		were on those cans.
		당연히 석유통에 내 지문이 있을 밖에 
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	I personally stocked them
		on the shelf!
		가게서 그 석유캔을 들어 옮긴게 나란 말야! 
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	Or maybe you stole 'em,
		like you stole this merchandise,
		아니면 다른 물건처럼 네가 훔쳤거나 
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	and you killed Archie
		to avoid a third strike
		절도죄로 25년형을 살게 되기 전에 
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:14	and a mandatory 25 years.
		아치를 죽여 입막음했겠지 
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	That's it! I want a lawyer!
		웃기시네! 변호사 불러! 
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	Hey! Sit down!
		앉아!
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	You hear me?!
		A little help!
		사람 말 안 들려?
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	I want a lawyer!
		변호사 불러 달라고!
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	What do you think?
		어떻게 생각해? 
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	Well, all cruelty stems
		from weakness,
		잔인함의 뿌리는 나약함이게 마련이지 
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	and this one's
		a quivering mess--
		저 발광중인 친구 경우엔 
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:26	emotionally immature,
		aggressively masculine.
		감정적으로 미숙하고
		남성 특유의 공격성을 드러내고 있군 
00:22:30	 
		 
00:22:30	He harbors childhood pain
		침대에 오줌을 지렸거나 그 비슷한
		유년기의 수치스런 경험에 
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	tied to bed-wetting
		or some similar humiliation.
		오랫동안 사로잡혀 있어 
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	Yeah, he could be
		our killer, too.
		우리 살인자일 가능성도 물론 있지 
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	You're not making
		this easy.
		일 이렇게 대충대충 할래
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:55	Hey, Summer.
		서머
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	Kimball, I need your help.
		킴벌, 도와줘요 
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	How fast can you make it
		to Glenbrook Park?
		글렌브룩 공원으로 당장 와줄 수 있어요?
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	It depends.
		Is something wrong?
		상황 봐서요. 무슨 문제가 있습니까?
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	Yes! It's a matter
		of life and death.
		완전 목숨 걸린 문제예요 
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:05	What's going on?
		Who's in danger?
		무슨 일입니까? 누가 위험합니까?
00:23:07	 
		 
00:23:07	The puppies!
		There's this pet agency,
		강아지요! 유기견 단체가 있는데 
00:23:09	 
		 
00:23:09	and--and--and, oh,
		I-it's so sad,
		음, 너무 슬퍼 
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	a tragedy,
		these, uh, poor animals.
		비극이야, 가엾어 죽겠어요 
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:14	I mean, we are so lucky
		to have homes.
		우리는 살 집이 있어 무지 다행인거 같아 
00:23:16	 
		 
00:23:16	Can we talk about
		this later?
		이 얘기 나중에 해도 됩니까?
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	No! No, they're about
		to pick up,
		아뇨 아뇨! 강아지를 분양하고 있는데 
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	and I need to pick out
		a puppy for you.
		당신 주려고 한마리 데려갈 거예요 
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	Here.
		Can I have this one, please?
		요 녀석으로 주실래요?
00:23:23	 
		 
00:23:23	No, no. I don't--
		I don't want a dog.
		아뇨, 아뇨, 안돼...난 개 싫습니다 
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	- Ohh!
		- But you will
		으으응! 하지만 이 불독을 보면 
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:27	when you see this pug.
		No, I won't.
		- 당신 생각도 바뀔거....
		- 그렇지 않습니다 
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	He's just like you, Kimball.
		He's all fierce on the outside
		딱 당신같이 생겼어요, 킴벌. 
		겉으론 엄청 으르렁거리지만 
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	and, like, a softy
		on the inside,
		속마음은 상냥하고 
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	and he's got
		this really squishy little face.
		얼굴도 무지 말랑말랑거리고 
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	No, I gotta go. I gotta go.
		아뇨, 끊어야겠어요. 끊겠습니다 
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:40	Whoa! Wait. Hey.
		How about lunch?
		아아! 잠깐, 점심 같이 먹어요 
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	I'm working a case.
		수사 중입니다 
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	Oh, that's perfect.
		그거 잘됐다 
00:23:45	 
		 
00:23:45	We'll have something
		to talk about.
		마침 당신한테 얘기할것도 있고 
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:46	No, I have to find out
		where our victim was living.
		피해자 살던 집 가는 중입니다 
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	I don't have time.
		아주 바빠요 
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:49	Oh, come on, Kimball.
		You have to eat.
		그러지 마요, 킴벌. 밥은 먹어가며 일해야지 
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	I'll spring for lunch.
		점심 내가 살게요 
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	You guys owe me
		a paycheck anyways.
		암튼 CBI에서 나한테 월급 줄 것도 있으니까 
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	Look, I gotta go.
		I'll see you tonight.
		미안한데 끊어야겠어요. 저녁에 봅시다 
00:23:56	 
		 
00:23:56	Uh, n-no dogs.
		개, 개는 안돼요 
00:23:58	 
		 
00:24:00	But I want one.
		하지만 난 얘가 좋은걸 
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:03	The victim's last known address
		is 2 miles away.
		피해자의 마지막 거주지는 여기서 
		2마일 떨어진 곳입니다 
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:05	As far as we know,
		he has no friends,
		저희가 아는 바로는 다른 친구도 없습니다 
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:08	and he was one step away
		from being homeless.
		거의 노숙자 신세였지요 
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:10	Now I've been hitting
		halfway houses all day.
		피해자가 지냈을만한 
00:24:13	 
		 
00:24:13	Looking for a place
		he might have crashed.
		사회복지시설은 거의 다 뒤져봤습니다 
00:24:16	 
		 
00:24:16	You're my last hope.
		남은 곳은 여기가 유일합니다 
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:19	And your best one.
		와주셔서 감사합니다 
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	You know him?
		피해자를 아십니까?
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:22	It's Archie Bloom.
		아치 블룸 말이죠 
00:24:25	 
		 
00:24:25	You, uh...
		방금... 
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	You said he was murdered?
		살해당했다고 하셨나요?
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:30	Yeah.
		네 
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:33	Take a minute.
		바로 대답 않으셔도 됩니다 
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:38	It's okay. Um...
		괜찮아요... 
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:43	Let me show you his room.
		아치가 지내던 방을 보여 드릴게요 
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:50	My name's Kelly.
		I'm a counselor here.
		전 여기 카운셀러 켈리예요 
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:53	I was assigned to Archie
		when he came to us last week.
		지난주 아치가 처음 왔을때 
		제가 등록해 줬어요 
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	Would that be
		when he left the bookstore
		그게 아치가 세들어 살던 서점에서 
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	where he was renting?
		나온 때였습니까?
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	Is that what Gabriel
		told you?
		가브리엘이 그렇게 말하던가요?
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	Archie was renting a room?
		자기가 세를 줬다고?
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	That's right.
		그렇습니다 
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	Gabriel took in the boy
		가브리엘은 그 아이한테 반했기 때문에 
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:07	because he was in love
		with him,
		방을 준 거예요 
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	only Gabriel's form of love
		그 사랑의 방식이 늘상 
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	involved bouts
		of meth and violence.
		마약과 폭력 투성이였으니 문제지 
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:14	Here's his bed.
		이게 아치가 쓰던 침대예요 
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:22	Did Archie tell you
		why he came here?
		왜 여기 왔다고 말하던가요?
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	He didn't want to come.
		아치는 여기 오고 싶어하지 않았어요 
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	He wanted to work it out
		with Gabriel.
		가브리엘과 화해하고 싶어했어요 
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:29	Archie felt rejected
		by his father,
		아치는 아버지에게 의절당한 터라 
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	so the acceptance
		of an older male meant
		나이 많은 남자 어른과 원만한 
		관계를 갖는 게 
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	a lot to him.
		그 애에겐 중요했지요 
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:34	But Gabriel was a predator.
		하지만 가브리엘은 폭력적인 사람이었고 
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	That's how Archie got
		the bruises.
		그래서 멍투성이가 된 거로군 
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:38	It was
		an abusive relationship.
		학대를 일삼았어요 
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:41	It took a lot of courage,
		무진 용기가 필요한 일이었는데요 
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:43	but Archie left everything
		아치는 가브리엘 집에 모든걸 놔두고 
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:45	at Gabriel's to join us.
		몸만 나와 여기로 왔죠 
00:25:47	 
		 
00:25:47	- Excuse me.
		- Sure.
		- 실례합니다 
		- 물론입니다 
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:52	Hey, guys, enough.
		 
00:25:54	 
		 
00:25:57	 
		 
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:24	My client Mr. Bloom
		has connections,
		블룸씨는 여기저기 끈이 닿아요 
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	and if you don't
		let him go,
		계속 붙잡아 두신다면 
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:27	the next call you get
		will be from the mayor.
		시장 직통 전화를 받게 될 겁니다 
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	I'm sorry, but there are no special privileges.
		끈 좀 닿는다고 뭐가 되는게 아닙니다 
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:31	Your client is a murder suspect.
		당신 고객은 살인 용의자예요 
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	Well--
		attorney for Rick Hughes.
		릭 휴즈 변호인입니다 
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	I'd like to talk
		to my client, please!
		의뢰인과 당장 얘기해야겠습니다!
00:26:38	 
		 
00:26:38	Hold on.
		잠시만요 
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	Cho. Cho, help me out.
		조, 나 좀 도와줘 
00:26:41	 
		 
00:26:41	I am desperate here.
		여기 완전 헬게이트야 
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	I got a lead.
		실마리를 찾았습니다 
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:44	Which one?
		The dad or the co-worker?
		어느쪽? 애 아버지 아니면 직장 동료?
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	- The lover.
		- What lover?
		- 애인입니다 
		- 왠 애인? 
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	- He's a new suspect.
		- Great. Just what I need.
		- 새 용의자입니다 
		- 이 마당에 새 용의자 좋지 
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:50	Who was that and what'd they say?
		도대체 무슨 전d니까?
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Now w-will you t--let me--
		take me to my client already?
		내 의뢰인과 만나게 해 줄겁니까?
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:52	It's a huge mistake
		to inconvenience my client...
		내 의뢰인을 이렇게 대우하면 
		끝이 안 좋을겁니다 
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:53	Do you realize how long...
		얼마나 오래 끌 겁니까? 
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	Any more than you already have...
		I've been waiting for, huh?
		대체 시간을 얼마나 더 잡아먹을 겁니까?
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	You're sitting there
		looking at me like that.
		거기 앉아 멀뚱멀뚱 쳐다만 볼 겁니까?
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	Not to mention my time, which is--
		would you please do--
		사람 시간은 시간도 아니다 이거예요? 
00:26:58	 
		 
00:27:01	All the great ones had some form
		of addiction, hmm?
		모든 위대성은 일종의 중독을 품고 있어 
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	Kerouac's romance was
		with benzedrine.
		케루악의 로맨스는 암페타민의 산물이야 
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	"On the Road" would never have
		been written without it.
		"On the Road"는 암페타민 없이는
		불가능한 작품이었지 
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	Oh, it's the literary detective.
		I had a feeling you'd be back.
		우리 문학 형사님. 안 그래도 
		돌아오실 것 같았소이다 
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:13	Looking for new roommates,
		Gabriel?
		새 세입자를 받았나보죠?
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:16	Something like that.
		그 비슷하지요 
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	You three, out.
		여기 세명, 나가십시오 
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	Okay.
		알겠습니다 
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:23	We have a warrant
		to search your shop
		서점과 윗층을 수색할 
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	and the apartment upstairs.
		영장을 가지고 왔습니다 
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	What are you looking for?
		뭘 찾으시려는 거죠?
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:27	Evidence linking you
		to the murder of Archie Bloom.
		아치 블룸 피살과 당신을 연결지을 증거죠 
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	Why would I kill Archie?
		내가 왜 아치를 죽입니까?
00:27:31	 
		 
00:27:31	We read his journal.
		We know all about it--
		아치 일기를 입수했습니다 
00:27:33	 
		 
00:27:33	the physical and sexual abuse
		driven by substance abuse.
		약물과용으로 말미암은
		신체적, 성적 학대에 관해 알고 왔습니다 
00:27:35	 
		 
00:27:35	Crystal meth, to be exact.
		정확히 말해 필로폰 말입니다만
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:37	Archie's journal was
		a writing project.
		아치의 일기장은 습작이었어요 
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	It was a pure work
		of fiction.
		그건 모두 픽션입니다 
00:27:40	 
		 
00:27:40	Funny. That's not
		what he told his counselor
		재밌군요, 왜냐면 아치는 
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	at the halfway house.
		사회복지시설에 그렇게 말하지 않았거든요 
00:27:42	 
		 
00:27:42	Take off your jacket.
		웃도리 벗으십쇼 
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	All right. There's a limit.
		이건 정말 참기 힘들군요 
00:27:46	 
		 
00:27:46	Fine. Keep your jacket on.
		좋습니다, 웃도리는 벗지 않아도 됩니다 
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	Put your hands on your head
		so I can search you.
		수색할 수 있도록 두 손을 머리 위로 올리세요 
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	No, you're not.
		웃기지 마시죠 
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	Ow!
		 
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	In Archie's fictional journal,
		the bad guy kept
		아치의 소설 습작을 보면 
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	something interesting
		inside his jacket.
		악당이 웃저고리 주머니에 
		흥미로운 걸 숨기고 있다고 하죠 
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Ohh.
		 
00:27:59	 
		 
00:27:59	Crystal meth.
		필로폰 
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	Uh, o-okay. Okay. Okay.
		알았어요, 알았어 
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	Yeah, for all
		your high-minded talk,
		하는 말은 꽤나 번드르르했지만 
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	you're nothing but a predator
		and a drug addict.
		결국엔 약물 중독 개새끼에 불과했군요 
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:07	That boy was barely
		an adult.
		아치 블룸은 갓 성년이 지난 나이였어 
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	And when he threated to tell
		the police,
		아치가 경찰에 신고하겠다 말하자 
00:28:10	 
		 
00:28:10	you killed him, just like
		the journal said you would.
		아치가 일기에서 예상했던 것처럼
		당신이 아치를 죽였겠지 
00:28:13	 
		 
00:28:13	I did not. I--ohh.
		난 그러지 않았...악!
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:17	Are you planning on joining
		this investigation?
		우리 수사에 참여할 생각은 있는지?
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:20	Because we could really use
		your help.
		왜냐면 네 도움이 절실하거든 
00:28:21	 
		 
00:28:21	I'm weighing evidence
		in my head.
		머릿속에서 증거를 이리저리 재는 중이야
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:23	Where do you want to put this one?
		어디로 데려갈까요?
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:25	Interrogation rooms one
		and two are in use.
		심문실 1,2번은 사용중이야 
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	I'll put him in three.
		3번으로 데려가죠 
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:28	That's it.
		Our stables are full.
		우린 완전 만실이야 
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:30	We get any more suspects,
		여기서 용의자가 하나라도 더 생기면 
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	we're gonna have to convert
		the janitor's closet.
		청소 도구실까지 빌려야할 판이야 
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	This is
		Gabriel Lamb's defense attorney.
		가브리엘 램의 변호사가 왔습니다 
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	Where's my client?
		제 의뢰인은 어딨죠?
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:36	Lawyers in my office.
		I'll be with you shortly.
		제 사무실로 먼저 가 주시죠, 
		곧 뵙겠습니다 
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:38	Did you get anything
		at the bookstore?
		서점에서 찾아낸 건 없어?
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:40	Crystal meth.
		Some on the suspect
		필로폰이 나왔습니다 
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	and 40 grams in his apartment.
		Looks like he was dealing.
		용의자 수중에서 일부, 아파트에서 40그람.
		거래상이었던 것 같습니다 
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	I don't get it.
		어이가 없군 
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:45	We've got
		three prime murder suspects,
		살인 용의자가 셋이나 있는데 
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:46	all of whom are guilty
		of other crimes.
		셋다 별개 혐의를 주렁주렁 달고 있다니 
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	Well, thanks to the evidence
		you were provided.
		다 하늘에서 떨어진 증거 덕이지 뭐야 
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	Uncovered, not provided.
		떨어지긴 뭘 떨어져, 밝혀낸거지 
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	Semantics.
		말이 그렇다는거지 
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:53	Our best hope to nail the killer
		is to leverage our evidence
		용의자를 구류해둔 사이에 
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:55	while they're still
		in holding,
		증거를 보완해 기소하지 못하면 
		우린 끝장이야 
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	but which suspect do we
		go after first?
		하지만 누구 먼저 조져야해? 
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	Well, you have three
		neatly packaged possibilities.
		우리 앞엔 잘 포장된 가능성이 셋이나 있어 
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:01	Uh, the only way to know
		for certain
		그 중에서 특정하려면 
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	who killed Archie Bloom is
		to convince the witness to talk.
		증인의 힘을 빌리는 수밖에 없지 
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:05	We've got a witness?
		증인이 있어?
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:08	Yeah.
		그럼 
00:29:09

00:29:35	- Patrick.
		- Mm.
		 
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:37	Well, it seems

00:29:39	Oops.
		웁스

		우리끼린 못하는 얘기가 없어서 
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:42	I'm the drag mom

		내가 여기 왕언니예요 
00:29:45	 
		 
00:29:45	When you're starting out,
		처음 입문한 상태라면 
00:29:46

		사수가 필요한 법이니까요 
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	And what do you do
		for them?
		정확히 뭘 도와주는데요?
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:49	Oh, what don't I do?
		뭘 안 도와주냐 묻는게 빠르죠?
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	I help them figure out
		where to shop,
		쇼핑은 어디서 해야 하는지 
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	how to dress,
		and who to become.
		옷은 어떻게 입어야 하는지

00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	Nothing wows

		초기 스타일 마돈나는 대성공이네요 
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	This is Miss Labelled.
		라벨양 
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	She runs a pizza joint

		리버 파크에서 피자집을 해요 
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:03	And what did Glennda
		teach you?
		글린다에게서 뭘 배웠죠?
00:30:05	 
		 
00:30:05	I learned how to market myself.
		Half off a large pepperoni...
		장사수완을 배웠어요, 피자 반값 할인이랄지... 
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	If you bring in your
		ticket stub from the show.
		그럼 쿠폰 좀 가지고 와 
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:10	I learned how

		전 단순하게 살면서도 
00:30:13	 
		 
00:30:13	and make it sparkle.
		빛나는 방법을 배웠죠

00:30:16	This is Frita People.
		프리타라고 해요 
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:17	Dentist by day,

		낮에는 치과의사, 밤에는 정열의 댄서죠 
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	Uh, excuse me.
		Wh-what's your name?
		그쪽 이름은 뭔가요?
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	Fifi Nix.

		Glennda teach you?
		피비 닉스, 글린다에게서 뭘 배웠죠?
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	How to accept who I am.
		제 자신을 수용하는 법이요 
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	Oh. I wish someone would

		누군가 제게도 그 비법을 
		가르쳐줬으면 좋겠군요, 대단해요 
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:33	So, Patrick, you didn't come
		all this way just to meet girls.
		그래요, 패트릭. 우리 애들에게
		인사나 하러 들른 건 아닐테고 
00:30:35	 
		 
00:30:35	You're right.
		그렇습니다 
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	Uh, we have some suspects
		in the murder investigation.
		살인 용의자가 거의 모였어요 
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:39	I was hoping
		that you could come in
		저희 쪽에 들러주셔서 
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	and pick out the killer
		from the lineup.
		용의자를 특정해 주셨으면 합니다 
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:44	I can't do that.
		도와드릴 수 없어요 
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	Uh, I might make myself
		his next target.
		그랬단 살인자의 다음 타겟이 될지 몰라요
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	Enough people hate us
		for who we are.
		지금 이대로의 저희를 증오하는 사람이 
		너무 많아요 
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	I'm not going to give them
		added incentive.
		무슨 구실을 더 주고 싶진 않아요 
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:52	I thought I made myself
		clear about that.
		그 점에 관해선 충분히 말씀드린 것 같은데요 
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	Well, what you have made
		clear here is that
		제가 분명히 알게 된건 
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	you know how to celebrate
		what's different...
		여러분이 여기서 여러분의 
		고유성을 찬미하는 동안 
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:00	And Archie Bloom was
		different,
		아치 블룸은 딱 그만큼 특별했기 때문에 
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	and he was burned alive
		for it.
		산채로 불태워졌다는 겁니다 
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:11	You have to go.
		언니, 가봐요 
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:20	Hmm.
		 
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	There you are.
		여기 있었구나 
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:27	I brought this for you.
		당신 먹으라고 사왔어요 
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:30	Thanks.
		고맙습니다 
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:32	You aren't gonna eat it?
		안 먹어요?
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	I'm not hungry.
		배고프지 않습니다 
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:36	Oh.
		 
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	What are you doing here?
		뭐하러 온 겁니까? 
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	I came to fill out
		some paperwork.
		서류 작성하러 왔지요 
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:40	A girl's gotta get paid.
		봉급날이거든요 
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	Right.
		그렇군요 
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	Yeah,
		and... I came to see you.
		그리고, 당신 보러 왔지요 
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:47	Hey, Summer.
		아, 서머 
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	Hey, Teresa.
		안녕, 테레사 
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	Hi, boss.
		반장님
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:55	What is that about?
		지금 뭐하는 거람?
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	Come here.
		이리 와요 
00:31:57	 
		 
00:31:57	Are you ashamed of me?
		내가 쪽팔려요?
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:04	I'm at work. She's my boss.
		We need to be discreet.
		난 회사에 있어요, 리스본은 내 상사고
		우리는 신중하게 행동해야 합니다 
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	It's nothing personal.
		사적으로 굴어선 안돼요 
00:32:09	 
		 
00:32:09	I get it.
		이해했어요 
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	I just wish
		we could be open,
		그냥 우리가 좀더 공개적이었으면 해요 
00:32:12	 
		 
00:32:12	like
		boyfriend and girlfriend.
		남자친구 여자친구처럼요 
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	We can,
		if you stop being my C.I.
		가능합니다, 당신이 내 정보원이 아니라면요 
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:17	I don't want to stop.
		I need this job.
		그건 안돼요, 난 이 일이 필요하니까 
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:19	The money's right,
		and I like it.
		돈도 돈이지만 이 일이 좋아요 
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:22	It's the first grown-up job
		I've had.
		내가 처음으로 가진 어른같은 일인걸 
00:32:24	 
		 
00:32:24	All right then.
		그럼 좋습니다 
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	No more fooling around
		at work, okay?
		직장에선 어린애처럼 굴기 없기에요, 알았죠?
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:27	Yes, sir, Agent Cho.
		On the double.
		알겠습니다, 조요원님. 시정하겠습니다 
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	Where's my money?
		내 봉급은 어딨어요?
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:32	Come on.
		따라와요 
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:36	Number 3,
		please step forward.
		3번 앞으로 나와주세요 
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:40	What about him?
		어때요?
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	Take your time.
		신중히 보고 말해요 
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:43	Mm...
		No, I don't think it's him.
		아닌것 같아요 
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:45	Thank you.
		감사합니다 
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:48	Number 4,
		please step forward.
		4번 앞으로 나와주세요 
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:52	Mnh-mnh. I'd remember him.
		He's a brute.
		기억나요. 완전 개망나니지 
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:57	Thank you,
		and, number 5, your turn.
		감사합니다, 5번 앞으로 나와주세요 
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	 
		 
00:33:02	You know him?
		아는 사람입니까?
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:06	That one definitely looks
		familiar.
		익숙한 인상이네요 
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:09	Is he the man you saw
		in the alley?
		골목에서 본 남잔가요?
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:11	Um...
		 
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	No, he--no, he's too big.
		아뇨, 너무 커요 
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	All of them are too big.
		The man that I saw was slender.
		여기 있는 사람 전부 다 너무 커요.
		제가 본 남잔 좀더 호리호리했어요 
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:22	Well, we tried.
		저희 노력이 부족했네요 
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	We did more than that.
		We confirmed my suspicions.
		실은 다 됐습니다, 제 의심이 걷혔습니다 
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:26	Glennda, come along.
		글린다, 따라오시죠 
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:27	There's some people
		I'd like you to meet.
		소개할 사람들이 있습니다 
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:33	Uh, you two are free to go.
		두분은 가셔도 좋습니다 
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	These sad specimens are
		the real suspects.
		이 세 사람이 진짜 용의자들입니다 
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:40	Not any longer.
		They're tainted.
		이젠 더는 아니지, 실대면을 시켜 버렸으니 
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	Jane, do you have any idea
		what you've done?
		제인, 지금 뭘 하는줄은 알고나 있는거야? 
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	I haven't done anything,
		but it's coming.
		난 아무것도 안했어, 하지만
		곧 모두 밝혀질거야 
00:33:46	 
		 
00:33:46	Glennda,
		meet the real suspects.
		글린다, 실제 용의자들을 보시죠 
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	Bachelor number one--
		a serial bully and a thief.
		용의자 일, 상습 절도범이자 양아치 
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:51	Is that a dude?
		저거 남자야? 
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	Bachelor number two owns
		his own bookstore.
		용의자 이, 서점을 경영하고 있지만 
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	He's a drug-addicted sadist...
		새디스트 약물 중독자죠 
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:56	Even the best dancer
		in the world would look crazy
		귀머거리의 눈에는 
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:58	to those who can't hear
		the music.
		세상의 제일가는 댄서도 간질환자일 뿐이지 
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:00	Who enjoys bad poetry.
		게다가 엉터리 시인이군요 
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	Which leaves us
		with bachelor number three
		그리고 용의자 삼, 
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:04	and the lowest life-form
		of them all--
		이 중 가장 최악의 인물입니다 
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	a father that rejected
		his own son.
		친아들을 내친 아버지죠 
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:09	Thank you. You just made
		my attorney's job much easier.
		고맙소, 방금 내 변호사 일을
		굉장히 도와주셨구료 
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	All three of these suspects
		are equally guilty
		이 용의자들은 아치 블룸의 목숨을 앗아간
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	for lighting the flames that
		took the life of Archie Bloom.
		불꽃에 정확히 같은 정도의 책임을
		지고 있습니다 
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	They can't all be the killer.
		셋다 범인일 순 없잖아 
00:34:20	 
		 
00:34:20	Well, sure they can, because I
		figured out who Glennda saw
		가능하고말고, 왜냐면 살인이 일어난 밤
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:23	in that alleyway the night
		the victim was murdered.
		글린다가 골목에서 본 사람이
		누군지 알아냈으니까 
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:30	Yes. Archie Bloom.
		그래요, 아치 블룸입니다 
00:34:33	 
		 
00:34:34	The young man that doused
		his own car with gas,
		이 젊은이는 스스로 차에 기름을 들이붓고 
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	handcuffed himself
		to the steering wheel,
		운전대에 수갑을 채운 다음
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	and then... lit a match.
		성냥을... 그었습니다 
00:34:43	 
		 
00:35:01	If the victim took
		his own life,
		피해자가 자살한거라면 
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:03	it exonerates my client
		of guilt.
		제 의뢰인은 무혐의 아닙니까 
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:05	Uh, all of our clients.
		저희 모두가요 
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:06	"Guilt" is a relative term.
		유죄란 상대적인 개념입니다 
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	You three men drove a boy
		to take his own life.
		여러분 셋 다 피해자를 죽음으로 몰아갔습니다 
00:35:12	 
		 
00:35:12	But before he did,
		he left clues
		그리고 피해자는 
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	to make each one of you
		a suspect.
		여러분 하나하나의 혐의를 암시하는
		단서를 남겼습니다 
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	What was the point?
		그래서 어쩌자는 건가요?
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	He had to know the evidence
		would never stand up.
		피해자는 혐의를 입증할 단서가
		없다는 것도 함께 알고 있었을 겁니다 
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	Archie rigged it
		아치는 그래서 여러분이 
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	so that if your clients
		didn't go down for murder,
		살인죄로 기소되지 못하더라도 
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:22	they'd each have to answer
		for their other crimes.
		각각의 여죄로 추궁 당하게끔
		고려했던 겁니다 
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	We're formally charging
		Rick Hughes with theft,
		저희는 공식적으로 릭 휴즈를 절도 혐의
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:26	Gabriel Lamb with drug dealing,
		가브리엘 램을 마약 거래 혐의로
		기소하겠습니다 
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	and Archie Bloom--
		그리고 아치 블룸... 
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:29	Will walk. I guarantee it.
		무혐의입니다, 장담해요 
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	Where is he going?
		장담하긴 뭘 합니까?
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	Your client handcuffed
		his gay son to a desk.
		당신 의뢰인은 아들이 동성애자라는
		이유로 의자에 결박했어요 
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:35	Wait till that video gets out.
		그 비디오가 공개된다고 생각해 보십쇼 
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	You're never gonna
		work again.
		교육학자로선 끝장이겠죠 
00:35:39	 
		 
00:35:39	It's just a shame a boy had
		to take his own life
		당신네들을 법적으로 처벌하기 위해 
00:35:41	 
		 
00:35:41	to bring each of you
		to justice.
		젊은이는 자기 목숨을 희생한 겁니다 
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:43	Carl, get 'em out of here.
		칼, 다 끌고 가요 
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	Such a nice face.
		이토록 귀여운 아이가 
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:49	Why did he choose our alley
		to end his life?
		왜 우리 골목을 택해 
		분신하려 했을까요?
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	Sometimes a dark alley
		is just a dark alley.
		딱히 의미는 없어요, 
		그냥 거기 골목이 있었던 거죠 
00:35:56	 
		 
00:36:10	Well...
		They've all been processed.
		뭐, 그놈들 다 처넣고 왔어 
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	Well,
		that's a big haul today.
		아주 대박 터진 날이었어 
00:36:15	 
		 
00:36:15	Solved a murder.
		You booked three scumbags,
		살인 사건도 해결해,
		악당을 셋이나 한꺼번에 처치해 
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	as you Coppers like to say.
		You should be very proud.
		경찰 입장에선 뿌듯해야 정상이지 
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:20	I don't think I've ever been
		so depressed about a case.
		이 사건만큼 찜찜한게 있었나 싶어 
00:36:23	 
		 
00:36:23	I can't get that kid out
		of my head.
		그 애 생각을 떨쳐낼 수가 없어 
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:27	You want some tea?
		차 한 잔 할래? 
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	I don't think
		tea's gonna do it.
		차 마셔서 어떻게 될 게 아닌것 같아 
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	Hmm.
		In that case,
		이런 상황에서는 
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	I think I know just the thing
		to cheer you up--
		네 기운을 북돋워줄 건 하나밖에 없어 
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	cabaret.
		카바레지 
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:39	Jane.
		제인
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	And if hurry,
		we can catch the late show.
		서두르면 마지막 공연에 맞출 수 
		있을지 몰라 
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	Come on. I need to get
		flowers on the way.
		꾸물대지마, 가는 길에
		꽃집에도 들러야 한다고 
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	Mmm.
		 
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:47	Come on.
		가자고! 
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:50	 
		 
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:05	Booty check.
		 
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:11	Oh. Now who died?
		또 누가 죽었나요?
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:13	Don't mind us.
		We come bearing well wishes
		신경쓰지 마세요
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	and flowers, so...
		Oh, thank you.
		공연 성공 기원겸 꽃을 가져왔을 뿐이니까 
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	Ah. Fifi Nix.
		피비 닉스 
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:20	This is, uh, Teresa Lisbon.
		이쪽은 테레사 리스본이고 
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:22	Hi.
		Fifi. These are for you.
		피비, 당신 위한 꽃이에요 
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	I just want to wish you luck
		with your new life.
		인생 새출발에 행운이 가득하길 빕니다 
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	You deserve the best.
		당신은 그럴 자격이 있어요 
00:37:28	 
		 
00:37:28	What new life?
		새출발이라니? 
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:30	Are you gonna tell her,
		or shall I?
		직접 말할래요, 아니면 내가 할까요?
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	I have no idea
		what you're talking about.
		무슨 말씀이신지 통 모르겠군요 
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:33	Such modesty.
		이렇게 겸손하셔서야 
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:35	Actually, I'm quite surprised
		you hadn't picked it up.
		솔직히 네가 아직도 몰랐단게 놀랍다 
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	"Fifi Nix."
		피비 닉스 
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	Phoenix.
		Risen from the ashes.
		피닉스, 잿더미에서 되살아난 불사조 말야 
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	Fifi Nix is Archie Bloom?
		피비 닉스가 아치 블룸이라고? 
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:49	 
		 
00:37:52	That's right. I was.
		네, 맞아요
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	Uh, Archie, I mean.
		아치, 예요 
00:37:56	 
		 
00:37:56	The suicide was staged?
		자살은 조작한 거였어?
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:57	Not at first.
		It was gonna be real.
		처음엔 정말 죽을 작정이었어요 
00:38:01	 
		 
00:38:01	They talked me out of it.
		그런데 이분들이 나오라고 하셨어요 
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:04	Where did you get
		the body?
		시신은 어디서 난거야?
00:38:06	 
		 
00:38:06	Well, here's hoping
		오렌지색 죄수복이 
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	I look good
		in prison orange.
		제게 어울리길 바라는 수밖에요 
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	I stole an unclaimed body
		from the cemetery where I work.
		제가 일하는 장례식장에서 
		무연고자 시신을 훔쳤어요 
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	It was destined
		for the Potter's Field.
		그냥 공동묘지행일 시신이었죠 
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:18	Ohh.
		 
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:19	Watch the head.
		머리 조심해 
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:21	Whoa, whoa.
		Drop it down.
		내려놔 
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	Come on.
		Oh.
		어서 
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:24	Ohh.
		Oh, my God.
		어쩜 좋아 
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	Watch your step.
		Watch the bag.
		발 밑 조심해 
00:38:27	 
		 
00:38:27	Come on. This way.
		이쪽으로 따라와 
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:28	Come on.
		Shangela, get the door.
		샨젤라, 문열어
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:32	All right. There. There.
		 
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:33	Ohh.
		 
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:34	Ohh!
		 Okay. Okay.
		 
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:43	Let's go. Let's go!
		 
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:49	My heel.
		 
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	Come on. Keep going.
		Keep going.
		 
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:52	And what about
		the dental records?
		그럼 치과기록은?
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:54	Well, Miss Frita People
		over there
		여기 프리타양이 
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	happens to be a dentist
		during the day.
		마침 낮에는 치과의사로 일하고 있어 
00:38:59	 
		 
00:38:59	Archie's dentist.
		아치의 치과의사예요 
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	Uh, I X-rayed the corpse
		and supplied your department
		시신의 치아를 촬영한 다음
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	with the film.
		댁네 경찰 쪽에 보냈죠 
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:04	That's how I met everyone.
		그렇게 만난 분들이에요 
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:06	Last year,
		I was getting a checkup.
		작년에 신체검사를 받는데 
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:09	I noticed traces
		of eyeliner
		치과의사 선생님 눈에 
00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:11	on my dentist.
		아이라이너 자국이 있더라구요 
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:13	He introduced me around.
		선생님이 여길 소개시켜주셨죠 
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	So you were all in on it?
		그럼 모두가 가담한 거예요? 
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	We're suckers for heartache.
		저흰 불쌍한거 보면 못참아요 
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:19	And that's why I lied about
		what I saw in the alley.
		그래서 골목에서 목격한 걸
		거짓말할 수밖에 없었어요 
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:24	She lied to protect us.
		우리 모두를 지키려고 거짓말한 거예요 
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:26	How did you know it was me?
		제 정체를 어떻게 아셨어요? 
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	Well, you're exactly what
		I expected to find,
		딱 당신같은 사람을 찾고 있었어요 
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:29	I mean, uh, aside from
		a little paint and bodywork.
		화장이랑 연기에 서툴렀죠 
00:39:33
