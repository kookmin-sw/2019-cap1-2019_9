00:00:03	Good morning, Madam President.
		좋은 아침입니다, 대통령 각하
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	May I introduce you
		to the ambassador of Java?
		자바 대사와 만나보시겠습니까?
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	Thank you.
		아, 고맙네
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	Because, after all,
		what is a travel mug
		텀블러란 말하자면
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	but a closet for your coffee?
		커피를 담는 옷장이거든
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	And boom,
		our next promotional giveaway.
		그러니까 짜잔
		우리 다음번 판촉물인거지
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	Wow.
		와우
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	Throw on a black turtleneck
		and some mom jeans,
		검은 터틀넥에 구식청바지만 입으면
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	It's like I'm married
		to Steve Jobs.
		스티브 잡스랑 결혼한 것 같겠어
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	I did hear you
		banging out e-mails
		당신 어제 밤 늦게까지
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	till all hours last night,
		이메일 작업하는 것 들었어
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	so the cucumbers in the sandwich
		can be repurposed
		샌드위치에 오이 들었으니
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	as lunchtime
		crow's-feet refreshers.
		점심시간에 
		눈가 주름 관리용으로 써도 돼
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Thank you.
		고마워
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Don't forget
		we've got drinks later.
		이따가 술자리 잊지마
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	Right. Any specific joke areas
		I should stay away from?
		맞아
		피해야할 농담 같은 거 있어?
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	No, don't worry about it.
		참, 그런 걱정 하지마
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	It's mostly just me and the guys
		talking business.
		나랑 남자들끼리 사업 얘기나 하는 거니까
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	Hey, you using
		those spin classes I got you?
		자기 내가 보내 준 스피닝 수업 듣고 있어?
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	Yeah.
		I went twice last week.
		응 지난 주에 두 번 갔어
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	You can't tell?
		모르겠어?
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	Sure, I can.
		딱 알겠는데
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	The best part about taking over
		my dad's company --
		아버지 회사를 물려받아서 제일 좋은 점이요?
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	I am now a powerful white male,
		and I love it.
		제가 이제 백인남성 지배계급이 됐다는 거고
		맘에 쏙 듭니다
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	I totally get now
		why we don't want anyone else
		우리가 누리는 걸
		남들한테 주기 싫다는 게
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:52	to have what we have.
		이제 이해가 가네요
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Honey, before I take off
		for work,
		있지 출근하기 전에..
00:00:56	 
		 
00:00:56	I saw this and I thought of you.
		이거 보고 당신 생각이 나더라구
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:02	What is it?
		이게 뭐야?
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:03	It's a key?
		열쇠네?
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:05	Yeah, it is.
		It is a key...
		맞아 열쇠야
00:01:06	 
		 
00:01:07	But a key to what?
		그런데 무슨 열쇠일까?
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:14	No!
		설마!
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:16	No!
		설마!
00:01:17	 
		 
00:01:17	You got me a PhunkeeDuck?!
		당신 *PhunkeeDuck 사온 거야?
		@@/*싸이보드@@\
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	No more walking for my man.
		Walking's for jerks.
		내 남자가 걸어다니면 쓰나
		바보들이나 걷지
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	My god!
		That is the best gift ever!
		맙소사!
		내가 받은 최고의 선물이야!
00:01:24	 
		 
00:01:24	I don't know where it stops
		and I begin!
		어디까지 갈지 모르겠지만
		일단 간다!

		핫소스 판매하는데
		성적 매력을 이용하는 건 알겠어
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	That's why I wore jordache jeans
		in my old closet ads.
		나도 그래서 옷장 광고할 때
		조다쉬 청바지 입었지
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:00	But a little much, isn't it?
		근데 이건 좀 심하지 않나?
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:02	It's obviously working.
		확실히 효과는 있잖아요
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	The store said that they put out
		가게측에서 말하길
00:02:05

		가서 만나봐야 겠어요
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:21	Hey, guys, take a pic.
		야야 사진 찍어줘
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	Hey, get out of here!
		That's my wife!
		어이 저리 꺼져!

00:02:27	I am a huge fan.
		정말 팬이에요
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:29	I have read your life story
		on your label a thousand times.
		라벨에 나와있는 선생님 
		인생이야기를 천번은 읽었어요
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:33	Is it true that your father
		crashed his pepper truck
		아버님께서 고추 트럭을 
		파파야 나무에 박는 바람에
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:36	into a papaya tree
		and the legend was born?
		전설이 탄생했다는 게 사실인가요?
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	You're asking me
		if something's real?
		지금 나한테 뭐가 사실인지 묻는 게요?
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:41	I can't believe that
		that cutout's an actual person.
		나야말로 저 판넬이
		실제 인물이라는게 안 믿기는 구만
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:49	Miles?
		마일스?
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	Hey, Jay.
		안녕하세요, 제이
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:51	Trying to read a text.
		그게 문자 좀 보려고
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:54	They keep the lights
		in here so low
		여기 조명이 너무 어둡거든요
00:02:56	 
		 
00:02:56	so they don't have to rotate
		the produce.
		농작물들 회전 안 시키려고
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	Don't give me that.
		헛소리 말아
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	I'm sorry, man.
		죄송합니다
00:02:59	 
		 
00:03:00	I've been lonely
		since Reynetta left.
		레네타가 떠나서 외로웠습니다
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	You're a deacon.
		자네 교회 집사잖나
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:04	Honey, foot rub.
		딸아, 발 마사지 좀
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	Pass.
		됐어요
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	Okay, there it is again!
		봐, 또야!
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	I'm telling you, something weird
		is going on up there.
		진짜야 위층에 뭔가 이상한 일 있는거야
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	We're renting our upstairs unit
		to earn a little extra cash
		저희가 위층을 빌려주고 있는데요
		여윳돈을 좀 벌까 해서요
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	and add a little extra tension
		to our marriage.
		그런데 그게 저희 결혼에
		꽤나 긴장을 더해주고 있어요
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	Our current guests registered
		지금 숙박중인 사람들이
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	as Mr. and Mrs. Wilkerson
		and Tommy.
		윌커슨 부부 그리고 토미인데요
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	I was expecting a nice young
		couple and their little boy.
		친절한 젊은 부부와 
		어린 아이를 생각했죠
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:28	Hello. You --
		아, 안녕하세요
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	So, you -- you must be
		Mr. and Mrs. Wilkerson?
		그러니까 저 두분이
		윌커슨 부부시고
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:33	- That's right.
		- So you're Tommy?
		- 맞습니다
		- 그쪽 분이 토미?
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	He is.
		네
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	Welcome.
		어서오세요
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	Cam, let's help them
		with their trunk.
		캠, 짐 좀 들어드리자
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:39	No!
		아니오!
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	No? Okay, well,
		here is the key.
		네? 아, 음 그럼
		열쇠는 여깄구요
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:43	- Here you are.
		- Thank you.
		- 여기요
		- 감사합니다
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:45	Tommy?
		토미?
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:48	Okay, what is that all about?
		좋아, 방금 뭐 였지?
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	I mean, three adults?
		성인 세명이라고?
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	Why doesn't Tommy
		have a last name?
		왜 토미는 성이 없는 거지?
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	Why doesn't Tommy talk?
		Is he their captive?
		왜 토미는 말을 안 할까?
		포로라도 되는 걸까?
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:56	Is Mrs. Wilkerson their captive?
		Is the captive in the trunk?
		윌커슨 부인이 포로인가?
		트렁크안에 포로가 든 건가?
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	So there has to be a captive?
		포로가 필수 요소인 거야?
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	Lately, we've been getting
		negative reviews
		최근에 저희가 세입자들 일부로부터
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	- from some of our renters.
		- Say it.
		- 좀 부정적인 평가를 받았어요
		- 말해봐
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:04	And they tend to follow
		the common theme
		그게 공통된 내용이 있는데
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	that the "bigger one"
		is "nosy."
		"큰 쪽"이 "오지랖"이 넓대요
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:09	While others say
		the "orange fella"
		혹자는 "오렌지남"이
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	is "standoffish and cold."
		"매정하고 쌀쌀맞다" 고 하더군요
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:14	Who says that?
		누가 그러는데?
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	I'm saying it now.
		내가 지금 하잖아
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:19	Okay, we need to find out
		what that is.
		저게 뭔지 알아내야 해
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:21	Cam, stay out of their business,
		all right?
		캠, 상관 말고 내버려 둬
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	If we drop below three stars,
		we're gonna be stuck renting
		평점 3점 밑으로 내려가면
		꼼짝없이 골초들이나
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:24	to chain smokers
		and pregnant foreigners
		미국에서 원정출산하는 외국인들한테
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	trying to have their babies
		in America.
		빌려줄 수 밖에 없다구
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:28	Mark down the time.
		I just turned into my father.
		잘 기억해 둬
		내가 우리 아빠로 변한 순간이니까
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	I'm going up.
		나 올라갈거야
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	Cam...
		캠
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:34	Cam, what are you doing?!
		캠 뭐하는 거야
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:36	I am checking on our guests.
		확인하는 것 뿐이야
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:38	Hello!
		All three of you.
		안녕하세요
		세 분 다 계셨네요
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Just stopped by to see
		if you guys need
		그냥 한번 들러봤어요 혹시 저
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	Some fresh --
		fresh towels.
		새 타월 필요하신가 해서
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	We're fine, thank you.
		괜찮습니다 감사합니다
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	Yes, you were
		gonna say something?
		아 뭔가 하실 말씀이 있으신 게?
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	You saw that, right?
		봤지?
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	Mrs. Wilkerson was giving me
		the distress signal.
		윌커슨 부인이 나한테
		조난 신호 보내려고 했어
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	She was like...
		막 이렇게
00:04:53	 
		 
00:04:53	Come on.
		가자
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:55	Cam!
		캠!
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	Us again.
		Just triple-checking
		또 저희예요
		다시 한번 확인드릴려구요
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:58	to see if you need
		some hand soap,
		혹시 비누라든가
00:04:59	 
		 
00:05:00	a chance to talk to one of us
		alone, some muffins.
		단 둘이 얘기할 기회나
		머핀 안 필요하세요?
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	Really, we're fine.
		You don't have to keep checking.
		정말로 괜찮습니다
		계속 확인 안 하셔도 돼요
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Help!
		헤ㄹ프!
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:07	She did not say "help."
		"도와줘"라고 한 거 아냐
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	So you did hear it.
		너도 들었단 거네
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:12	Hey, Delgado, thank your mom
		for my new screen saver.
		야 델가도
		엄마한테 화면보호기 고맙다고 전해라
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:15	Will do, Parker.
		그러지, 파커
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	And speaking
		of two-dimensional women
		참 소스 좀 잘 아는
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	who know a thing or two
		about sauce,
		2D 여자 얘기가 나와서 말인데
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	stop by Flanagan's and say hi
		to your mom for me.
		저쪽 술집에 들러서
		니네 엄마한테 안부 좀 전해드려
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:25	I know you were bothered
		by that cutout.
		그 판넬때문에 신경쓰이는 거 안다
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:28	But every teenager gets teased,
		하지만 십대들은 다 괴롭히고 그런 거다
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	and you have to rise
		above it, so --
		그러니 그런 것에 굴하지 말고-
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	- Your mother's in the trunk.
		- What?
		- 니네 엄마 트렁크에 있다
		- 네?
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	I couldn't stand the ogling
		and the selfies,
		인간들 흘끔거리고 
		셀카찍는 거 참을 수가 없어서
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	so I stole it --
		For both our sakes.
		훔쳤다
		우리 둘 다를 위해서지
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	We're in this together.
		이제 우린 한 배를 탄거야
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	How?
		I didn't steal it.
		어째서요?
		제가 훔친 게 아니라구요
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	I see where this is going.
		어떻게 흘러갈 지 알지
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	You complain and complain,
		I make the problem go away,
		너는 계속 불평만 하면
		내가 문제를 해결하고
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:43	and you had nothing
		to do with it.
		넌 아무 관련없던 게 되는 거지
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	I didn't ask for this.
		I didn't ask for any of this.
		제가 부탁한 거 아니에요
		전 아무것도 안 헀다구요
00:05:46	 
		 
00:05:46	Let's not turn on each other.
		It'll make us sloppy.
		서로를 공격하진 말자
		허술해 질 뿐이니까
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	I need your help
		to get rid of it.
		저걸 없애는 데 네 도움이 필요해
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	God knows I've already tried.
		맹세코 다 시도해봤어
00:05:53	 
		 
00:06:00	Son of a...
		이런-
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:11	Son of a...
		이런 ㅅ
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	A lot of cool storage solutions
		coming out of Asia?
		아시아쪽에서 꽤 괜찮은
		수납 아이디어가 나오네요
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Yeah, there really are.
		아 그렇죠
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:17	But I think you might be
		even more interested
		하지만 이 쪽에서 나오는 게
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	in what's been coming
		out of Cuba.
		더 흥미있으실 걸요
		쿠바산이죠
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	Hey-o!
		 
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:20	Is she the best or what?
		진짜 최고 아닙니까?
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	Shall we?
		가실까요?
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	Let's do it.
		그래요
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	You know what, honey?
		자기야?
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:27	We are just gonna talk
		about work.
		우리 그냥 사업 얘기나 할거야
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	Why don't you stay
		and have another drink?
		여기서 한잔 더 하는 게 어때?
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	Well, you don't
		have to twist my arm.
		억지로 시킬 필요도 없지
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	What do you say, ladies?
		Another round of sapphire sins?
		어떠세요, 숙녀분들?
		사파이어 신즈 한 잔 씩 더?
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	Ooh, yes, please.
		아이 그럼요
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	Phil, you are just so much fun.
		필, 정말 너무 재밌으세요
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	It is so nice to hear those
		words come out of a man's mouth.
		남자 입에서 고맙단 말 들으니 정말 좋네
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	Tell me about it.
		내 말이 그말이야
00:06:43	 
		 
00:06:43	Ever since Kyle
		got that promotion,
		우리남편 저번에 승진하고 나서부터
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:45	he barely acknowledges me.
		고마운 척도 안 해
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	Come on, now, I'm sure
		he knows how lucky he is.
		그런 말 말아요 
		카일도 자기가 행운안 거 알죠
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	You have the twins,
		a spotless house,
		쌍둥이 낳았지
		티끌 하나 없는 집에
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	Killer yoga arms.
		요가로 단련된 팔까지
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	Aw.
		 
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:53	Unh-unh.
		This happens all the time --
		아냐아냐 늘 이래요
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	They get on their track
		to success,
		조금 성공가도를 달린다싶으면
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	and you become
		the invisible housewife.
		부인은 투명 인간 되는 거야
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	I don't know about all the time.
		전혀 모르겠어요
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	Sitting with all those gals,
		I thought,
		부인들이랑 앉아 있으면서 생각했죠
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	"wow, this is an insane
		amount of perfume.
		"와, 향수 냄새 장난 아니다
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	And also, am I on my way
		그리고 나도 그렇게 되는 건가?
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	to becoming
		an invisible housewife?"
		투명인간 주부라고?"
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	No way.
		There'd be signs, right?
		설마요
		뭔가 조짐은 있지 않겠어요?
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:12	Hey, stranger.
		Been keeping dinner warm for ya.
		오셨어요, 낯선 분
		당신 저녁 데우고 있었어
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	That's nice.
		I had a steak at the club.
		아 고마워라
		클럽에서 스테이크 먹었지만
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	But I wouldn't knock a scotch
		out of your hands.
		스카치 한 잔은 사양 안 할게
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	Sure thing.
		물론이지
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	Hey, is now an okay time
		당신 지금 괜찮으면
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	to go over
		this list of house stuff?
		집안일 처리할 거 좀 봐줄래?
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	Let's see.
		어디 보자
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	Don't care, don't care,
		call a guy, don't care.
		관심 없음 관심 없음
		사람 불러 관심 없음
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:27	Guess who got the big listing
		on Westmount today.
		오늘 누가 부자동네 계약 따냈게
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	That's great, sweetie.
		It'll keep you busy.
		잘됐네 자기야
		바쁘게 지낼 수 있겠어
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:34	Is that a new bracelet?
		그 팔찌 새 거야?
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:36	Yes, it is.
		응 맞어
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	Jim bought it for me
		after our last big fight.
		저번에 크게 싸우고 나서
		남편이 사왔더라
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	I was on him about taking
		all those business trips.
		맨날 출장 다니는 것 땜에 뭐라 그랬거든
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	That's what they do.
		늘 그런식이야
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	Throw some new piece of jewelry
		at you to keep you happy.
		기분 풀게 해줄려고
		보석 던져주는 거지
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	Not that I'm complaining.
		그렇지
		불만있는 건 아니구
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	Hello.
		어머나 세상에
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:51	Right?
		그렇죠?
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:54	Good, mom's car is gone.
		다행이야, 엄마 차가 없어요
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	All right.
		My hand saw is in the garage.
		좋아
		차고에 내 톱이 있을 거야
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	You'll hold her down,
		I'll cut the head off --
		네가 엄마를 잡으면
		내가 머리를 잘라내-
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	Jay!
		- 제이!
		- 헠
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	My car got a flat tire,
		so it got towed.
		내 차 타이어가 펑크 나서
		견인됐어요
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	I need a ride to Phil's.
		필네 집에 좀 태워줘요
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	He's helping me finish
		my sauce website.
		내 소스 웹사이트 마무리작업 도와준대요
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:06	Manny, baby, why are you crying?
		매니 왜 우는 거니?
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	I'm not.
		안 울어요
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:11	Ooh, I got another e-mail
		from the store.
		가게에서 또 이메일 왔네
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	I bet you
		that I sold another --
		틀림없이 다 팔았다는
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	What the hell?
		Somebody stole my cutout.
		이게 무슨
		누가 내 판넬을 훔쳐갔대요
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	Stolen? Damn it!
		훔쳐갔다고? 망할!
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	Well, there's no point
		in replacing it
		새로 갖다놔도 소용이 없겠구만
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	because it's just gonna
		get stolen again.
		또 누가 훔쳐갈 게 뻔하니까
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	I can't replace it.
		새로 갖다 둘 것도 없어요
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	It took two weeks
		그 움직이는 팔 만드는데만
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:27	just to get the mechanical arm
		working right.
		2주나 걸렸었다구요
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	Wait till I catch this rat.
		이 쥐새끼를 잡아야지
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	I'm going to make him regret
		that he was ever...
		후회하게 만들어주겠어 
		감히 그걸..
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:34	Hey, Jay, turn the heater on.
		제이 히터 좀 틀어요
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	I can hear Manny's
		teeth chattering.
		매니 이가 달달 떨리잖아요
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:39	What is that noise?
		이건 무슨 소리야
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	I don't hear anything.
		아무 소리 안 들리는데요
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:44	What is that thumping noise?
		툭탁거리는 소리 안 들려요?
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	Manny, go check the trunk.
		매니, 가서 트렁크 좀 봐라
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	I don't really feel like
		getting my hands dirty, Jay.
		제 손을 더럽히긴 싫은데요, 제이
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:51	Your hands are plenty dirty
		already, buddy boy.
		이미 더럽혀졌단다
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	Go deal with it.
		가서 처리해
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:55	I am going to find
		who did this, Jay,
		누가 그랬는지 밝혀내서
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	and I'm going to make him hurt.
		죄값을 치르게 하고 말거예요
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:01	Every thief makes a mistake.
		모든 범인은 실수를 하게 마련이지
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	Gloria, you're letting this
		get to you.
		글로리아
		당신 너무 신경쓰고 있잖아
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	You know what always
		calms you down?
		이럴때 진정시켜주는 게 뭔지 알아?
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	Joe's little duck song.
		조가 좋아하는 오리노래야
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	Now, let's --
		Let's get that going.
		한번 들어보자구
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	I hate him.

00:09:33	 
		그래요
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:34	I feel like I know him, Phil.
		누군지 알 것 같은데
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	Whoever it is, it looks like
		they want to get caught.
		누군진 몰라도

00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	He keeps going back
		for the cheese cubes.

00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	I can't watch this anymore.
		더이상 못 보겠어요
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	- Let's just work on my website, okay?
		- Sure.
		- 웹사이트 작업이나 해요
		- 그래요
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:45	Claire: Phil, I'm late for
		an appointment with a client.
		필, 나 고객이랑 약속 늦었어
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	Can you do me a favor?
		부탁 좀 해도 돼?
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	If it's to put flowers
		in the bathroom, I already did.
		화장실에 꽃 두는 거면
		벌써 했어
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	I hadn't noticed.
		그런게 있었어?
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Not surprised.
		놀랍지도 않군
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	Okay, I was supposed to get
		this client a bottle of scotch.
		고객 한 명한테 스카치 한 병 주기로 했는데
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	I haven't had time
		to do it myself.
		내가 직접 할 시간이 없어
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	So can you pick one up
		and bring it down to the office?
		당신이 하나 골라서
		사무실로 좀 가져다 줄래?
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	Whatever you need.
		뭐든 말만해
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	- I have to go out for a haircut anyway.
		?? Great.
		- 어차피 머리자르러 갈 거였거든
		?- 잘됐네
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	Except I got
		a haircut yesterday.
		어제 머리 잘랐지만 말야
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:04	Okay, wow. This kitchen
		really is a mess?
		그래 부엌 진짜 엉망이다 그지
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	I'm off.
		나 갈게
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	Don't.
		하지마
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:12	Excuse me, Gloria.
		잠깐만요, 글로리아
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	Apparently, I don't know
		how to keep a kitchen clean.
		듣자하니 제가 부엌 청소를 못 하나봐요
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	What is that?
		그게 뭐예요?
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	It's just a little
		hush-up gift
		아, 그냥 입막음용 선물이에요
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:19	from my powerful wife who thinks
		she can take me for granted.
		내 도움을 당연하게 생각하는
		제 능력있는 아내가 준 거죠
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	And I'll just hover after her
		like a little puppy dog.
		난 그냥 강아지처럼
		주변을 맴돌 뿐이구요
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	You have to stop
		putting up with it.
		참으면 안돼요
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:27	They don't mean to ignore you,
		but it will only get worse.
		일부러 무시하려는 건 아닌데
		놔두면 점점 심해질 거에요
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	One time
		when I had just married Jay,
		내가 제이랑 막 결혼했을 땐데
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	I spent a whole day cooking
		his favorite dinner.
		하루 종일 그이가 제일 좋아하는
		저녁식사를 준비했죠
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	- Beef Wellington and a baked potato
		with all the fixin's? - Yes.
		- 비프 웰링턴이랑 온갖 다 들어간 구운 감자요?
		- 네
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	And then when he got home,
		he barely noticed what I had made.
		제이가 집에 왔을 땐
		뭘 만들었는지 알아볼 수도 없었어요
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	So I took the emerald pendant
		that he had bought me
		제이가 벌써 세번을 저녁식사를 놓쳐서
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	for the three past dinners
		that he had missed
		나한테 에메랄드 목걸이를 사줬었는데
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	and I threw it at his head.
		그걸 벗어서 얼굴에다 던졌죠
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	I told him
		I don't need fancy things.
		이런 반짝거리는 거 필요없다고
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	I need the respect.
		존중이 필요하다고 말했죠
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	Isn't that an emerald pendant?
		지금 걸고 있는 그 목걸이에요?
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	It made its way back to me.
		저절로 돌아오더라구요
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	But the point is that you
		have to make a statement.
		요점은 필이 한마디 해야한다는 거예요
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	You have to give back
		the hoverboard.
		그 호버보드 돌려주라구요
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	You know what?
		있죠?
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	I hate to admit it,
		but you're right.
		인정하긴 싫지만
		그 말이 맞아요
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	 
		이런
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:05	Phil?
		필?
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	This happens. You just got
		to let the battery run out.
		가끔 이래요
		방전될 때까지 놔두면 돼요
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:10	We're out of stamps.
		I'm heading to the post office.
		우표 다 썼어
		우체국 가려고 하는데
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	- Do you need anything?
		- No, I'm good.
		- 필요한 거 있어?
		- 없어 괜찮아
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	What are you doing?
		뭐 하고 있었어?
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	Just a little research.
		그냥 조금 검색
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:16	"Wilkersons plus adults Tommy
		plus mysterious trunk."
		"윌커슨+성인 토미+의심스러운 트렁크"
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	Okay, now try googling
		그래 이제 이걸로 찾아봐
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	"irrational meddling
		plus homosexual."
		"비이성적인 간섭+게이"
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	Okay, Mitchell, what if they're
		a part of some weird cult?
		저 사람들 이상한 종교 집단이면 어떡해?
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	Remember that "20/20" we watched
		저번에 본 20/20* 생각나?
		@@/*그알같은 TV 매거진@@\
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	where they infiltrated
		the ritual ceremony
		종교 집단에 침투해서
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:29	And Elizabeth Vargas had
		to almost sacrifice a squirrel?
		엘리자베스 바거스가 
		다람쥐를 제물로 바칠 뻔 했잖아?
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	I went through the bag
		they dumped in the trash.
		그 사람들이 버린 쓰레기를 찾아봤어요
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:35	Hi...
		아 안녕..
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	Now you're involving
		our daughter?
		우리 딸까지 끼어들게 한거야?
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	I don't know
		what she's talking about.
		무슨 소린지 모르겠네
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	Okay, you know what?
		좋아
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	You need to get
		out of the house.
		집에서 좀 나가
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	Go get the stamps.
		우표 사와
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	And a hobby.
		취미도 좀 갖고
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	Okay, well, they're in our home,
		그래 좋아 
		저런 사람들이 우리 집에 있는데
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	And I'm just trying
		to protect our family.
		난 우리 가족을 지키려고 한 것 뿐야
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	I don't want to wake up dead.
		어느날 눈떠보니 죽어있긴 싫다구
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	I can't believe I have
		to say this to you again.
		또 이 말을 해야되다니
		믿을 수가 없다
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	You cannot wake up and be dead.
		눈 뜨는 거랑 죽는 건 동시에 못해
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	It's an expression!
		관용어거든
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	It's not.
		아니거든
00:11:56	 
		 
00:11:56	Daddy should not have
		involved you in his snooping.
		아빠 저러는데 널 끼어들게 하면 안됐어
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	So you don't want me to tell you
		what I found in here?
		그럼 여기에 뭐가 있는지 말하지 말아요?
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:00	No...
		응...
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	Well, of course I looked.
		물론 봤죠
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	And inside I found latex gloves,
		a bottle of bleach,
		그 안에 라텍스 장갑이랑 락스
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	Heavy-duty tarp.
		두터운 방수포가 있었죠
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	Now, I've never killed anyone
		and cleaned it up,
		제가 누굴 죽이고 치워본 적은 없지만
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	but that sounds like a kit.
		딱 거기 필요한 장비같긴 해요
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	So as soon as I saw them
		drive off
		그래서 그 사람들이 
		자기네 창문없는 살인마 승합차타고
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	in their windowless murder van,
		I-I ran upstairs.
		나가자마자 위층에 올라갔어요
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:21	My god!
		맙소사
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:25	What are you?
		뭐야 이게
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:37	The people are back!
		그 사람들 돌아왔어요
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	Shh!
		쉿!
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:40	Is this gonna be
		a daily thing now, Tommy,
		이제 정기적으로 하는 거야, 토미?
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	losing your phone?
		폰 잃어버리는 거?
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:46	Thank god.
		하나님 감사
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:49	Wait.
		Where are you going?
		잠깐 
		어디 가는 거야?
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	 
		헉
00:12:51	 
		 
00:13:00	Hey.
		Um, what's up?
		여보세요 왜?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	I'm still getting stamps.
		아직 우표 사고 있어
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	Look to your left.
		왼쪽을 봐
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	What are you doing?
		뭐 하는 거야?
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	I'm hiding.
		They're here.
		숨어 있어
		그 사람들 여기 있어
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	I came up to see if anything
		weird was going on.
		무슨 일이 일어나는지 보러 왔어
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	Did ya? Were you curious?
		Gettin' a little nosy?
		그랬어? 궁금하셨어?
		간섭 좀 해보려고?
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	Not the time.
		지금 그러기야
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	What are these creepy things?
		이 소름끼치는 것들은 뭐야?
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	If these dolls could talk...
		혹시 이 인형들 말을 한다거나..
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	They'd tell you I dropped one
		and then their head came off.
		그럼 내가 하나 떨어뜨려서
		머리가 떨어져나갔다고 이르겠지
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	Well, you have to put it back.
		얼른 돌려놔
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	Maybe they won't notice
		one of them's missing.
		하나쯤 없어져도 모를지도 몰라
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	Yeah, this seems like
		a casual interest.
		퍽도 그렇게 가벼운 취미로 보인다
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:25	My gosh, here they come.
		맙소사 온다
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	Okay, I'll create a distraction
		so you can get back in there.
		좋아, 내가 신경을 딴데로 돌릴게
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	I simply invited them to
		a complimentary cocktail hour.
		간단하게 칵테일 한잔 하자고 초대했죠
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	Even possible satanists
		enjoy a triple-cream brie
		악마숭배자들이라도
		트리플 크림 브리치즈랑
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	and a crisp chardonnay.
		산뜻한 샤도네이 와인은 좋아하지 않겠어요
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	So, what brings you all to town?
		이 곳엔 어떻게 오신 거예요?
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	We're here for
		the Chuckled Chums convention.
		처클드 첨스(Chuckled Chums) 컨벤션 때문에요
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	I'm sorry,
		the -- the Chuckled Chums?
		죄송해요
		처클드 첨스요?
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	They're a line
		of ceramic figurines.
		도자기 조각품의 한 라인인데요
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	We're avid collectors.
		저희가 그 열성적인 수잡가들이거든요
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:51	- Well, that sounds fun.
		- Yeah.
		- 참 재밌겠네요
		- 네
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	Every year we gather together
		with like-minded Chum lovers
		매년 마음 맞는 애호가들끼리 모여서
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:57	To share our favorite pieces.
		제일 좋아하는 작품들 공유하곤 해요
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:59	Yes? You --
		You want to say s--
		네? 뭔가 말씀하고 싶으신 게-
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	Help!
		헤ㄹ프!
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:02	Bless you, darling.
		저런, 여보
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	You've probably guessed.
		I'm the figurine restorer.
		짐작하셨겠지만
		전 복원 전문가입니다
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	We're so excited.
		정말 기대됩니다
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:08	Ours is this year's
		featured collection
		저희가 올해 특별 초대전을 하거든요
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	because of its size
		and pristine condition.
		규모나 아주 새 것같은 상태 덕분이죠
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	I hope the industrial polisher
		we brought wasn't too loud.
		저희 공업용 광택기가
		너무 시끄럽지 않았으면 좋겠네요
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	No, we can't hear anything
		that goes on upstairs.
		아뇨, 위층 소리는 하나도 안 들려요
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:20	Okay.
		좋아
00:14:22	 
		 
00:14:22	All right.
		됐어
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	No.
		아니지
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:26	No, no, no, no, no!
		No, no, no, no, no!
		안돼 안돼!
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	No, no!
		No, no, no!
		안돼!
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	God, no!
		오 갓 노우!
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:35	Fortunately, Chuckle Chums
		다행히도, 처클 첨스가
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	aren't all that expensive
		to replace.
		그렇게 비싼 건 아니었어요
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	They're mainly just an excuse
		for lonely people to go outside.
		그냥 외로운 사람들이
		밖에 나올 구실 같은 거였죠
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	- Point is, we learned our lesson.
		No more snooping. - Absolutely.
		- 중요한 건, 교훈을 얻은 거에요
		더이상 참견않기 - 네
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	Although we still don't have
		an explanation
		다만 아직 풀리지 못한 건
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	for those creaky floorboards
		in the middle of the night.
		한밤중에 삐걱거리는 바닥 소리예요
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	Heavy-footed going one way,
		light coming back.
		갈 때는 아주 무거운 발걸음인데
		올 땐 아주 가벼웠어요
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:52	Was it Tommy joining his Chums
		for a m챕nage 횪 trois,
		토미가 인형들과 쓰리섬하러 갔다가
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	then being replaced
		by Mrs. Wilkerson on the couch?
		소파에 있던 윌커슨 부인과 바꾼 걸까요?
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	Okay, you need...
		Help!
		너 진짜 도움이 필요하다
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:02	Son of a bitch.
		이런 빌어먹을
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	I broke two saw blades
		on this thing,
		톱날을 두 개나 부숴먹고
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	And now these miracle shears
		are no good.
		이제 이 기적의 가위도 못 쓰겠구만
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	Guy who sold me these at the front
		door cut through a horseshoe.
		이거 판 사람이 말굽도 잘라냈었다고
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	Hold on.
		Let's try your shredder.
		잠깐만요
		분쇄기를 써보죠
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	What's that doing
		down here anyway?
		왜 그런 게 집에 있는 거냐?
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	I made an executive decision
		제가 용단을 내렸어요
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	about some of Joe's
		lesser artwork.
		조의 형편없는 그림들 처리하려고요
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	Help me lift this thing.
		이거나 들자
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:19	Hey, it's working!
		돼요!
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	The best shredder money can buy.
		돈으로 살 수 있는 최고의 분쇄기야
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	In 2004, our whisper-close
		hamper technology
		2004년에 우리 변기식 바구니 기술이
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:24	got stolen out of the trash,
		got sold on the dark web.
		쓰레기장에서 도난 당해서
		인터넷 암시장(dark web)에 팔렸지
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	Never again.
		두번 다신 안돼
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	No, it's stuck!
		안돼, 걸렸어요!
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	Gloria: Hola!
		올라!
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:33	Hey!
		오셨어요!
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	Hey, you're back early?
		빨리 왔네?
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	Yeah, I didn't want
		to go back to that store
		그 가게에 다시 가면
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	and get angry again.
		화만 날 것 같아서요
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	- I just want to relax.
		- Yeah.
		- 그냥 쉬고 싶어요
		- 그래
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:42	Manny!
		매니!
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:44	Yes, mama?
		네 엄마?
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Can you please draw me a bath
		목욕물 좀 받아주겠니?
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	with those fancy bath salts
		that you have?
		네 그 목욕 소금 넣어서 말야
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	I usually save those
		for spec--
		아 그건 좀 특별할 때를 위해서 아껴-
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Just draw the damn bath.
		그냥 가서 목욕물 받아라
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	I'll get you a nice
		glass of wine to go with it.
		하면서 마실 와인 한 잔 줄게
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	- Okay.
		- Come on, honey,
		- 좋죠
		- 어서와
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	I got a nice chardonnay out here
		you're gonna like.
		당신이 좋아할만한 샤도네이 준비해뒀지
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	Is that Stella?
		스텔라 아니에요?
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	No, definitely not.
		아니, 절대 아냐
00:15:59	 
		 
00:16:01	What did you bring?
		뭘 가져 온거니?
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:02	Gloria, wait.
		글로리아 기다려
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:04	Gloria, don't be mad.
		글로리아, 화내지 마
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	It must have been
		that old witch, Auntie Alice!
		그 늙은 마녀 앨리스 이모 짓이에요!
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	She must have left this
		as a warning!
		경고의 의미로 이것만 둔거야
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	Devious.
		사악하구만
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	Dang it, I got my fingerprints
		all over it now.
		젠장, 이제 내 지문도 다 묻었겠군
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	I bet she was the one
		who gave me that flat tire.
		타이어 펑크 난 것도 
		그 여자 짓인게 뻔해
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:20	Who are you calling?
		어디 전화하는 거야?
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:27	...Auntie Alice.
		앨리스 이모
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:29	What was that?
		누구야?
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:31	She's going to pay.
		죄값을 치를 거예요
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	You don't even know it was her.
		확실하지도 않잖아
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	Whatever that was,
		you got to call it off.
		방금 그거, 뭔진 몰라도 어서 취소해
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:35	I know it was her.
		I saw the evil in her eyes.
		그 여자 짓이에요
		눈에서 악마를 봤다고요
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	She probably has cataracts.
		백내장일 수도 있지
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:39	For god's sake,
		Gloria, I did it.
		아 젠장 글로리아, 나야
		449
		00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,835
		- 내가 훔친 거야
		- 당신이?
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:41	- I stole the cutout.
		- You?
		 
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:42	I didn't love the way those guys
		were taking pictures with it.
		남자새끼들이 사진찍고 하는 게 싫었어
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	Jay, but you've never
		been jealous like this.
		제이, 이렇게 질투한 적 없잖아요
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	Well, when we first met,
		처음 만났을 때야 그랬지
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	but then I realized
		it's a full-time job.
		정신차리고 보니 풀타임 직업이더라고
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	There's nothing wrong with being
		protective of your wife.
		부인을 보호하고 싶어하는 데
		잘못 된 건 없어요
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	It means that you care.
		당신이 날 아낀단 거잖아요
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	Is something bad happening
		to that poor woman?
		그 불쌍한 여자는 어떻게 되는 거야?
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	I don't know details.
		I let them decide.
		자세한 건 몰라요
		결정은 그쪽이 하는 거라
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	They don't like to feel managed.
		이래라 저래라 하는 거 싫어해서
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	I'm begging you
		to make that call!
		제발 다시 전화 좀 해봐!
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	Auntie Alice spoke at career day
		at my high school!
		나 고등학교 때 취업박람회에서 연설한 분이라고!
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:08	Hello?
		여보세요?
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:10	No, we didn't order flowers.
		아뇨, 꽃 시킨 적 없는데요
00:17:12	That's them.
		Tell them no tulips.
		그 사람들이에요
		튤립은 하지 말라고 해요
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	No tulips.
		튤립은 안됩니다
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:16	They hung up.
		끊었어
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	Good thing that I remembered
		the code.
		암호를 기억하고 있어서 다행이에요
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:20	Okay, now, my -- mwah! --
		Big jealous man,
		그럼 이제 내 질투쟁이 남편님
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	let's go and have some wine.
		와인 한 잔 하러가요
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	I don't know why that cutout
		bugged me so much.
		그 판넬이 왜 그렇게 신경쓰였는지 모르겠어
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	I guess probably because I have
		more time now to be jealous.
		질투할 시간이 많아서 그런가 봐
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	Okay, now, you have more time
		to take me upstairs
		자 이제 위층에 올라가서
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	and show me what those bad men
		were doing to me at the store.
		가게에서 그 나쁜 놈들이
		나한테 뭘 하고 있었는지 말해줘요
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	I'm getting back
		to liking retirement.
		다시 은퇴한 게 좋아지는군
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:39	I told you to say
		no roses, right?
		내가 장미는 안된다고 했죠?
00:17:41	Tulips!
		튤립이었어!
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:43	I'm sure it's fine.
		괜찮을 거예요
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:47	Here's the scotch you asked for.
		당신 부탁한 스카치
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:51	And also,
		there's something else.
		그리고 하나 더 있어
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	I'm returning the hoverboard.
		호버보드 돌려줄게
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	Fine. I-I think the receipt
		was in the box.
		그래 상자에 영수증 있을 거야
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	Okay.
		Well, good.
		그래 뭐 좋아
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Because I can't accept a gift
		if it's just a shiny
		왜냐면 이 반짝이는 
		서보 제어식 선물이
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	servo-controlled substitute
		for respect and appreciation.
		존중과 감사와 맞바꾼거라면
		난 받지 않을 거거든
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	I'm not invisible, Claire.
		나 투명인간이 아냐, 클레어
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:06	You married a strong
		and capable man who --
		당신은 강하고 뭐든 할 수 있는 
		남자와 결혼한 거야
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	Can you help me with this clasp?
		이거 좀 풀어줄래?
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	Claire?
		클레어?
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	Honey?
		여보?
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	No. Don't cry.
		안돼, 울지마
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	I-I can, -
		I can keep it if you want.
		자기가 원하면 가질게
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	I-I can't return it anyway.
		I already dented it.
		어차피 반품도 못해
		찌그러뜨렸거든
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	No, it's not that.
		It's -- it's not.
		아냐 그런게 아냐
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	It's just all of this.
		I'm so stressed.
		모든 게 다
		너무 스트레스야
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:23	Phil, I've never
		been a boss before,
		필, 난 사장이 되어본 적이 없다구
00:18:25	 
		 
00:18:25	and I am freaking out.
		미쳐버릴 것 같아
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	But you've been handled it
		so well.
		하지만 당신 너무 잘 해내고 있는데
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	I am faking it, Phil.
		I have no idea what I'm doing.
		그런 척 하는 거야 필
		내가 뭘 하는지 하나도 모르겠어
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	I'm just copying my dad --
		아빠 흉내만 내는 거야
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	The steak, the scotch,
		the cigars.
		스테이크, 스카치, 시가
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	Do you have any idea
		how bad the heartburn is?
		속이 얼마나 쓰린지 알아?
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	But you just got here.
		Give it a little time.
		이제 시작한 거잖아
		조금 더 기다려봐
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	There is no time.
		I'm in charge now.
		그럴 시간 없어
		난 책임자야
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	And I live every day
		in constant fear
		매일 매일을
		내가 사기꾼이라는 걸
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	of everyone discovering
		that I'm a fraud.
		누군가 알아낼까봐 두려워
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	My god, I really am
		a powerful white male!
		맙소사 나 정말 백인남성 지배층이잖아
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	Hey, you are not a fraud.
		당신은 사기꾼 같은 거 아냐
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:48	I haven't had the guts to sit
		at my dad's desk since he left.
		나 아직 아빠 자리에 앉지도 못했어
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	I still feel
		like the little girl
		아직도 어린 애 같아
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:55	who used to play
		hide-and-seek under it.
		저 아래에서 숨바꼭질이나 하던
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:58	Look.
		봐
00:18:59	 
		 
00:19:00	This is your desk now.
		여기가 당신 책상이야
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	You've earned it.
		당신이 얻어낸 거야
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	You are not
		a little girl anymore.
		당신은 더이상 어린 아이가 아냐
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:08	In fact, you're the strongest,
		당신은 내가 아는
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	smartest woman I know.
		가장 강하고 현명한 여자야
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:14	The hardest company in the world
		to run is Dunphy Co.,
		세상에서 제일 운영하기 어려운 
		기업은 던피 주식회사야
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	and you've kept us in business
		for 22 years.
		당신이 22년간이나 안 망하고 지켜냈잖아
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	I don't worry about you
		in this job.
		난 당신이 이 일하는 거 하나도 걱정 안돼
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	I worry about the poor chump
		who has to follow you.
		당신 뒤에 있는 사람들이 불쌍하지
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:24	Margaret: Everyone is here
		for your meeting, Claire.
		다들 회의 기다리세요, 클레어
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:27	Knock 'em dead, boss.
		본때를 보여줘
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	Phil, wait.
		필, 기다려
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	Sorry.
		미안해
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:32	Thank you...
		고마워
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:35	for everything.
		전부 다
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	Thank you.
		고마워
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	And I'm sorry
		if I don't say it more.
		더 말하지 못해서 미안해
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	Come here.
		미안해
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	I guess you want to get rolling
		on your meeting.
		당신이 회의를 잘 '굴렸으면' 좋겠어
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	 
		음
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:45	I'll just duck out.
		난 그냥 피해있을게
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	- Take it.
		- Thank you.
		- 가져
		- 고마워
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:53	Claire?
		클레어?
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:56	I love you.
		사랑해
00:19:58	 
		 
00:20:12	Okay, Margaret.
		됐어요 마가렛
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	Phil: No, no, no, no, no,
		let me spin!
		아뇨 아뇨 아뇨
		그냥 돌게 놔둬요
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	It's worse you try to help.
		도와주려하면 더 나빠져요
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	Send them in.
		들여보내요
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:36	Phil?
		필?
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	No, not again.
		아, 안돼 또야
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:47	Should we wake him up?
		깨워야 해요?
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:49	I read the instructions.
		아니 설명서 읽어봤는데
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	It says not to.
		그러지 말래
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:54	Hello.
		여보세요
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	What?
		네?
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	Don't worry.
		I'm a realtor.
		걱정마세요
		제가 부동사업자입니다
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	I'll be right there.
		바로 가겠습니다
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:05	I have a really early meeting.
		난 아침 일찍 회의가 있어서
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	- I'm on it.
		- Thank you.
		- 제가 할게요
		- 고마워
