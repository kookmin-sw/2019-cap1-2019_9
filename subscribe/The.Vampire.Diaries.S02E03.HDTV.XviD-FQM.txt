00:00:00	Previously on
		"the vampire diaries"...
		지난이야기
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	For over a century I
		have lived in secret. Until now.
		한 세기를 걸쳐
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	I know the risk,
		and I have to know her.
		위험한 건 알지만
		알아야만 한다
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	-What are you?
		-I'm a vampire.
		- 정체가 뭐니?
		- 뱀파이어야
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	Tell me about your ex.
		Katherine?
		네 전 여친
		캐더린에 대해 말해줘
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	She broke your heart.
		네 마음을 아프게 했다고
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	That was
		a long time ago.
		오래전 일이야
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	Why do I look like her?
		왜 그녀와 닮은 거지?
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:16	What's your problem?
		뭐가 문제야?
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	I don't know. Ok?
		모르겠어
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	So, the black sheep returns.
		검은 양이 돌아오셨군
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	-Tyler?
		-Who's the guy with Caroline?
		- 타일러?
		- 캐롤라인과 있는 남자는 누구죠?
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	Mason lockwood.
		메이슨 락우드라네
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	I think the lockwoods
		have a family secret.
		락우드가 집안에
		비밀이 있는거 같아
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	They're not vampires.
		They're something else.
		뱀파이어도 아냐
		뭔가 다른 존재지
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	I love Stefan. It's
		always going to be Stefan.
		스테판을 사랑해요
		늘 스테판 뿐이라구요
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	No, Damon. Stop it!
		아니, 데이먼
		멈춰!
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:35	It's katherine. She undid
		everything that was good about him.
		캐더린이야. 데이먼을
		원래대로 돌려놨어
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	I hate him, Stefan.
		데이먼이 미워, 스테판
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:40	I've had her blood. Katherine
		obviously killed her.
		내 피를 먹였지
		캐더린이 죽인거고
00:00:44	 
		 
00:00:44	A plus b equals...
		A와 B를 더하면
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:46	I'm starving.
		배고프니까
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:49	Thanks for coming, ric.
		와줘서 고맙네
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:52	You need something to drink?
		Coffee? Bourbon?
		마실거 필요한가?
		커피? 위스키?
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Bourbon in your coffee?
		커피에 위스키 넣을까?
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	Elena mentioned
		you needed my help.
		엘레나가 그러길
		내 도움이 필요하다고
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	Yeah. We were hoping
		you could help shed some light
		락우드가에 대해서
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:00	On the lockwood family.
		조금 알려주실 수 있나 해서요
00:01:03	 
		 
00:01:11	Now, why would I know
		anything about the lockwoods?
		락우드가에 대해
		내가 뭘 알겠나?
00:01:13	 
		 
00:01:13	Well, you wouldn't.
		But your dead...
		당신은 모르겠지
		하지만 죽은
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:16	Not dead
		vampire wife might.
		아니 죽지 않은
		뱀파이어 아내는 알겠지
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	Isobel's research, from when
		you guys were at duke together.
		듀크대에 같이 재학중일때
		이자벨이 연구를 했죠
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	You said that she had spent
		years researching this town.
		이 동네에 대해
		몇년간 조사를 했다고 하셨죠
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:25	Isobel's research here...
		mystic falls...
		미스틱 폴즈에 대한
		이자벨의 연구..
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	Was rooted
		in folklore and legend.
		민간전승과 전설에서
		기원된 거였지
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	At the time, I thought
		most of which was fiction.
		그 때 나는 다 허구로만 생각했어
00:01:35	 
		 
00:01:35	Like that amazing
		vampire story.
		기막힌 뱀파이어 이야기처럼
00:01:36	 
		 
00:01:36	Aside from vampires,
		what else?
		뱀파이어 말고
		또 뭐가 있죠?
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	Lycanthrope.
		이리
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:43	Wait. Like werewolves?
		늑대인간 같은거 말인가요?
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:46	No way. Impossible.
		Way too lon chaney.
		말도 안돼. 불가능해
		너무 론 채니 같잖아
		(괴기물의 대표적 배우)
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:49	Is it?
		그런가요?
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:51	I've been on this planet
		160-some odd years.
		난 이 지구에
		160년 넘게 살았지만
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	I've never come across one.
		이리를 마주친 적은
		한번도 없었다구
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:55	If werewolves exist,
		where the hell are they?
		늑대인간이 존재하면
		대체 어디 있는거지?
00:01:59	 
		 
00:02:12	Ric: Well, why do you
		suspect the lockwoods?
		락우드가를 왜 의심하는 건가?
00:02:15	 
		 
00:02:15	Because vervain didn't effect
		the mayor on founder's day
		설립일날 시장님한테
		마편초가 먹히지 않았어
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:17	But the gilbert device did.
		길버트가 장치 때문에
		쓰러지긴 했지만
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:19	And it effected
		his son Tyler.
		아들 타일러도 쓰러졌구
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:20	Stefan: And at the school
		carnival, his uncle mason exhibited
		학교 축제 때
		삼촌 메이슨은
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:23	Inhuman behavior when he fought
		one of the carnival workers.
		축제 봉사활동원과 싸우다가
		초인적인 행동을 보였어요
00:02:27	 
		 
00:02:31	It suggested some sort
		of a supernatural entity.
		뭔가 초자연적 존재임을 암시하죠
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	We were hoping
		that isobel's research
		이자벨의 연구를 통해
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:36	Could help us figure
		out what it is.
		무엇인지 밝혀낼 수 있길 바랬어요
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	A lot of her things are
		still at duke.
		그녀의 조사 자료는
		듀크대에 보관되어 있네
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:41	I mean,
		her office is still there.
		아직도 연구실이 남아있다네
00:02:42	 
		 
00:02:42	She's technically
		still missing.
		아직 행방불명 상태니까
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:45	So can we get
		access to it?
		연구자료를
		볼 수 있을까?
00:02:47	 
		 
00:03:06	Ric, we need to know
		what we're dealing with.
		릭, 우리가 대면하는 상대가
		누군지 알아야 해
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	If this wolfman thing
		is true,
		늑대인간이 사실이라면
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	I've seen enough movies
		to know it's not good.
		좋지 않다는 건
		영화를 많이 봐서 알거든
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:22	It means that mason lockwood
		is a real-life lon chaney.
		메이슨 락우드가
		현실의 공포 캐릭터란 거군
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	At that little Tyler punk may
		just very well be lon chaney jr.
		그 타일러 녀석은
		늑대인간 2세가 될테고
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	Which means bela
		lugosi... meaning me...
		그 말은.. 벨라 루고시
		그러니까 나는
		(뱀파이어 백작 역할)
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	Is totally screwed.
		완전 망했다는 거고

00:03:50	Caroline?
		캐롤라인?
00:03:52	 
		 
00:04:00	Caroline?
		캐롤라인?
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:15	Hey, I thought you said
		you were at home.
		집에 있다는 줄 알았는데
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	Tyler's doing a whole thing
		at the swimming hole.
		타일러가 강에서 파티를 연대
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	And I wanted us
		to spend the day together.
		같이 갈 수 없을까 해서
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	Where are you? Call me.
		어디 있니?
		전화줘
00:04:25	 
		 
00:04:29	You sure
		you want to do this?
		정말 하고 싶어?
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	Which part?
		어떤 거?
00:04:32	 
		 
00:04:32	Digging through my
		birth mother's lifework
		내 생모의 평생의 업적을
		캐내는 거?
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	Or going to duke
		with Damon?
		아니면 데이먼과
		듀크대에 가는거?
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	Either. Both.
		하나만
		둘 다일수도 있고
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:40	Well, I'm sure
		about the first part.
		첫번째 건 확실해
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	But then again,
		ric is a good buffer.
		생각해보니 릭 선생님이
		방패역할을 해주지
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	So we can bond in
		our anti-Damon solidarity.
		그러니까 우리 끼리
		안티데이먼 연대로 결속할 수 있겠어
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:52	I wish you were
		coming, though.
		너도 가면 좋을텐데
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	You know what, maybe we should
		wait a couple of days, huh?
		며칠 기다리는 게 어때?
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	Wait till Caroline's
		less of a danger,
		캐롤라인이 덜 위험해지면
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	And then I can go with you.
		같이 가자
00:05:01	 
		 
00:05:01	It's ok that
		I'm going, right?
		괜찮아 갈게
00:05:03	 
		 
00:05:03	And be honest. Because if it's
		not then I can just stay here.
		정직하게 말해줘
		싫다면 그냥 여기 있을게
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	And we can take care
		of Caroline.
		캐롤라인 같이 봐주자
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	No, listen.
		I want you to go. Ok? I do.
		아니
		가길 원해
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	You have questions about your
		lineage and about katherine.
		네 집안 계보와
		캐더린에 대한 궁금증이 있잖아
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	Look, I'm not going to let
		the fact that Damon is going
		난 데이먼이 간다고 해서
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	Keep you from an opportunity
		to get some answers.
		해답을 찾는 기회를
		막게 두지 않을거야
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	You hate it, though.
		싫긴 하구나
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	I hate it.
		And I love you.
		싫긴 하지. 그리고 사랑해
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	I love you, too.
		나도야
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:28	Jenna: It's been a while.
		오랫만이네요
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	Well, school's been
		keeping me really busy.
		학교 때문에 바빴어요
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:35	I want you to know
		it means a lot to me
		정말 의미가 크단 거 알아줘요
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:37	That Elena has
		a connection to her mother.
		엘레나가 엄마와
		연관이 있다는 거
00:05:40	 
		 
00:05:40	I appreciate you bringing her
		along today.
		같이 가게 해줘서 고마워요
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	Yeah. Well,
		I figured it was time
		이번에는
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	To take care of my wife's
		things, you know?
		아내의 유품들을
		처리할 때 같았어요
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:49	Look, jenna, I know...
		제나, 알아요
00:05:52	 
		 
00:05:52	Things between you and I have
		been a little start and stop.
		우리 관계가 조금
		진전 없었던 거
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	And I'm sorry for that.
		미안해요
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:55	But maybe once I can...
		하지만 언제 한번..
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	Uh, no. Don't do that.
		그러지 마요
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Not the half, maybe apology,
		hope for the future thing.
		반쯤 사과하면서
		희망을 주는거 말이죠
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:05	Elena, you coming?
		엘레나, 안 가니?
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:11	Do what you need to do, ok?
		할 일 하세요
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:22	Hey, you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	Yeah. Just men
		and their baggage.
		응. 별 일 아냐
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:29	Sorry you can't
		come too, stef.
		넌 못 온다니 유감이군
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:35	Call me if you need anything.
		필요한 거 있음 말해
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:36	Oh, I'll take really
		good care of her.
		내가 잘 봐주마
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:47	Ok. Time to go.
		좋아. 갈 시간이다
00:06:50	 
		 
00:07:02	Have you ever been down
		to those old ruins in the woods?
		숲속 옛터로 가본적 있어요
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	The old lockwood
		estate?
		오래전 락우드가 사유지 말이냐?
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	Yeah. What do you know about it?
		네. 아시는 게 있으신가요?
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	It was the original
		plantation house.
		원래 재배지였지
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	Beautiful antebellum
		architecture.
		아름다운 남북전쟁 전의 건축이었단다
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:12	And if it hadn't
		burnt to the ground,
		바닥까지 다 타지 않았다면
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	We'd probably be
		living in it.
		그 안에 살았을거야
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:17	What's the deal with
		the freaky underground cellar?
		소름끼치는 지하실은 뭐래요?
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:21	We don't talk about
		those kind of rooms.
		그 방에 대해서는
		얘기 잘 안한단다
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	Why not?
		왜요?
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	Well, this is
		the south, honey.
		우리 마을은
		남부에 있잖니
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	But no one likes to reminisce
		about the old slave days.
		아무도 노예시절에 대해
		추억에 잠기고 싶어하지 않지
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:31	What are you guys
		talking about?
		무슨 얘기 하고 있었니?
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	We were just talking about
		the old lockwood property.
		예전 락우드가 소유지에 대해
		얘기 중이었어
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	Thinking about having some
		friends over to the swim hole.
		친구들 데리고 갈까 싶어서
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	Well, be careful. If anything
		happens on the property,
		조심해라. 그 곳에
		무슨 일이라도 생기면
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	The family is liable.
		우리 가족 책임이니
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	Of course.
		물론요
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:50	I don't know how to make
		a daywalking ring.
		어떻게 낮에 걸어다닐 수 있는
		반지를 만드는지 모르겠어
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	Emily made mine.
		She made Damon's, too.
		에밀리가 내껄 만들었고
		데이먼 것도 만들었어
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:55	Instructions must be
		in the grimoire.
		주문서에 설명이
		적혀있을 거야
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	Doesn't mean
		I can cast a spell.
		주문을 걸 수 있단
		보장은 없잖아
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Bonnie. Ahem.
		보니
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	You know how to drop vampires
		with a single look.
		쳐다보는 것 만으로
		뱀파이어를 쓰러뜨린다면
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	Ok? I think
		you can figure it out.
		알아낼 수 있을텐데
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	Caroline killed someone,
		Stefan.
		캐롤라인은 사람을 죽였어
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	I can't make it easier
		for her to do it again.
		더 편하게
		만들어 줄 수 없다고
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	No. We're not making it
		easier for her.
		아니. 쉽게 만들어 주는게 아냐
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	We're just giving her
		the chance to survive.
		그냥 살 수 있는 기회를 주는거지
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	Listen, everyday that she's
		cut off from her old life...
		매일 옛 인생에서
		단절된채로..
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	From you, from Elena,
		from matt...
		너나 엘레나나
		맷한테서 단절된다면
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	It'll make it that much harder
		정말 힘들거야
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	For her to hold on
		to her humanity.
		인간성을 지켜내기가
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	And how do you know
		she won't hurt anyone else?
		그럼 다른 사람을
		해치지 않을지 어떻게 알아?
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	I don't. But if we don't do
		everything we can to help her...
		몰라. 하지만 도울 방법을
		찾아내지 못하면..
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	Or at least trust the fact
		that she can keep it together,
		최소한 컨트롤 할 수 있다고
		믿을 수 없다면
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	We might as well
		just stake her right now.
		그냥 찔러 죽이는 편이 낫겠지
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	I don't know
		if I can trust her.
		캐롤라인을 못 믿겠어
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	Not with this.
		이번에는
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	Then trust me.
		그럼 날 믿어봐
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:46	How you doing back there?
		Leave her alone.
		뒤에는 어떠니?
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	You know, this whole pretending to
		hate me thing is getting a little silly.
		날 미워하는 척 하는거
		참 우스워 진다
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	I don't think
		she's pretending.
		척하는거 아닌것 같은데
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	You did kill her
		brother.
		동생을 죽였잖아
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	There is a huge asterisk
		next to that statement.
		그 주장에
		별표를 달아야 겠네
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	He came back to life.
		살아 돌아왔거든
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	Yeah. Thanks to a ring that
		you didn't know he was wearing.
		그래요. 낀 줄 몰랐던 반지 덕에 말이죠
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	Why are you so sure
		I didn't know?
		내가 몰랐다고 왜 확신하는 건데?
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	Did you?
		Yes.
		아셨나요? / 그래
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	You're lying.
		거짓말쟁이
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	Elena, I saw the ring.
		엘레나, 반지를 봤다구
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	Big tacky thing.
		크고 촌스러워서
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	It's hard to miss.
		놓치지 힘들다구
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:19	So, I don't get to choose the ring
		I have to wear the rest of my life?
		평생 끼고 살 반지를
		내가 고르는게 아니다?
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	Hey, if you don't
		want it...
		원치 않으면..
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	No. She...she wants it.
		아니.. 원한대
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:29	Now what?
		이제 뭐?
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	Now's the part
		where I explain the rules.
		규율을 말할 차례야
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	The witch who spells the ring
		has the power to de-spell it.
		반지에 주문을 거는 마녀는
		주문을 풀 능력도 있어
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	So, if you ever do anything
		to hurt anyone...
		네가 누군가를 해치면..
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	I'm not going to hurt anyone.
		아무도 해하지 않을거야
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	You're a vampire.
		넌 뱀파이어야
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	That means the urge to kill
		is a part of who you are.
		죽이고 싶은 욕구는
		네 본능이라구
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:44	The minute you let it
		take over, I will stop you.
		그 본능에 굴복하면
		내가 멈출게
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:48	Bonnie, you're supposed
		to be my friend.
		보니, 넌 내 친구라고
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	I can't ignore
		what happened. Ok?
		저번에 일어난 일을
		모른척 할 수 없어
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:53	If you want to be friends,
		you're going to have to prove
		친구가 되고 싶으면
		증명해 보여야 해
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	That the Caroline
		I remember isn't gone.
		내가 알던 캐롤라인이
		그대로 남아있다고
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:58	Now, put the ring
		on the bed.
		반지 침대에 놓아봐
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:07	Do you really think I meant to
		kill that guy at the carnival?
		축제 때 그 남자애를 내가
		일부러 죽였던 거라고 생각해?
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:11	He's still dead.
		어쨌든 죽었다구
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	Now, do you want me
		to cast the spell or not?
		주문 걸어줄까 말까?
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	Hmm?
		 
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:41	All done.
		다 됐어
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:47	Um.
		 
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:50	So, that's it?
		그게 끝이야?
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	I mean,
		nothing witchy happened.
		마녀같은 일은
		하나도 안 생겼네
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	You know, no flickering lights,
		no gust of wind.
		불이 번쩍인다든가
		돌풍이 부는 거 말야
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	Have you even done this before?
		Caroline...
		이거 해본적 있니?
		캐롤라인..
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Well, I just want
		to make sure I worked!
		난 효과가 있는지만
		알고 싶다구!
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:06	It worked.
		주문이 먹혔군
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	what if it hadn't,
		bonnie?!
		잘 안 됐으면 어쩔려고?
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	She's all yours.
		이제 네가 맡아
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:26	So isobel was officially employed
		by the anthropology department
		이자벨은 공식적으로
		인류학과에 채용됐어
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	Given that most paranormal
		phenomena is rooted in folklore.
		과학적으로 알수 없는 현상은
		민간전승에 기원된 것이니까
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:36	Excuse me.
		Hi, I'm alaric saltzman.
		실례합니다
		알라릭 살츠만이에요
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	I called earlier.
		Yes. Of course.
		- 요전에 전화했어요
		- 물론요
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	I'm vanessa monroe,
		research assistant...
		바네사 먼로에요
		보조 연구원요
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	Comparative folklore.
		비교 민간전승 분야 말이죠
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	Uh, let me just grab
		isobel's keys.
		이자벨 열쇠 가져올게요
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	I'm sorry. These are my
		friends Elena and Damon.
		미안해요. 제 친구
		엘레나와 데이먼이에요
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	I hope this isn't too
		much of an imposition.
		부담이 되지 않길 바라요
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	Please. Isobel's office
		is right through there.
		뭘요. 이자벨 연구실은
		바로 저쪽에 있어요
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	Isobel was one of
		my first professors.
		이자벨은 제 첫 교수분이셨죠
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	I'm a grad student.
		She was brilliant.
		대학원생이에요
		정말 대단한 분이셨죠
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	One of the reasons
		I went into folklore.
		민간전승에 빠진
		이유중 하나죠
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	I have to ask...
		물어봐야 겠어요
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	Has there been any news?
		소식 없으셨나요?
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	No. No. I'm afraid not.
		안타깝게 없었습니다
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	It's right this way.
		바로 이쪽이에요
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:26	I'll grab the light.
		Feel free to look around.
		불 켜 드릴게요
		맘껏 둘러보세요
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	It's fascinating, isn't it?
		신기하죠?
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:40	Where'd she go?
		어디 갔지?
00:12:44	 
		 
00:13:03	Pull it out.
		I can't reach it, Elena.
		빼주렴
		내 손이 안 닿잖니
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	Just pull the damn
		thing out. It hurts.
		그냥 빼라고
		아파 죽겠다
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:20	That bitch is dead.
		저 년 죽었어
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	Uh, you're not going
		to kill her.
		죽이면 안되요
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	Watch me.
		어디 봐라
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	You touch her and I swear I
		will never speak to you again.
		건드리면 맹세컨데
		당신과 다시 말 안할거에요
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	What makes you think
		that has any power over me?
		무슨 생각으로
		날 말리려는 거야?
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	'cause I took an arrow
		in the back for you?
		등의 화살을
		빼줬으니깐?
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	You are severely
		overestimating yourself.
		심각하게 자신을
		과대평가 하는군
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	Right. I forgot that I was
		speaking to a psychotic mind
		좋아요. 깜박 잊었네요
		내가 말하는건
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	Who snaps and kills people
		impulsively.
		사람을 본능적으로 죽이는
		정신나간 마음에 한 얘기란걸
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	Fine. Go ahead.
		Do whatever you want.
		좋아요. 계속해요
		원하는대로요
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	You're trying to manipulate me.
		날 조종하려는 군
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	If by "manipulate"
		you mean tell the truth, ok.
		조종이라는 게
		사실을 말하는거면, 그렇죠
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:52	Guilty.
		죄책감 느껴요
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:57	Ok.
		알았어요
00:13:59	 
		 
00:14:01	Please! Ok. I freaked.
		그만 하세요
		깜짝 놀랐다구요
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	All right, you would have done
		the same thing. It is not possible!
		당신이라도 똑같은 일을 했을거에요
		불가능 하다구요!
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	Katherine pierce can't be alive.
		캐더린 피어스는
		살아있을 수 없어요
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	And Damon salvatore
		died in 1864.
		데이먼 살바토어는
		1864년에 죽었구요
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	Ok. I read isobel's research.
		이자벨의 연구자료를 읽어보게
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	Well, then you should know
		just how possible this is.
		그럼 얼마나
		가능한지 알거네
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:25	I'm Elena gilbert,
		isobel's daughter
		엘레나 길버트에요
		이자벨의 딸이죠
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	And a descendent
		of katherine pierce.
		캐더린 피어스의
		후손이구요
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:34	And this is Damon salvatore,
		who you just shot.
		이쪽은 방금 화살을 맞은
		데이먼 살바토어
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	I'd be extra nice to me
		right now.
		나라면 극도로 친절하게 대할거야
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:39	Look. We need your help.
		도움이 필요해요
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	Ok. We need to see
		all of isobel's research,
		이자벨 연구자료들을 다 봐야 해요
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	Anything related
		to mystic falls.
		미스틱 폴즈에
		연관된 모든건요
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:49	So what do I do
		when I see the rabbit?
		토끼를 보면 뭘 해야 한다구?
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	Chase it, catch it,
		feed on it.
		쫓아가서 잡고 피를 빨아
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:53	Isn't killing cute,
		defenseless animals
		귀여운 무방비의 동물을 죽이면
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	The first step in becoming
		a serial killer?
		연쇄 살인범이 되는
		첫걸음이 아닐까?
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:58	Well, you sort of skipped serial
		killer and went straight to vampire.
		연쇄 살인범 단계는 넘어가고
		바로 뱀파이어가 되버린거지
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	Hey, Caroline, if you're not serious
		about all this, I think you should tell me.
		캐롤라인, 심각하게
		생각치 않으면 말해줘
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	No. I am.
		아니. 심각하다구
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	Look, I swear that I am!
		Ok. But it's just...
		진지하게 생각한단거 약속해!
		하지만 그게..
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	I haven't been
		in the sun for days.
		난 며칠간 햇빛을 못 봤어
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	And everyone's at
		the swimming hole having fun,
		모두들 강가에서
		즐겁게 놀구 있다구
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	And matt is there. And he
		finally told me that he loved me.
		맷도 거기 갔구
		마침내 날 사랑한댔는데
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	But I've been blowing him off.
		난 계속 퇴짜만 놨고
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	And now you
		want me to eat bunnies.
		토끼를 먹으란 거 알아
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	And I'm kinda freaking out, ok?!
		난 약간 무서워 죽겠다고
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	Whew.
		 
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:25	And now you're laughing at me.
		이제 비웃는 구나
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	No. No. I'm not laughing. None
		of this is funny, trust me.
		아니. 웃는게 아냐
		다 재미 없어
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	It's just that, uh...
		그저..
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:34	What?!
		뭐?
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	When somebody
		becomes a vampire,
		뱀파이어가 되면
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	All their natural behaviors
		get sort of amplified.
		천성적인 버릇이
		증폭되거든
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	What do you mean?
		무슨 말이야?
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	I mean, as a human I cared deeply
		for people and how they felt.
		인간일때 난 사람들을 아끼고
		사람들의 생각을 걱정했지
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	If they were hurting,
		I felt their pain.
		아파하면
		고통을 느꼈어
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	And I felt guilty if I was
		the one that caused it.
		내가 원인인냥
		죄책감을 느꼈지
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	And as a vampire,
		뱀파이어로
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	All of that got...
		그런 버릇은..
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:57	Magnified.
		증폭이 됐어
00:15:59	 
		 
00:16:02	So you're saying that
		now I'm basically an insecure,
		그러니까 난 이제 불안하고
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	Neurotic,
		control freak on crack.
		신경질적인 면이
		마약한 것 처럼 증폭된단 거구나
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	Well, I wasn't gonna
		say it like that.
		그런 말 하려는게 아녔어
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	But...
		하지만..
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	Hey, listen.
		Let's hunt. Ok?
		들어봐
		같이 사냥 하자
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	And then after that,
		그 후에는
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	We'll go to
		the swimming hole.
		강가에 가보자
00:16:21	 
		 
00:16:21	Really?!
		Yeah.
		- 정말?
		- 그래
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	Matt is the closet
		connection
		맷은 네게 인간성을 잃지 않게
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	That you have
		to your humanity.
		도와주는 사람이니
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	And I think that being
		around him is a good thing.
		그 곁에 있을수록
		좋은 거야
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Ok!
		좋아
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	Come on.
		어서 가자
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	Ok.
		좋아
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	Bunnies.
		토끼들아
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	This box tracks katherine's
		arrival to mystic falls
		이 상자에는
		1864년 4월
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	In April of 1864.
		캐더린의 등장을
		추적한 자료들이 담겨있죠
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	Is that all
		there is about her?
		이 모든게
		캐더린에 관한건가요?
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	All that I'm aware of.
		내가 알기론 그래요
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:49	Here.
		여기요
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:52	Take this.
		이거 받아요
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:55	Does vervain really work?
		마편초가 효과 있나요?
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	Nope! Not at all.
		아니. 전혀
00:16:58	 
		 
00:17:00	Can he hear us?
		우리 말 들을 수 있어요?
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	no!
		That would be creepy!
		아니!
		그럼 소름 끼치겠다
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	Can he read minds, too?
		마음도 읽을 수 있어요?
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	You know, if you want
		to see me naked,
		있지, 나 벗은 몸 보고 싶으면
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	All you have
		to do is ask.
		그냥 부탁만 해
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	No. That, he can't do.
		아니요
		마음 읽는 건 못해요
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	He is very capable of being
		a first rate jackass.
		재수없게 구는건 1등이죠
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:32	Is it me, or did
		amy bradley's ass get hot?
		에이미 브래들리 엉덩이가
		갈수록 섹시해지는건 내 생각인가?
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	All class.
		전교생이 알지
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Where's forbes?
		I wish I knew.
		- 캐롤라인은?
		- 모르겠다
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	You guys
		on the outs already?
		둘이 벌써 헤어진거야?
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	No. We're fine. I'm fine.
		아니. 괜찮아
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	Just not sure what she is.
		어디 있는지 모를뿐이지
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:47	What's your uncle
		doing here?
		네 삼촌은 왠 일이래?
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:52	You busting us,
		or you joining us?
		우리 쫓아내게?
		아님 합류하게?
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	Neither.
		둘 다 아냐
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	Hoping you can make sure
		everyone's out of here by dark.
		어두워지기 전에
		보내도록 해라
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	What happens after dark?
		어두워지면 어떻게 되길래?
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	Someone ends up
		wasted and dead
		술에 취해 죽은 사람이
		나올지 몰라
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	At the bottom of the lake.
		호수 안에서 말이지
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	You heard your mom. The family's
		liable if anything happens.
		엄마 얘기 들었지
		일 생기면 우리 가족 책임이라고
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	Don't be a party killer.
		파티 분위기 망치지 마
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	Hey, I didn't say
		you had to stop partying.
		파티 멈추란 게 아냐
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	I just said you have
		to take it elsewhere.
		그냥 다른데서 하라구
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	All right.
		알았어
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	We'll be out of here.
		곧 나갈게
00:18:15	 
		 
00:18:27	Why are you looking at him
		with your serious vampire look?
		왜 진지한 뱀파이어 표정으로
		쳐다보는 거야?
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	My what?
		My "serious vampire look"?
		뭐? 내 진지한 뱀파이어 표정?
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	Mm-hmm. I mean, it's different
		from your worried vampire look.
		걱정된 표정하고 달라
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	Neither of which stray
		too far from your
		그 둘은
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	"hey, it's Tuesday" look.
		'화요일이네' 표정과
		별 차이가 없지
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	Oh. I get it. Ok.
		알았어
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	You think I'm, uh,
		you think I'm too serious.
		내가 너무 진지하단 거구나
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	I mean, I wasn't going
		to say it like that. But...
		그런 말 하려는 건 아녔는데..
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:51	Hey, amy.
		에이미
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:54	You know, you're missing
		all the fun in the water.
		물 속의 재미를
		놓치고 있구나
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	Ah, not waterproof.
		방수가 안 돼서
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Too bad.
		안됐네
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	So, there's a full moon tonight.
		보름달 뜬다는데
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	We gonna light a fire later
		and tell ghost stories?
		좀 있다 불 지피면서
		귀신 얘기 하지 않을래?
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Uh, I don't know.
		모르겠다
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:06	Matt.
		맷
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	What the hell?
		I've been calling you.
		대체 뭐야?
		계속 전화했잖아
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	I know, I got held up.
		But I'm here now.
		알아. 일이 생겨서
		이제 왔잖아
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	Hey, Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:14	Go find somebody single
		to stalk, amy.
		여친 없는 남자나 찾아봐, 에이미
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:21	Seriously?
		진짜?
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	She was flirting with you.
		너한테 꼬리치던데
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	She's harmless. You
		don't have to be rude.
		다른 의도 없었어
		무례하게 굴 필요 없잖아
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	You're mad?
		화났니?
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	You've been dodging
		my calls all day.
		내 전화 계속 피했잖아
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	And you get to show up here
		and be the jealous girlfriend?
		그러더니 갑자기 나타나
		샘난 여자친구 행세를 해?
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	It's kinda lame, care.
		유치하다구
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:38	Hey, I saw that.
		You compelled her.
		에이미한테
		주문 거는거 봤어
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	Yeah,
		she deserved it.
		응. 그래도 쌌으니까
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	Caroline, nobody deserves to
		have their mind messed with for...
		캐롤라인, 아무나 그렇게
		주문을 걸면 안돼
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	Shallow reasons.
		피상적인 이유로 인해 말이지
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	You know, why is everyone
		sticking up for
		왜 다들
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	Amy freaking bradley?
		얄미운 에이미 편만 드는거야?
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:50	You're letting your jealousy
		get the best of you.
		질투심에 사로잡혔잖아
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	Oh, so now I have magnified
		jealousy issues too.
		이제 질투심 문제도 증폭되고 있구나
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	That's great.
		대단한걸
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	I told you this wasn't
		going to be easy.
		쉽지 않을거랬지
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Yeah, well. Might as well
		have stayed dead.
		그냥 죽는 편이 낫았겠어
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	My entire personality
		is killing me.
		내 성질 때문에 죽겠다
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:07	Shut up.
		입 다물어
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:15	Any luck?
		뭐 찾은 거 없니?
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	There's nothing in here about
		katherine that we don't already know.
		우리가 모르던 사실은 없어요
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	ah, man.
		그래
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	You know, it's a bummer
		we're not friends anymore.
		더이상 우린 친구가
		아니라니 참 안타깝군
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	Because I can tell you
		what I know.
		내가 알아낸 걸
		말해줄 수 있는데
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:27	Now who's manipulating who?
		이젠 누가 누굴 조종하는 거죠?
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	Hey, guys. Check this out.
		여러분, 이것 좀 보게
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:37	There's no record of werewolf
		mythology in mystic falls.
		미스틱 폴즈에
		늑대인간에 대한 기록은 없지만
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	But here are some records of
		some of the lesser known legends.
		덜 알려진 전설 기록이 있어요
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	Everything from scandinavian
		skinwalkers to the [indistinct].
		북유럽 스킨워커족부터
		불분명한 전설까지
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:51	Which roughly
		translates into
		이 모든 건 개략적으로
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	"the curse
		of the sun and moon."
		"해와 달의 저주"로 불리죠
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	It's native american.
		인디언 전설이군
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Aztec.
		아즈텍요
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	It explains one origin of the
		werewolf curse traced through virginia.
		버지니아로 추정되는 곳에서
		늑대인간의 저주의 기원을 설명해요
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	The short story...
		600 years ago,
		단편 소설인데
		600년 전
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	The aztecs were plagued
		by werewolves and vampires.
		아즈텍 사람들이 늑대인간과
		뱀파이어의 습격을 받아서
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	They terrorized the countryside,
		시골이 황폐화되고
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	Made farming
		and hunting impossible.
		농업과 사냥이
		불가능해졌죠
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	Until an aztec shaman
		cursed them,
		결국 아즈텍의 무당이
		저주를 내려
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	Making vampires slaves to the sun
		and werewolves servants of the moon.
		뱀파이어는 태양빛의 노예로
		늑대인간은 달빛의 부하로 만들었죠
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:19	As a result, vampires could
		only prowl at night,
		결과적으로 뱀파이어는
		밤에만 배회할수 있고
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	And werewolves could only
		turn on a full moon.
		늑대인간은 오로지
		보름달에만 나타나게 됐죠
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:24	When the full moon crests
		in the sky,
		하지만 하늘에
		보름달이 뜨면
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:26	Whosever unlucky enough to fall under
		the werewolf curse turns into a wolf.
		늑대인간의 저주에 걸린 불행한 이는
		늑대로 변하게 되죠
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:32	Can they control
		the transformation?
		변이를 통제할 수 있나?
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	If it were a choice,
		it wouldn't be called a curse.
		선택권이 있다면
		저주라 부르지 않았겠죠
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:43	Werewolves will attack humans.
		늑대인간은
		인간을 공격할 수 있어요
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	But instinct
		and centuries of rivalry
		하지만 본능과
		경쟁의 세기들로 인해
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	Have hardwired them
		to hunt their prey of choice...
		선택한 먹이가 바뀌었죠
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	Vampires.
		뱀파이어로요
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:56	Well...
		그럼..
00:21:59	 
		 
00:21:59	If werewolves are hunting
		vampires, I would know about it.
		늑대인간이 뱀파이어를
		쫓는다면 알았을텐데
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	Not if there aren't
		that many werewolves left alive.
		살아있는 늑대인간이
		얼마 없었죠
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	Hundreds of years ago, vampires
		hunted them almost to extinction.
		몇백년 전에 뱀파이어들이
		그들을 거의 절멸시켰으니까요
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	Why would they do that?
		왜 그런거지?
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	To protect themselves.
		자신들을 보호하려구요
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	Legend has it that a werewolf
		bite is fatal to vampires.
		전설에 의하면 늑대인간에 물리는건
		뱀파이어한테 치명적이래요
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:30	Come on, guys. Tyler wants
		everyone out of here.
		어서. 타일러가
		다들 여기서 나가래
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:33	Gotta move the party.
		파티 장소 옮겨야 겠어
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:39	He's mad at me.
		나한테 화났어
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:44	Go talk to him.
		가서 얘기해 봐
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:47	I'll wait.
		기다릴게
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:53	Hey.
		여보세요
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:54	Hi. Listen. We've
		learned some stuff here.
		있지. 연구실에서
		많은 걸 알게 됐어
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	And I know it's
		going to sound crazy.
		이상한 소리로 들릴지 몰라
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	But I wanted
		to fill you in.
		하지만 너한테도
		알려주고 싶었어
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:00	What's up?
		뭔데?
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:09	Still mad?
		아직도 화났어?
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:11	I thought we were past all
		this insecurity stuff, Caroline.
		불안한 단계는
		다 끝난줄 알았는데
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:14	I told you
		how I felt about you.
		네게 내 감정을 얘기했잖아
00:23:16	 
		 
00:23:16	What more do you need?
		뭐가 더 필요한건데?
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	Nothing. Nothing.
		아무것도 필요 없어
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	I...I don't need anything else.
		다른 건 아무것도
00:23:23	 
		 
00:23:23	I'm sorry, matt.
		I'm so sorry.
		미안해
		정말로
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	I'm so, so, so, so sorry.
		정말 정말 미안해
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	I'm not kidding. I'm not
		going to put up with the drama.
		농담 아냐. 난 드라마 같은
		오버는 참아내지 않을거야
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	No. No more drama.
		더이상 안 그럴게
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	Just...I promise...just.
		약속할게.. 그냥..
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:45	I don't know what it means
		or if we should even believe it.
		무슨 뜻인지
		뭘 믿어야 하는지 모르겠어
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	But it's a full moon, Stefan.
		보름달이야
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:50	After what you saw
		mason lockwood do...
		메이슨 락우드가
		어떤 능력이 있는지 보고 나서..
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	I'll be careful.
		조심해야 할거야
00:23:53	 
		 
00:23:53	There's one more thing.
		한 가지 더 있어
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	What is it?
		뭔데?
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:55	According to the legend,
		전설에 의하면
00:23:57	 
		 
00:23:57	A werewolf bite
		can kill a vampire.
		뱀파이어가 늑대인간에 물리면
		죽을 수 있대
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:07	Listen, I gotta go.
		있지, 가야겠어
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:09	I'll see you
		when you get home. Ok?
		집에 가서 보자
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	Ok.
		알았어
00:24:12	 
		 
00:25:05	Wait,
		what is this place?
		잠깐. 여기가 어디야?
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:11	Not much farther, amy.
		별로 안 먼 곳이야
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	Really, Tyler? You drag me
		all the way out here?
		정말? 날 여기까지
		끌고 온거야?
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	I had to move the party.
		So I'm moving the party.
		파티 장소를 옮겨야 해서
		옮기는 거야
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	Where are we going?
		어디 가는건데?
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	It's right around this tree.
		바로 이 나무 근처야
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	Are you sure?
		정말?
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	Oh, yeah. Come on.
		응. 이리 와
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	Ok.
		좋아
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	What is this place?
		여기 어디야?
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	It's a room buried underneath
		my family's old estate.
		우리 가문의 사유지 아래
		묻혀있는 방
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:34	No one will know
		we're down here.
		우리가 이 아래 있는건
		아무도 모를거야
00:25:36	 
		 
00:25:36	Is everyone else coming?
		다른 사람들도 오는거야?
00:25:38	 
		 
00:25:38	Yeah. Unless you rather
		I tell them not to.
		응. 오지 않길 바라면
		안 말할게
00:25:42	 
		 
00:25:42	You're single, right?
		너 여친 없지?
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:44	Oh, yeah.
		그럼
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:46	Let's go.
		어서 가자
00:25:48	 
		 
00:27:01	Have you done any research
		on doppelgangers?
		도플갱어에 관한
		연구도 하셨나요?
00:27:04	 
		 
00:27:04	Well, the word means a lot of
		different things to different cultures.
		그 단어는 다양한 문화권에
		다양한 의미가 있죠
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	But typically a doppelganger
		하지만 보통 도플갱어란
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	Is a living, breathing
		double of oneself.
		살아서 숨쉬는
		이중 자아를 말하죠
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:14	Did isobel have anything that'd explain
		the link between me and katherine?
		이자벨도 나와 캐더린의
		연관성을 설명할 거리가 있나요?
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	That's all she had
		on katherine, unfortunately.
		캐더린에 대한 조사 자료는
		안타깝게도 그게 다에요
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:25	But I can tell you
		하지만 말할 수 있는건
00:27:29	 
		 
00:27:29	That doppelgangers usually
		torment the people they look like,
		도플갱어는 닮은
		당사자를 괴롭히죠
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:34	Trying to undo their lives.
		그들 인생을
		파멸하려 노력하면서요
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:37	It's not exactly uplifting.
		별로 달가운 소리는 아니죠
00:27:40	 
		 
00:27:40	And more things
		we already know.
		알아요
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	Just...I want to know
		why we look alike.
		그저 왜 닮았는지만 알고 싶어요
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:48	Head-scratcher,
		isn't it?
		황당하지?
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	Do you know something or
		are you just being yourself?
		아는게 있는 거에요
		아님 원래처럼 구는거에요?
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:54	Well, "if" I know anything, I'm not
		going to tell you, not with that attitude.
		내가 뭘 안대도, 얘기 안할거야
		그런 태도를 보인다면
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:58	That's good, Damon.
		좋아요
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	And this is coming from someone
		who wants to be my friend.
		내 친구가 되고 싶단
		사람한테 그런 말이 나오다니
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	But you know what?
		이거 알아요?
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	Friends don't
		manipulate friends.
		친구는 친구를
		조종하지 않아요
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	They help each other.
		서로 돕는거죠
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:19	Wait. Wait. No. I'm sorry.
		잠깐만. 미안해
00:28:21	 
		 
00:28:21	What's the deal? Come on.
		왜 그래?
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:25	No, no, no.
		Wait, wait, wait. I can't
		아니 잠깐만
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	I'm not into it.
		별로 하고 싶지 않아
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:29	Then why'd you come with me?
		I don't know.
		- 그럼 왜 따라온거야?
		- 모르겠어
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	I'm not even really sure
		I was flirting with you.
		너한테 작업 걸었는지도
		잘 기억이 안나
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	I like matt.
		난 맷이 좋거든
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:37	Ouch.
		아야
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	Um...Ok.
		좋아
00:28:43	 
		 
00:28:43	I'm gonna go.
		그럼.. 갈게
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	Yeah.
		Sorry!
		그래. 미안
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:49	I mean...
		그러니까..
00:28:51	 
		 
00:30:11	I trust you not to say
		anything about this to anyone.
		이런 일 아무한테도
		말하지 않았으면 좋겠어요
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	Or else Damon will
		kill me in my sleep?
		안 그럼 데이먼이
		날 잘 때 죽일거니까요?
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:17	He gave me the 411.
		경고를 했어요
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	But if you need
		anything, you can call.
		하지만 필요한 거 있으면
		전화주세요
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	Hopefully I won't have to.
		그럴 필요 없길 바라요
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	But if you do...
		하지만 혹시 모르니까
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:31	Listen, you don't want
		to get caught up in this.
		이런 일에
		얽히면 안되요
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:33	Really. It'll take over.
		정말요
		빠져나오지 못할거에요
00:30:35	 
		 
00:30:35	And it'll keep you from being
		able to live your life.
		당신 삶을 사는데
		방해가 될거에요
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:39	Isobel's
		disappearance...
		이자벨이 사라진 이유..
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	Was it related
		to her research?
		조사하던 것과
		연관이 있나요?
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	Isobel became her research.
		이자벨은 스스로를
		연구하게 되었죠
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	She wanted
		to become a vampire.
		뱀파이어가 되고 싶어했어요
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	She got her wish.
		소원을 이뤘네요
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:56	I guess that would put
		a strain on a marriage.
		결혼생활에 영향이 있었겠네요
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:02	Anyway, I was wondering what it
		would be like to come back here.
		어쨌건, 여기 돌아와보는게
		어떨지 궁금했어요
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	It's uh...
		그러니까..
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	It's ok. It's really ok.
		괜찮아요
		정말요
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:11	Feels good to...
		정말 기분 좋네요
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	Have her in my past.
		과거로 남겨두는 거
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	You know, it's...
		있죠...
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	Time to move beyond this.
		새 시작을 할 시간이죠
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:27	Here.
		여기
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:30	Allow me.
		내가 하마
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:35	You're not going to be
		able to hate me forever.
		날 영원히
		미워하진 못할거야
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	Can we just go?
		그냥 갈 수 없나요?
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:41	You didn't
		dig deep enough.
		깊게 파진 못했어
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:44	"petrova."
		페트로바
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	I saw this on the shelf.
		선반에 있는거 봤는데
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	Katherine originally
		came from europe.
		캐더린은 유럽 출신이야
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	Petrova was
		her real name.
		페트로바가 본명이지
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:53	Katharina petrova
		to be exact.
		정확히는
		캐더린 페트로바지
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	How did you know that?
		어떻게 알죠?
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	Back when, I saw it
		engraved on an old heirloom.
		오래전 유품에 새겨져 있는걸 봤거든
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	Men snoop,
		too, you know.
		남자들도 눈썰미가 있다구
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	Let me know what you
		find. Very curious myself.
		찾아낸 거 있음 알려주렴
		나도 궁금하거든
00:32:08	 
		 
00:32:10	You have every right
		to hate me.
		날 미워할 만 해
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:13	I understand.
		이해해
00:32:15	 
		 
00:32:15	You hated me before
		and we became friends.
		우리가 친구가 되기전에
		날 미워했었지
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:21	It would suck if
		that was gone forever.
		영원히 그런다면
		안타까울 거야
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:26	So...
		그럼..
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:29	Is it?
		정말 그렇니?
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	Have I lost you forever?
		영원히 널 잃은걸까?
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:35	Thank you for the book, Damon.
		책 고마워요, 데이먼
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:49	This looks
		like the spot.
		좋은 장소같네
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:52	For what?
		뭐가?
00:32:54	 
		 
00:33:00	Did you hear that?
		들려?
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:28	What are you doing?
		뭐하는거야?
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	Caroline?
		캐롤라인?
00:33:31	 
		 
00:33:36	Aah. Caroline! Caroline!
		캐롤라인!
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:40	Caroline!
		캐롤라인!
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	What the hell...your face!
		대체.. 네 얼굴이..
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:50	Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop!
		그만해!
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:55	Stop.
		멈추라고
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:58	Oh, my God.
		세상에
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:00	No, no, stop. Listen to me.
		들어봐
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:02	We need to get out
		of these woods now.
		이 숲속에서 나와야 해
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:04	We need to leave.
		[growling]
		떠나야 한다구
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:05	What was that?
		저게 뭐였어?
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	Matt, stay down.
		Do not move.
		맷, 누워있어
		움직이지 마
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:16	You and me, we're gonna run.
		너랑 나는
		도망쳐야 겠다
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	It's gonna follow us. We
		need to get it away from matt.
		그게 따라올거야
		맷한테서 떨어져 있어야 해
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:22	So, you need to run as fast as
		you can. Do you understand me?
		가능한한 빨리 뛰어야 해
		알아 듣겠어?
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	Go. Go!
		어서 도망쳐!
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:31	Wait!
		잠깐!
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:32	What is it?!
		It's a werewolf!
		- 뭐였어?
		- 늑대인간이야!
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	It will try to kill us,
		and it can.
		우릴 죽이려고 할거야
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	Hey! What are you two doing?
		둘이 뭐 하는 거야?
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:42	What are you doing?
		뭐해?
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:54	No!
		안 돼!
00:34:56	 
		 
00:35:13	 
		넌 내가 했던 일이나
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:16	Or what you saw me become.
		내가 변한 모습을
		기억 못할 것이다
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	We were just
		making out in the woods.
		우린 그저 숲속에서
		키스하고 있었어
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	And then an animal
		attacked you
		그러다가 동물이 공격을 했고
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	And bit your neck.
		네 목을 물었어
00:35:25	 
		 
00:35:25	It's weird.
		It just came out of nowhere.
		이상하다
		갑자기 튀어나왔거든
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:37	What are we going
		to do about Tyler?
		타일러는 어쩌게?
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	I took care of it.
		내가 처리했어
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	I'll get matt on vervain.
		맷한테 마편초 먹일게
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:44	It'll keep you from being
		able to compel him, but...
		주문이 먹히지 않을거고
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	Also keep you from being
		able to drink his blood.
		피도 못 마실거야
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:52	I can't believe I hurt him.
		그를 다치게 했다니
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:53	I know.
		알아
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:54	He's the one person
		on this entire planet
		이 세상에서
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	That I never wanted to hurt.
		해치고 싶지 않은
		유일한 사람이야
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:01	It's not going
		to get any easier.
		쉬워지진 않을거야
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:04	You're just going to have
		to work that much harder.
		그저 더 열심히
		컨트롤하는 법을 배워야 해
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	I shouldn't be with him,
		should I?
		그와 사귀면 안되겠지?
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:11	And if there's any danger...
		더 위험해진다면..
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	I'm the last person to make
		that kind of decision for you.
		그런 결정은
		내가 내릴 게 아냐
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	If I followed my own advice,
		내 스스로의 충고를 따랐다면
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	I would have walked away
		from Elena a long time ago.
		오래전에 엘레나를 떠났겠지
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	You ever think you should of?
		후회되지 않아?
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:23	I know I should of.
		그래
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	I just can't.
		떠날 수 없을 뿐이지
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:48	Wanna toss me those?
		그거 던져줄래?
00:36:50	 
		 
00:37:07	It was you.
		삼촌이었구나
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:18	Matt, hey.
		맷
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:20	I can't believe an animal
		attacked you.
		동물이 공격을 하다니
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:23	Yeah. There have been a lot
		of animal attacks lately.
		그래. 요즘에 야생동물의
		습격이 많았잖아
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	Well,
		are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	I've been better.
		How are you?
		나아졌어
		너는?
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	I'm ok. I'm just...
		I'm worried about you.
		괜찮아. 그저
		네가 걱정돼
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:33	I'll be fine.
		Ok.
		- 괜찮을거야
		- 좋아
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:40	Seriously, amy?
		진짜, 에이미?
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:42	We were just talking?
		우리 그냥 얘기하던 중이였어
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	Oh, is that
		what you call it?
		넌 그렇게 부르니?
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	Are you kidding me?
		농담하는 거야?
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	No, I'm not, matt.
		아니, 아냐, 맷
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	She's into you.
		And anyone can see it.
		맷은 널 좋아해
		누구든 알거라구
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	Look, I'm sorry.
		I didn't mean...
		미안해
		난..
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:51	I'm just gonna go.
		그냥 갈게
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	Knock it off.
		그만둬
00:37:56	 
		 
00:37:59	What are you doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	This isn't my fault, matt.
		Ok. She's after you.
		내 탓이 아냐
		널 따라다니잖아
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:03	And I shouldn't have
		to put up with that.
		참아낼 필요 없다구
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	I thought you said
		no more drama.
		드라마 원치 않는댔지
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:07	Well, I lied.
		거짓말 했어
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	Just forget it.
		잊어버려
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:12	Just forget
		all of it.
		다 잊어버리라구
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:16	So, what, are you, like,
		breaking up with me?
		뭐야, 나랑 헤어지겠단 거야?
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:21	Yeah.
		그래
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	Yeah. I guess
		that's what I'm doing.
		그래야겠다
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:53	Ric, I wasn't expecting
		you and Elena till later.
		릭, 늦게 올 줄 알았는데
00:38:57	 
		 
00:39:09	I should have done that
		this morning.
		아침에 할걸 그랬어요
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:19	Road trips work well for us.
		로드트립이 효과가 있었네
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	This doesn't mean
		that things are back
		그렇다고 우리 사이가
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	To the way
		they used to be, Damon.
		예전처럼 돌아온 건 아녜요
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:24	Oh, come on.
		왜 이래
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	I know I chipped a little bit
		off of your wall of hatred.
		네 증오의 벽을
		조금 허문거 아는걸
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	I need to know the truth.
		사실을 알고 싶어요
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:34	When you broke jeremy's neck,
		제레미 목을 부러뜨렸을 때
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	Did you know that
		he was wearing the ring?
		반지 낀 거 알고 있었어요?
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:41	No.
		아니
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:42	No, I didn't.
		몰랐어
00:39:44	 
		 
00:39:44	Katherine really pissed
		me off. And I snapped.
		캐더린이 열받게 해서
		나도 이성을 잃었고
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	And...
		그래서..
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:51	I got lucky
		with the ring.
		반지 때문에
		운이 좋았지
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	And I don't know what I would
		have done if he wasn't wearing it.
		안 꼈으면 내가 어찌 했을지 모르겠다
00:39:56	 
		 
00:40:00	Elena, I'm sorry.
		엘레나, 미안하다
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:05	Thank you
		for being honest with me.
		사실을 말해줘서 고마워요
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:10	And the answer to your
		question about our friendship...
		우리 우정에 관한 질문..
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	Is yes.
		대답은 예스에요
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:16	You have lost me forever.
		날 영원히 잃게 되셨어요
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:24	You knew that already,
		didn't you?
		이미 알고 있었죠?
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:28	You used me today.
		날 이용해 먹었군
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:34	You had information about
		katherine that I needed to know.
		내가 알고 싶은 캐더린에 대한
		정보를 갖고 계시잖아요
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:37	I thought friends don't
		manipulate friends.
		친구는 친구를
		속이는게 아닌줄 알았는데
00:40:39	 
		 
00:40:44	You and katherine have a lot more
		in common than just your looks.
		캐더린하고 넌 외모만이 아니라
		공통점이 많구나
00:40:48	 
		 
00:41:13	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:15	Nope. Try again.
		아니. 다시 맞춰봐
00:41:17	 
		 
00:41:19	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:41:21	 
		 
00:41:24	Don't be frightened.
		겁먹지 마
00:41:26	 
		 
00:41:26	We're going to have
		so much fun together.
		우리 둘이 정말 재미있는
		시간을 보낼거니까
