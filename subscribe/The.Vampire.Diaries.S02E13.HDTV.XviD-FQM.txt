00:00:00	Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	Vampires and werewolves used to roam
		freely until a Chaman put a curse on them,
		뱀파이어와 늑대인간들은 자유롭게
		지냈지만 무당이 저주를 걸어
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	and limit their power.
		그들의 힘을 억제했지
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	Since then, werewolves can
		only return on a full moon
		그 후로, 늑대인간은
		보름달에만 변하고
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	and vampires are weakened by the sun.
		뱀파이어는 햇빛에 약해져
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	- Elijah?
		- One of the Originals. A legend.
		- 일라이자?
		- 1세대 중 한명이야, 전설이지
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	******
		클라우스야 말로
		범접할 수 없는 존재야
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	You're saying that the oldest vampire in
		the history of time is coming after me?
		역사상 가장 오래된 뱀파이어가
		날 뒤쫓고 있단 말인가요?
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:17	- I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
		- What kind of a deal?
		- 거래를 제안하지
		- 어떤 거래요?
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	I need you to stay put and stop
		trying to get yourself killed.
		조용히 지내면서
		죽으려는 시도 하지 말게
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	Then I'll make sure that you
		and your friends remain unharmed.
		그러면 자네와 친구들을
		안전하게 지켜주겠네
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	Your call, Isobel.
		이자벨이야
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	- Did you find her?
		- Not exactly.
		- 찾았어?
		- 아직은
00:00:26	- Hello, Elena.
		- What's wrong?
		 
		- 잘 지냈니, 엘레나
		- 존 삼촌
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	The bite of a werewolf can kill a vampire,
		don't be his friend. Do you understand me?
		늑대인간한테 물리면 죽을 수 있어
		그러니까 친구되면 안된다구 알겠니?
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:34	I'm Jules.
		줄스에요
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	- I know you're a werewolf.
		- Do you know where Mason is?
		- 네가 늑대인간인거 안다
		- 메이슨이 어디 있는줄 알아요?
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	Get that, Tyler. You wanna
		know who murdered him?
		메이슨은 죽었어
		누가 죽였는지 알고싶어?
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	Your little blonde vampire did.
		네 금발머리 뱀파이어 친구가 죽였어
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	Caroline would never do that.
		캐롤라인은 절대
		그럴 애가 아녜요
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:43	She and her little vampire
		friends **** ****.
		캐롤라인과 뱀파이어 친구들이
		그 배후에 있지
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:54	Hey!
		안녕
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:57	How's it going?
		잘 있었어?
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	We need to talk.
		얘기 좀 하자
00:01:00	 
		 
00:01:02	Yeah, we do.
		그래
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	Listen...
		있지..
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:06	I've been thinking about it
		생각해봤는데
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	and I don't want to over-analize...
		너무 과하게 해석하고 싶지 않아
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:10	It was just one kiss, but...
		키스 한 번 이었지만
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:13	Not **** **** the picture
		맷이 아직
		내 곁에 있어서
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:18	We can't go there, Tyler.
		우린 안되겠어, 타일러
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:22	Fine.
		좋아
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:25	Great.
		잘됐다
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:28	That settles.
		해결됐네
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:32	What happend to my Uncle Mason?
		우리 삼촌 어떻게 된거야?
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:37	What?
		뭐?
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	He's dead and I want you to
		tell me what happened.
		어떻게 죽게 된건지 설명해봐
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:44	I... I don't...
		난.. 정말..
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:45	Then let me tell you.
		그럼 내가 말해볼까
00:01:48	 
		 
00:01:48	Stefan and his brother Damon killed him.
		스테판과 형 데이먼이 죽였지
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:51	'Cause Stefan and Damon are Vampires...
		just like you.
		스테판과 데이먼도
		너처럼 뱀파이어라서
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:56	- Who told you that?
		- Is it true?
		- 누가 그래?
		- 사실이야?
00:01:59	 
		 
00:02:00	Let me explain.
		설명할게
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:01	Did you know he was dead this whole time?
		죽은 거 여태껏 알고 있었어?
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:04	- Please.
		- Did you know?!
		- 제발
		- 알고 있었냐고?
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:11	I'm sorry, Tyler. I'm sorry.
		미안, 타일러
		미안해
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	I trusted you!
		널 믿었다구!

00:03:34	***** ***
		이런 늦었네
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	*******
		뉴스를 세번씩 보니까 늦지
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:37	- What the hell
		- Good morning to you, Jenna.
		- 이건 어떻게...
		- 굿모닝, 제나
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	Clark...
		알라릭...
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:43	It's ok I'm confused, right? Because
		we were not expecting you in like,
		혼란스러워. 난 당신이
		올거라 기대하지 않았거든
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:46	ever.
		절대로
00:03:46	ever.
		 
00:03:47	well, I got in late last
		night. Elena let me in.
		어젯밤 늦게 왔는데
		엘레나가 들여줬어
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:51	You know, I'm probably
		just gonna take off.
		있지, 그냥 나 먼저 가볼게
00:03:54	 
		 
00:04:00	I'm still confused here.
		아직도 혼란스러워
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	I decided to come back
		and stay for a while.
		돌아와서 잠시 지내기로 결정했어
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:04	Not here, you're not.
		우리 집은 안 돼. 당신은
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	Actually, you can't
		stop me from living here.
		사실, 여기서 사는걸
		막을 수도 없어
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	Actually, I can
		as legal guardian.
		사실 가능해
		법적 보호자로서
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	Yeah. About that,
		그거 말이지
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	Elena, you want me
		to explain the situation,
		엘레나, 네가 상황을 설명할래?
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	or would you like
		to do the honors?
		아님 내가 직접 할까?
00:04:16	 
		 
00:04:16	Ok. What's going on?
		무슨 일이야?
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	I'm sorry, Jenna.
		미안, 제나 이모
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:19	I should've
		told you earlier, but...
		미리 말했어야 하는데
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	I'm Elena's biological father.
		난 엘레나의
		생물학적 아빠야
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:26	There. Now you know.
		봐. 이제 알겠지?
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:38	What?
		뭐라고?
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	You brought back John Gilbert?
		존 길버트를 데려와?
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:41	That was your big
		save-Elena move?
		그게 엘레나를 구하는
		멋진 행동이었니?
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	I went to go look for Isobel,
		and I got John instead.
		이자벨 찾으러 갔다가
		대신 존을 찾았어
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	He said he could help us,
		우리를 도울 수 있대서
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:47	and we're desperate.
		필사적인 상태잖아
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	We're not that
		desperate, Stefan.
		그 정도로 필사적이진 않아
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	The guy tried to barbeque me.
		그 놈은 우릴 구워 잡수려고 했다고
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:52	Damon, Bonnie's new witch
		friend is working with Elijah,
		데이먼, 보니의 마녀 친구는
		일라이자 밑에서 일하고 있어
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	so we have to assume that the
		moonstone was never destroyed.
		그러니 월장석이 절대
		파괴되지 않은걸 알겠지
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	Elena is putting
		all of her faith
		엘레나는 모두를 지키겠다고 일라이자와
		맺은 거래에 큰 믿음을 걸고 있다구
00:04:59	 
		엘레나는 모두를 지키겠다고 일라이자와
		맺은 거래에 큰 믿음을 걸고 있다구
00:04:59	into some deal that she made
		엘레나는 모두를 지키겠다고 일라이자와
		맺은 거래에 큰 믿음을 걸고 있다구
00:05:01	 
		엘레나는 모두를 지키겠다고 일라이자와
		맺은 거래에 큰 믿음을 걸고 있다구
00:05:01	with Elijah to keep
		everyone safe.
		엘레나는 모두를 지키겠다고 일라이자와
		맺은 거래에 큰 믿음을 걸고 있다구
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	I mean, do you trust Elijah?
		넌 일라이자를 믿어?
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	I don't trust him. He's an
		original. He can't be trusted.
		아니, 1세대인데
		당연히 못 믿지
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	It's not like we can
		just go up and kill him
		그렇다고 해서
		우리가 가서 그를 죽일수 없잖아
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	because apparently,
		he can't die.
		알고 보니
		일라이자는 안 죽거든
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	Still waiting for the part
		where John Gilbert is the answer.
		존 길버트가 해답인 이유를
		기다리고 있다
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:13	He knew about the sacrifice.
		제물에 대해 알고 있었어
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:15	Isobel told him.
		이자벨이 말해줬대
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	He said he knew of a way
		to keep Elena safe.
		엘레나를 지킬 방법을 안대
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:20	And how do we do that?
		어떻게 하는 건대?
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	He's not talking, at
		least not to me, anyway.
		얘기를 안해줘
		최소한 나한테는
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:26	Great work, Stefan, top notch.
		아주 잘 하셨어
		스테판, 훌륭해
00:05:28	 
		 
00:05:28	As if I didn't have
		enough problems.
		나한테 다른 일도 많은데
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:32	Hey, I'm sorry about Rose.
		로즈 일은 유감이야
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	Whatever. I knew the woman for 5 minutes.
		됐어, 그 여자랑 안지
		5분도 안됐었는걸
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	And you cared about her
		after 5 minutes.
		5분 후에 그녀를 아끼게 됐지
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:41	Oh, wonder what that means.
		그게 무슨 의미일까
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	It means I care, Stefan.
		신경을 쓴단 거겠지
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	It means I'm changing
		and evolving into a man
		내가 변하고 있으며
		위대해질 가능성이 있는
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	capable of greatness.
		남자로 발전하고 있다는 거겠지
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:50	You better watch your back
		뒤통수 조심해라
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	because I may just have to
		go get a hero hairdo of my own
		나 혼자서 영웅같은
		헤어스타일로 변신하고
00:05:56	 
		 
00:05:56	and steal your thunder.
		네 특기를 가로챌 수도 있으니
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:10	I got it, mom.
		제가 갈게요, 엄마
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:17	What's wrong?
		무슨 일이야?
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	Tyler knows about
		you and Damon.
		타일러가 너랑 데이먼의
		정체를 알아
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	He knows that Damon
		killed Mason.
		데이먼이 메이슨 죽인 것도
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	I didn't say a word.
		난 아무 말 안했어
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	It's that woman Jules.
		She had a run-in with Damon.
		줄스란 여자야
		데이먼과 대면했어
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:26	Tyler was so upset.
		타일러 엄청 화났더라
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	The look on his face,
		he was so betrayed.
		얼굴 표정이
		심하게 배신당한 모습이었어
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	Wow, this is bad.
		안좋다
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	You're not gonna tell
		Damon, are you? No.
		데이먼한테 말 안 할거지? / 응
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	We hear that he
		wants to kill him.
		그가 타일러를 죽이고 싶다며
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	He thinks all werewolves
		should die,
		늑대인간은 모두
		죽어야 한다 생각해
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	and he's not wrong
		to think that, Caroline.
		그 생각이 잘못된건 아냐, 캐롤라인
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:37	I mean, what if Tyler
		tries to retaliate?
		타일러가 앙갚음하면 어쩌려고?
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	He has every right to.
		He can get himself killed.
		그럴 이유는 충분해
		자살 시도를 할수 있다고
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	Well, we're not gonna
		let that happen.
		그렇게 두면 안되지
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:42	Yeah. We have to get to
		him and reason with him
		그래. 타일러한테 접근해서
		설득하는 거야
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	before he does
		something stupid.
		바보같은 짓 하기 전에
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	You have to talk to him.
		네가 얘기해 봐
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:48	Just try to explain, you know?
		설명을 하는거야
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	You always know the
		right things to say, ok?
		넌 늘 옳은 말을 하잖아
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	He and I...
		We're friends.
		타일러랑 난..
		좋은 친구란 말야
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:57	I was right, wasn't I?
		내 말 맞았지?
00:07:01	 
		 
00:07:01	Your little vampire
		friend, she was lying.
		네 어린 뱀파이어 친구가
		거짓말을 했지
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:06	What do you want?
		원하는 게 뭐에요?
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	I want you to understand
		that a vampire
		이해하거라
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	will never be your friend.
		뱀파이어는 친구가 될 수 없단걸
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	It's our nature to be enemies.
		천성적으로
		우리의 적이야
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	You know how stupid
		that sounds?
		그게 얼마나
		바보같은 소린줄 알아요?
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	You need to leave here,
		it's not safe.
		넌 여길 떠나야 해
		안전하지 않아
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	I can't just run away with you.
		당신과 도망칠 수 없어요
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	I don't even know you.
		My mom would freak.
		난 당신을 몰라요
		엄마는 충격받으실 거구요
00:07:26	 
		 
00:07:27	- My life is here.
		- Your old life.
		- 내 인생이 여기 있어요
		- 네 과거의 삶이겠지
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	Your new life
		is just beginning.
		네 새로운 삶은
		비로소 시작했어
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	You have so much to learn.
		배울게 정말 많단다
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:36	Like what?
		어떤거요?
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	How to survive.
		생존하는 법
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:40	You've triggered
		the curse, Tyler.
		넌 저주를 일으켰어
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:41	It's important you learn what
		it means to be a lycanthrope.
		늑대인간이 되는게 뭔지
		배우는 게 중요해
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	We live by a code of loyalty.
		우리는 충성의 규율을 따르며 살아
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	We take care of each other.
		우리는 서로를 돌보지
00:07:50	 
		 
00:07:50	It's my duty and
		honor to help you.
		널 돕는 것은
		내 의무이자 명예야
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	Please let me.
		제발 돕게 해줘
00:07:55	 
		 
00:07:58	Where's John?
		존은 어디있지?
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	He's not here.
		He left.
		여기 없어요
		떠났어요
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	I don't know where he went.
		어디로 갔는지 모르겠어요
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	He just blew in,
		announced to Jenna
		갑자기 나타나
		제나 이모한테
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	that he's my dad,
		and then took off.
		자기가 아버지라고 말하곤
		사라져버렸죠
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	- It's public knowledge now?
		- Apparently.
		- 이제 다 아는 사실이야?
		- 그런 것 같아요
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	You ok?
		괜찮니?
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	Yeah.
		네
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	Jenna's head is
		spinning, but I'm ok.
		제나 이모는 혼란해 하지만
		난 괜찮아요
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	He say what he was doing here?
		여긴 왜 온건지 말해줬어?
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	No. You know, Stefan thinks
		that he's telling the truth
		아뇨. 사실 스테판은
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:22	about wanting to help me.
		날 돕고 싶단 걸
		믿고 있어요
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:24	You believe him?
		넌 존을 믿니?
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	No. I don't believe him
		for a second.
		아뇨. 1초도 못 믿죠
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	I don't, either.
		나도야
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	- Want are we gonna do?
		- Kill him.
		- 어쩌게?
		- 죽여야지
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	- Damon...
		- I'm joking.
		- 데이먼...
		- 농담이야
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	- Ok. I'm a little serious.
		- Damon!
		- 그래. 약간 진심이지
		- 데이먼!
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	I'm not gonna hurt him, Elena.
		엘레나, 존을 해치지 않을거야
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	I'm the good guy now, remember?
		난 이제 착한 남자가 됐다구
		기억 안나?
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	What does that mean?
		그게 무슨 뜻이죠?
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	I'm gonna have a civil
		conversation with your father.
		네 아버지와
		정중한 대화를 나눌거야
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:49	Wait. I'm coming
		with you.
		잠깐만요. 같이 갈래요
00:08:52	 
		 
00:09:06	I'm not gonna hurt you.
		I just want to talk.
		널 해치지 않을거야
		얘기 좀 하려고
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:10	Then why did you break in?
		그럼 왜 쳐들어 왔어?
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	Would you have let
		me in otherwise?
		안 그랬음
		네가 들여줬을까?
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:17	Shh. Not a word.
		쉿. 조용히 해
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	Tyler, I'm leaving for the memorial.
		타일러, 나 추도회 간다
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:42	Brady?
		브래디?
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:58	This is a hard place to find.
		찾기 힘들었어
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	You told me to stay
		under the radar.
		레이다 망에서 숨어 지내라며
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	Thanks for coming.
		와줘서 고마워
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	You sure these vamps
		killed Mason?
		뱀파이어가 메이슨 죽인거 맞아?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	Positive.
		그래
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	We have to be careful.
		조심해야해
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	I'm not afraid of a vampire.
		뱀파이어가 두렵지 않아
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	I know, baby,
		but I want the boy
		알아, 자기야
		하지만 복수보다는
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	more than I want vengeance.
		그 녀석을 더 원해
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:20	I say, let's get both.
		그럼, 둘 다 해보자고
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:36	Maybe we're getting off
		on the wrong foot here.
		시작이 안 좋았지
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	What happened to Mason?
		메이슨 삼촌은 어떻게 된거야?
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:44	Tyler, there's a lot
		for us to talk about.
		타일러, 우린 할 얘기가 많아
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	I wouldn't do that.
		나라면 안 그럴거야
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:49	Without a full moon,
		you're no match for me.
		보름달이 뜨지 않으면
		넌 대적할 수 없어
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:55	It's good to have you back, John.
		다시 돌아와줘서 고맙네. 존
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	We could really use you.
		당신 도움이 필요해
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	And the council?
		What are they doing?
		의회는요?
		요즘 뭘 하고 있죠?
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	Damon Salvatore
		is leading the council now.
		데이먼 살바토어가
		의회를 이끌고 있어
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:07	Talk to him.
		그와 얘기해보게
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:09	Excuse me.
		실례할게
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:12	Jeremy, there you are.
		제레미, 여기 있었구나
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	Looks like I slept
		through the homecoming.
		귀향하실 동안
		겨울잠을 자고 있었나봐요
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	You didn't miss much.
		온지 얼마 안됐다
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	To say that no one is happy to
		see me would be an understatement.
		내가 와서 기뻐해줄 사람이
		없다는건 너무 줄잡은 표현이지
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	Things are different now.
		이젠 상황이 달라졌어요
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	You can't come around and start
		up with all this antivampire stuff.
		갑자기 돌아와서는
		뱀파이어 반대 여론을 몰 수 없다구요
00:11:26	 
		 
00:11:26	I have no intention
		of doing that.
		난 전혀 그럴 의도가 없다
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	How's that ring
		been treating you?
		반지는 어떠니?
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	Look. If this is
		what you came for,
		이것 때문에 오신 거라면
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	just take it and go.
		그냥 갖고 가세요
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	What kind of man would I be
		if I took that from you?
		그걸 빼앗아가면
		난 어떤 놈이 되겠니?
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:42	- Want to go grab some lunch?
		- Think I'll pass.
		- 점심 좀 먹을래?
		- 사양할게요
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	All right.
		 
00:11:47	 
		 
00:12:00	Hello, Bonnie.
		안녕, 보니
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	I don't have anything to
		say to you, Dr. Martin,
		당신과는 전혀
		얘기하고 싶지 않아요
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	or your son.
		당신 아들도요
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	You must be feeling
		very confused about us.
		우리가 혼란스러웠구나
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	Nothing confusing about it.
		혼란스럽지 않아요
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	I trusted Luka,
		and he betrayed me.
		루카를 믿었는데
		그가 날 배신했죠
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	Elena told me you're
		both working for Elijah,
		엘레나가 그러길 두 분이
		일라이자 밑에서 일한다면서요
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	so don't lie about it.
		그러니 거짓말 말아요
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	I won't, but that doesn't mean
		거짓말 안하겠다
		하지만 그렇다고
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	we're not also
		looking out for you.
		너 대신 경계해주지 않는건 아니다
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	Spare me the witch
		loyalty crap.
		마녀들간의 충의에 대한
		헛소리는 그만하세요
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	You might not want
		to believe this,
		우리를 믿지 않겠지만
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:29	but Elijah is a man
		of his word.
		일라이자는 약속을 지키는 분이셔
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	You can trust that he'll
		keep his end of the deal
		그가 엘레나와 친구들을 지켜주면서
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	with Elena to keep you
		and your friends protected.
		거래를 고수할 거란걸 믿으렴
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	You're right.
		I don't believe it.
		맞아요
		난 하나도 안 믿어요
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:40	Is there a problem here?
		무슨 문제 있어?
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:44	Not at all.
		전혀
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:48	- What was that about?
		- More lies.
		- 방금 뭐였어?
		- 거짓말
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:57	I can't believe it.
		믿을 수가 없다
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Elena is my sister's husband's
		brother's daughter,
		엘레나는 우리 언니 남편의
		남동생의 딸이고
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:03	and her mother is my
		boyfriend's deceased wife.
		그녀 엄마는 내 남자친구의
		사망한 아내라니
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	You can't make this stuff up.
		그런 말은
		지어낼 수도 없다고
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	It's definitely a
		little overwhelming.
		확실히 당황스럽지
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	I can't believe that
		they kept it a secret.
		이걸 비밀로 했다니
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	How it is even possible
		to keep a secret like that?
		어떻게 이런 비밀을
		감추는게 가능해?
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:19	Ach...
		아..
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:23	Hey, you two.
		안녕, 두 분
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	You think I can join you?
		제가 껴도 될까요?
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Do you have to?
		그래야만 하니?
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	I guess I don't have to,
		but might as well.
		그럴 필요는 없지만
		그러고 싶네
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:34	Look who's here.
		누가 왔나
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	We just need answers.
		해답이 필요할 뿐예요
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	Please don't do
		anything stupid.
		제발 바보같은 짓 마요
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:40	Yeah, but stupid
		is so much more fun.
		그래, 하지만
		바보짓이 더 재미있는걸
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	Damon, I mean it.
		데이먼, 진심이에요
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	All I'm asking is you
		try to keep it together.
		제 유일한 부탁은
		정신 차리라는 거에요
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	Be the better man.
		더 나은 모습을
		보여주세요
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:50	Ok, then.
		알았다
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:54	John, buddy...
		How you been?
		존, 친구 어떻게 지냈나?
00:13:59	 
		 
00:13:59	I've been all right, Damon.
		잘 지냈지, 데이먼
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	It's good to see you.
		만나서 기쁘네
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:05	Look, about Caroline,
		no matter what her flaws are,
		캐롤라인 말인데
		결점이 뭐든지 간에
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	when push comes to shove, you're
		gonna want that girl on your side.
		편을 가르고 싶다면
		네 편으로 두는게 좋을거야
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:12	She's your friend.
		Stop being a dick to her.
		캐롤라인은 네 친구야
		못되게 굴지 말라고
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	I thought vampires
		hated werewolves.
		뱀파이어는 늑대인간을
		혐오하는 줄 알았는데
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	That's some sort of leftover
		idea from another time.
		그런 시대 착오적인 생각은
		구시대 발상이야
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	Doesn't have to be
		that way anymore.
		이젠 더이상 그럴 필요 없다구
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:20	We go to the same school.
		We have the same friends.
		우린 같은 학교 다니고
		같은 친구들을 갖고
00:14:22	 
		 
00:14:22	We keep the same secrets.
		This can work, Tyler.
		같은 비밀을 지키는거야
		잘 해나갈 수 있어, 타일러
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:25	I mean, it's your home.
		It's my home, too.
		네 고향이잖아
		내 고향이기도 하고
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	I want this to work.
		잘 풀리길 바래
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:39	Help. Help.
		도와줘
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:42	Whose number was that, hmm?
		누구 번호야?
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:46	Damn it, Tyler.
		젠장, 타일러
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	I'm trying to save your life.
		Can't you see that?
		널 구해주려는 거
		모르겠어?
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:52	We have a problem.
		문제가 생겼어
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:58	So, John, rumor has it,
		존, 소문에 의하면
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	you know a lot and
		won't say anything.
		많은 걸 알면서
		하나도 말 안한다며?
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	How do I know you
		can be trusted, Damon?
		어떻게 자넬 믿을 수 있지?
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Originals can compel
		vampires, according to Stefan.
		1세대 뱀파이어는 스테판이 그러길
		뱀파이어를 조종할 수 있어
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	That's why Katherine
		is still in the tomb,
		캐더린이 무덤에 있는 거지
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	because an original has
		compelled her to stay there.
		1세대 뱀파이어가 무덤에
		주문을 걸었으니까
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:14	Only because all of the
		vervain had left her system.
		그녀 체내에 남은
		마편초 때문이야
00:15:16	 
		 
00:15:16	Stefan and I,
		on the other hand,
		스테판과 나는 반면에
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	are chock full.
		체내가 마편초로 꽉 찼지
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	You guys are drinking vervain?
		마편초를 마시고 있었나?
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	It's an acquired taste.
		습관적으로 맛을 들였지
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	I don't see that magical
		ring on your stitched finger,
		네가 도로 꿰맨 손가락에
		마법의 반지가 안 보이네
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	so if you know something about
		Klaus, you better start talking,
		클라우스에 대해 뭘 안다면
		얘기하는 게 좋을걸
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:31	or I will kill you
		in your sleep.
		아님 잘 때 널 죽일테니
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:36	Now, is that any way
		to convince me
		바로 이게 같은 편이란걸
		보여주는 방법인가?
00:15:39	 
		바로 이게 같은 편이란걸
		보여주는 방법인가?
00:15:39	that you and I are
		on the same side?
		바로 이게 같은 편이란걸
		보여주는 방법인가?
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	First, I need to know that
		I can trust you, Damon,
		우선 난 자넬 신뢰할 수 있는지
		확실히 알아야겠어, 데이먼
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	that I can count on you.
		당신에 의지해도 되는지를
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	Then we'll talk.
		그러고 나서
		얘기를 해보자고
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:57	Hey.
		캐롤라인
00:15:59	 
		 
00:15:59	Hey.
		캐롤라인
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:03	I haven't seen you.
		오랫만이네
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:04	I'm not avoiding you, I swear.
		피하는게 아냐, 맹세해
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:06	Yeah. You're avoiding me a little.
		그래, 약간 피하는 건 맞잖아
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:09	Ok, maybe a little.
		그래, 약간은
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	Can we talk later?
		나중에 얘기할래?
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	I mean, I'm headed to work
		right now, but maybe after,
		지금 일하러 가야되서
		나중에
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	clear up some
		of this weirdness?
		이 이상한 분위기 좀 바꿔볼래?
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:19	Yeah. Yeah. I'd
		really like that.
		그래, 그럼 좋겠다
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:23	I'll just swing by
		when you're closing.
		그릴 문 닫을때 쯤에 들를게
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:25	- Sounds good.
		- Ok. Bye.
		- 좋아
		- 알았어. 잘가
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:37	Excuse me.
		실례해요
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:40	- Caroline, right?
		- Yeah.
		- 캐롤라인 맞죠?
		- 네
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	I'm looking for Tyler.
		타일러 찾고 있어요
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	You haven't seen him, have you?
		못 봤나요?
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:48	No, not since earlier.
		아뇨, 아침 일찍 때 후론 못 봤어요
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	Sorry.
		미안해요
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	I know you're lying.
		거짓말하는 거 알아
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	Really? How?
		정말? 어떻게?
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	Is that one of your
		little wolf tricks?
		늑대인간의 요술 중 하나인가?
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Actually, it is.
		맞아
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:05	Well, I have a trick, too.
		나한테도 재주가 있어
00:17:09	 
		 
00:18:10	I see you got the bullet out.
		총알을 빼낼 수 있군
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	That was nasty.
		좀 징그러웠어요
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:19	I got lots of wooden bullets,
		나한테 나무 총알 많아
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	other toys.
		다른 장난감들도
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:26	It's gonna be a long
		night, sweet pea.
		정말 긴 하룻밤이 될거다, 얘야
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:30	Aah!
		 
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:34	You want
		to be friends, great.
		친구 되고 싶어? 좋아
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	We're friends.
		Will you go now?
		친구하자
		이제 가줄래?
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	I don't know what else
		to say to you, Tyler.
		뭐라고 해야될지 모르겠다, 타일러
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	I came back to this town
		because I wanted a life.
		난 삶을 시작하러
		이 마을에 돌아왔어
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	I wanted to exist
		where I could have friends
		난 내가 친구들을 만들고
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:45	and where I could
		build a family.
		가정을 가꿀 수 있는
		공간에서 살고 싶어
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	I have that here.
		We can both have that.
		이 마을이 그런 곳이야
		우리 둘 다 누릴 수 있다구
00:18:51	 
		 
00:19:01	Hi. Everything ok?
		안녕. 무슨 일 없어?
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	That depends.
		너한테 달려있지
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	How badly do you want
		to keep her alive?
		얼마나 진심으로 그녀를
		살리고 싶으냐에 따라서
00:19:06	 
		 
00:19:08	Who is this?
		누구죠?
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:09	Ask your brother. Where's Tyler?
		네 형한테 물어
		타일러는 어디 있지?
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:15	Jules?
		줄스?
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	Where's Caroline?
		캐롤라인은 어디있어?
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	You made a mistake, Stefan.
		넌 실수를 한거야, 스테판
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	I'm gonna give you
		a chance to fix it.
		만회할 기회를 주는 거야
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Where is she?
		캐롤라인은 어디 있어?
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	Right here.
		Want proof?
		바로 여기
		증거를 원해?
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:28	He needs proof.
		증거를 듣고 싶대
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:36	Aah! Aah!
		 
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	What's happening?
		무슨 일이야?
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	Hurt her again,
		and you're dead.
		더 찌르면
		죽을 줄 알아
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	I hurt her again,
		and she's dead.
		내가 다시 찌르면
		죽게 될거야
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:45	Bring Tyler to me,
		clearing by wickery falls.
		타일러를 데려와
		위커리 폴즈 개간지로
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	You have 20 minutes
		until she dies.
		죽기 전까지
		20분 남았다
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:54	So my friend
		wants to meet you.
		내 친구가
		당신을 만나고 싶어해요
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	Damon Salvatore, this is...
		데이먼 살바토어
		이쪽은..
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	I know you...
		the news lady.
		당신을 알아요
		여성 뉴스 리포터님
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	Yeah, Andie star.
		Nice to meet you.
		네, 앤디 스타에요
		만나서 반가워요
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:10	Can I buy you a drink, Damon?
		제가 술 한잔 사드릴까요?
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:15	My glass is all full, Andie.
		이미 잔이 가득 차서, 앤디
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	Thank you.
		사양할게요
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:23	You totally blew her off.
		완전 퇴짜 놨군요
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	I'm steering clear
		of all women at the moment.
		당장은 여자한테서
		멀리해야 해
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:30	You didn't have to be rude.
		무례하게 나올 필요 없잖아요
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:32	Trust me, it's in the best
		interest of women everywhere.
		믿어봐, 여자들한테 이러는게
		최선의 방책이란걸
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:43	Stefan?
		스테판?
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	What is it?
		뭐야?
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:50	Why am I just finding
		out about this now?
		왜 이걸 지금에서야
		알게 되는 거지?
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:54	Stefan was worried that you...
		스테판이 걱정하기로 당신이..
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	that I would what,
		what I would kill him?
		내가 뭐? 죽일까봐?
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Of course. That's
		what needs to happen.
		물론. 그래야만 하지
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	No, Damon, not Tyler.
		아뇨, 데이먼
		타일러는 안돼요
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	Do whatever you need to do
		to get Caroline back,
		캐롤라인 되찾으려는 방법은
		뭐든지 하세요
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	- but just leave Tyler out of it, ok?
		_ Why?
		- 하지만 타일러는 냅둬요
		- 왜?
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:04	He's a werewolf. He needs to die.
		늑대인간이야
		죽어야 한다구
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	I'm willing to kill.
		It's a win-win.
		난 기꺼이 죽일거야
		누이좋고 매부 좋은거라구
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	Damon, please, ok?
		Too many people are dead.
		데이먼, 제발요
		많은 사람들이 죽었어요
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	You need to stop doing that.
		너 그만 좀 해라
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	Doing what?
		뭘 그만해요?
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	Assuming that I'll
		play the good guy
		네가 부탁했다고 해서
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	because it's you who's asking.
		착한 연기를 해줄거란거
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	Be the better man, Damon.
		더 나은 모습을
		보여주세요, 데이먼
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:28	Do you mind?
		 
00:21:28	Do you mind?
		실례지만
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	- What's going on?
		- Nothing.
		- 무슨 일이야?
		- 아무것도 아녜요
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	Doesn't look like nothing.
		뭔 일이 있어 보이는데
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:33	Well, guess what, John.
		이거 알아, 존
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:34	Trust works both ways.
		Get out.
		믿음이란 양쪽에서
		하는 거야. 나가줘
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	Look. We don't
		have time for this.
		이럴 시간 없다구요
00:21:37	 
		 
00:21:37	We need to get Caroline back.
		캐롤라인 되찾아야 해요
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	We don't need to do anything.
		I'll take care of it.
		우린 아무것도 안해도 되
		내가 처리할거야
00:21:41	 
		 
00:21:41	First dad duty... ground
		your daughter. Keep her here.
		첫 아빠로서의 역할로
		외출 금지시켜. 여기다 묶어둬
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:43	- I'm coming with you.
		- No, no, no, no.
		- 같이 갈래요
		- 안 돼
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	I'm with Damon on this one.
		이번은 데이먼 편을 들래
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:46	Uh-uh. Nope. Stop, stop.
		You're not going anywhere.
		안 돼, 멈춰
		넌 아무대도 못가
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	Just tell me what's going on.
		무슨 일인지 말해주렴
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:55	So...
		그럼...
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:58	How many vampires are
		there in this town anyway?
		이 동네에 뱀파이어가
		몇 마리나 있는거지?
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:13	- No?
		- Why are you doing this to me?
		싫어? / 왜 이러는 거죠?
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:17	Why are you doing
		this to me? Why?
		왜 나한테 이러는 거냐구요? 왜?
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	You're a vampire.
		넌 뱀파이어니까
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:25	Why not?
		안될게 뭐있어?
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:31	I'm sorry.
		What was that?
		미안. 방금 뭐라고?
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:34	Get me out!
		나가게 해줘요?
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	Excuse me?
		What was that?
		잠깐? 뭐라고?
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:39	Let me out!
		나가게 해달라구요
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:49	Get it out of your system?
		처리했어?
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	No. I'm just
		getting started.
		아니, 아직 시작도 안했어
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:53	Brady, let's be
		smart about this.
		브래디, 지혜롭게 행동해
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	I just want the boy.
		난 그 녀석을 원할 뿐야
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	It's our duty to help
		him. It's who we are.
		그를 돕는건 우리 임무야
		우리 천성이라고
00:22:58	 
		 
00:22:58	You want to talk
		duty and honor?
		의무와 명예에 대해 말하고 싶어?
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:00	These are vampires.
		이 놈들은 뱀파이어야
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	They cross one of us,
		they cross all of us.
		우리 중 하나를 죽이면
		모두를 거스르는 거라고
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:06	That's who we are.
		그게 우리의 본모습이지
00:23:07	 
		 
00:23:11	You're not leaving
		this restaurant.
		여길 떠나면 안된다
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	You can't tell me what to do.
		나한테 이래라 저래라 하지 마요
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:14	Yes, I can.
		Want to know why?
		그래도 돼
		왜 그런지 알고 싶니?
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	Because I'm here to
		make sure you stay safe.
		난 네가 안전함을
		확인하러 왔으니까
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	I've got that covered.
		그건 따로 맡은 분이 있어요
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	Are you talking about the deal
		너 지금 일라이자와 한
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	that you made with Elijah?
		거래를 말하는 거냐?
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:23	You really think he's gonna
		keep his promise to you?
		너 정말 그가
		약속을 지킬 것 같아?
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:26	Putting your faith in
		him was a dumb move.
		그를 믿는 건
		바보같은 짓이었다
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	Are you saying I should
		put my faith in you?
		그럼 당신을 믿으란 건가요?
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:31	After everything that you
		did to Stefan and Damon?
		스테판과 데이먼한테 했던
		모든 일을 뒤로 하고요?
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:33	We've had our differences,
		차이점이 있었고
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	and I've made mistakes,
		내가 실수를 했지만
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:36	but you and I, we're family.
		너랑 나는
		가족이란다
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:38	You don't get to use that word.
		그 단어는 꺼낼 자격도 없어요
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:40	That word is off limits to you.
		당신한텐 금지 단어라구요
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	Fine, but it doesn't
		change the facts.
		좋아, 그렇다고
		사실이 바뀌진 않지
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:49	You're right. Facts
		are facts, so listen up.
		맞아요. 사실은 사실이니
		들어봐요
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	You may be my father, but I am
		never going to be your daughter.
		당신이 아버지일지 모르지만
		난 절대 당신 딸이 되지 않을거에요
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	You got that?
		아셨어요?
00:23:56	 
		 
00:24:13	I know you're out there.
		밖에 있는 거 알아
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:23	Where's Caroline?
		캐롤라인은 어디 있지?
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:25	Locked up tight.
		단단히 갖혀 있지
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	Let her go and I'll
		release Tyler.
		캐롤라인을 풀어주면
		타일러를 놔줄게
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:31	It doesn't have
		to get any messier
		상황을 더 지저분하게
		만들 필요 없잖아
00:24:32	 
		상황을 더 지저분하게
		만들 필요 없잖아
00:24:32	than it already has.
		상황을 더 지저분하게
		만들 필요 없잖아
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	I'm not your enemy, Jules.
		난 당신 적이 아냐, 줄스
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:35	It's a little late to be waving
		a white flag, don't you think?
		백기를 들긴
		너무 늦은 것 같지 않아?
00:24:38	 
		 
00:24:40	You need to leave town.
		동네를 떠나줘
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:42	No one else has to get hurt.
		아무도 다치지 않게
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:45	I'm not leaving without Tyler.
		난 타일러 없이 안 가
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:48	Tyler's free to make
		his own decisions.
		결정은 타일러 몫이야
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:51	As soon as you
		release Caroline.
		캐롤라인을 풀어주기만 하면
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:54	My brother the peacemaker.
		조정자 역할의
		내 동생이라
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:58	Since Stefan
		got here before me,
		스테판이 나보다 일찍 왔으니
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	I'm gonna let him
		try it his way
		그의 방법을 먼저 시도하게 하고
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	before I resort to my way,
		내 방식을 보여주지
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	which is a little bloodier.
		약간 잔인하긴 하지만
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	So give us Caroline.
		그러니까
		캐롤라인 내놔
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:07	Let go of Tyler.
		타일러 놔줘
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	Give us Caroline.
		Light of full moon.
		캐롤라인을 풀어주면
		보름달이 아니면
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:10	It's not an even fight
		and you know it.
		싸움이 못될거 알잖아
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:13	We'll take you.
		당신을 쓰러뜨릴 수 있다고
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:16	I'm not so sure
		about that, tough guy.
		그건 잘 모르겠네
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:37	Let's try this again.
		다시 해보자
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	Give us Tyler.
		타일러 내놔
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:43	You heard her. Go.
		들었지. 가
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:52	Which one of you killed Mason?
		메이슨 죽인게 누구야?
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:53	Uh, that'd be me.
		그건 나 같네
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:56	Boys, make sure
		that one suffers.
		얘들아, 고통스럽게 죽여라
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:03	We can take them.
		우리가 쓰러뜨리자
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	I don't know about that.
		잘 모르겠다
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:06	Well, then...
		그럼..
00:26:08	 
		 
00:26:27	Tyler!
		There's a latch.
		타일러?
		걸쇠가 있어
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	There's a latch on the door
		and I can't get to it.
		문에 걸쇠가 있는데
		안 닿아
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:32	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:39	Tyler, please.
		Tyler?
		타일러, 제발
00:26:42	 
		 
00:27:54	What's happening?
		무슨 일이야?
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:57	What the hell's going on?
		대체 무슨 일이 생긴거지?
00:27:59	 
		 
00:28:16	Elijah made a promise to Elena.
		일라이자님이
		엘레나와 거래를 했네
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:19	I'm here to see it's upheld.
		그 거래가 잘 지켜지나 보러 왔네
00:28:21	 
		 
00:28:22	You need to go.
		이 곳을 당장 떠나게
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:34	Get out of here. Now.
		어서 여길 떠나, 당장
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:45	When your friends awaken,
		give them a message.
		친구들이 깨어나면
		메세지 전달하게
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	They need to get the hell
		out of this town.
		당장 이 마을을 떠나라고
00:28:52	 
		 
00:29:12	So is your mom home?
		어머니 집에 계셔?
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	No.
		아니. 경찰서에 계서
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	I can come in
		if you want me to.
		네가 원하면
		같이 들어가줄게
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	I'm fine, Stefan.
		괜찮아, 스테판
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:22	You don't have to
		pretend with me.
		나한테는 괜찮은 척 할 필요 없어
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	Anybody would be upset after
		누구든 열받아 있을거야
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	what you went through tonight.
		오늘 네가 겪은 일을 겪게 된다면
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:33	I'm ok.
		난 괜찮아
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:37	I'm not girlie, little
		Caroline anymore.
		난 여리고 약한 캐롤라인이 아냐
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:41	I can handle myself.
		감당할 수 있어
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:45	You sure can.
		물론 그렇지
00:29:47	 
		 
00:29:51	I just really want to
		go shower, so...
		가서 샤워해야겠어
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	Ok.
		알았어
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	Good night.
		Good night.
		잘 자
00:29:58	 
		 
00:30:08	What do you want?
		원하는 게 뭐야?
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	We didn't finish
		our conversation.
		대화 아직 안 끝냈잖나
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:13	I'll bite.
		좋아
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:15	I've been thinking. Personal
		feelings aside, Damon,
		생각해봤는데
		개인적 감정은 제쳐두고
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	I think you and Stefan
		자네와 스테판은
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	will do all you can
		to protect Elena.
		엘레나를 지키려
		무엇이든 할걸 아네
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	I agree with that statement.
		그 의견엔 동의해
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	So I come bearing gifts.
		그래서 선물 가져왔네
00:30:28	 
		 
00:30:30	What the hell is that?
		대체 그게 뭐야?
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:32	This is how you kill
		an original.
		1세대 뱀파이어를
		죽이는 특효약
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:36	In this vial is ash
		from a white oak tree
		이 병에 있는 건
		1세대 뱀파이어가 기원한 시기의
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:38	that dates back to the
		genesis of the originals.
		하얀 오크나무에서 추출한 재라네
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:41	The dagger must be
		dipped into the ash
		단도에 재를 깊게 묻혀서
00:30:44	 
		 
00:30:44	and then plunged
		into their heart.
		심장을 찔러야 하네
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:50	How do you know all this, John?
		이런걸 다 어떻게 알지?
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:52	Isobel. She's very good
		at finding out things.
		이자벨이 알려줬어
		정보 알아내는데 도사지
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:57	But of course you know that.
		그건 자네도 잘 알거야
00:30:58	 
		 
00:30:58	Where is Isobel?
		이자벨은 어디 있어?
00:30:59	 
		 
00:31:00	Let's just say if she
		accomplishes what she's attempting,
		그녀가 시도하는 일에
		성공을 한다면
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	Klaus will never set
		foot in Mystic Falls.
		클라우스는 미스틱 폴즈에
		절대 발들일 수 없다고만 해두지
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:08	Where Elena's concerned,
		엘레나와 관계된 일에는
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	you and I are on the same side.
		나도 자네와 같은 편이라네
00:31:11	 
		 
00:31:29	Hi.
		안녕
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:30	Hey. Did something
		happen?
		무슨 일 있었어?
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:34	Oh, my... I am
		so sorry, Matt.
		이럴수가.. 미안해, 맷
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	Are you ok?
		Yeah.
		괜찮아
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	Something came up with Bonnie
		보니한테 일이 생겨서
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:42	and she needed me.
		내가 가줘야 했어
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	A friend thing.
		You understand?
		친구만의 일이라
		이해해?
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:47	Yeah. So you with her
		right now?
		응. 그럼 보니랑 같이 있어?
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	Yeah. So I'm not
		gonna make it tonight,
		응, 그래서 갈 수가 없었어
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:53	but can I see you tomorrow?
		그치만 내일 만날수 있을까?
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:55	Yeah. Sure. I hope
		everything works out.
		물론. 다 잘 풀리길 바라
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:58	Good night.
		좋은 밤 돼
00:31:59	 
		 
00:31:59	Good night.
		좋은 밤 돼
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:17	Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:20	I'm fine.
		그래
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	I had no idea they
		would come for you.
		널 쫓아올 줄 몰랐어
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:27	Do you know what
		they did to me?
		그 놈들이 나한테
		무슨 짓을 했는줄 알아?
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:30	I'm sorry.
		But it's crazy now.
		미안해
		난 미치겠어
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	Ok? I don't know
		who to trust.
		누굴 믿어야 할지 모르겠어
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	You lied to me.
		넌 나한테 거짓말을 했다고
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	I lied to protect my friends.
		내 친구들을 지키려
		거짓말 한거야
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:42	I lied to protect you.
		Don't you get that?
		널 지키려 거짓말 했고
		그거 모르겠니?
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:45	Caroline... you
		just stood there
		- 캐롤라인..
		- 넌 거기 서있기만 했어
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	when they were
		going to kill us.
		그들이 우리를 죽이려 할 때
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:48	You just stood there.
		You didn't do anything.
		그냥 서있기만 했다구
		아무 것도 안했어
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:51	I didn't know what to do.
		난 뭘 해야될지 몰랐어
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:52	You help your friend.
		That's what you do.
		친구는 친구를 돕는거야
		그래야 하지
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:56	I'm sorry.
		No, it's too late.
		- 미안해
		- 사과하긴 늦었어
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	Because we're not
		friends anymore.
		우린 더이상 친구가 아니니까
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	And what happened
		to me tonight,
		오늘밤 있었던 일은
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	that will never happen again.
		다시는 없을거야
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	So you take that back to
		your little werewolf pack
		그러니까 네 늑대인간
		패거리들한테 돌아가
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	and you get the hell
		out of my house.
		당장 우리 집에서 나가라고
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:28	I'm sorry about earlier.
		요전에 미안했다
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	Enough already.
		I don't want you here
		그 정도면 됐어요
		여기 오시는거 원치 않아요
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:32	and I can't make that
		any more clear.
		확실히 말씀드린 것 같은데요
00:33:34	 
		 
00:33:34	I didn't come here to
		fight with you, Elena.
		난 너와 다투려고 온게 아니다
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	Yeah, I know.
		You're here to protect me.
		알아요
		지켜주시러 오셨죠
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	Got it.
		Get in line.
		알았어요
		줄 서세요
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:41	I thought you might want this.
		네가 원할 것 같았다
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:45	It was your mother's.
		네 엄마꺼다
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:49	Isobel?
		No.
		- 이자벨요?
		- 아니
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:51	Your mother. Miranda.
		너희 엄마. 머랜다
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:55	I remember her wearing
		it when she was young.
		어릴때 끼고 있던게 기억나
00:33:58	 
		 
00:34:00	I found it in a box with some
		things that your dad left me.
		네 아버지가 남겨준 유품에서 찾았다
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:05	Here. It's yours now.
		여기. 이제 네꺼다
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:11	Miranda and Grayson were
		your parents, Elena.
		머랜다와 그레이슨은
		네 부모님이었어, 엘레나
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:17	I know I'm nothing to you.
		난 아무 의미 없는거 안다
00:34:20	 
		 
00:34:22	You have no reason to
		believe me or trust me.
		넌 날 믿거나 신뢰할
		이유가 하나도 없어
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	I've done so many
		horrible things.
		난 정말 끔찍한 짓들을 해왔다
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	But when you lost
		your parents...
		하지만 네가 부모님을 잃었을때
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:31	I lost my brother, my family.
		난 내 형제와
		가족을 잃었다
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:36	I lost my way.
		길을 잃었지
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	I know I'm probably never going
		to make things right with you.
		난 어쩌면 평생을
		너와 바로잡을 수 없을거다
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	I know that, but...
		그걸 알지만..
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:44	I'm gonna do everything
		I can to protect you
		난 너와 네 가족을 지키려
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	and protect this family.
		뭐든지 할거야
00:34:49	 
		 
00:35:04	Elena?
		엘레나
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:14	Are you ok?
		괜찮니?
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	I'm fine.
		괜찮아
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	Did you hear that?
		방금 들었어?
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	I don't believe him, Stefan.
		못 믿겠어, 스테판
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:22	I just don't.
		정말로
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:28	What happened tonight?
		How's Caroline?
		아까는 어떻게 됐어?
		캐롤라인은?
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:31	I could use your help.
		네 도움이 필요해
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:38	Hey. Come on in.
		들어와
00:35:39	 
		 
00:35:47	I'm sorry about your friends.
		아까 당신 친구들 일은 안됐어요
00:35:49	 
		 
00:36:13	It's not always
		like this. Is it?
		늘 이렇진 않죠?
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	No. Is it, Brady?
		그래, 늘 이렇진 않지?
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:21	No, man.
		그래
00:36:23	 
		 
00:36:23	You're living in vampire
		country, that's all.
		뱀파이어 소굴에
		살아서 그러는거야
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:26	It's way better than this.
		이것보단 나았었지
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:29	Mason didn't tell me
		anything about it.
		메이슨은 아무 말도 안해줬어요
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	He was gone.
		Dead, I guess,
		사라졌어요
		죽은거겠죠
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	before he could help me.
		날 돕기도 전에 말이죠
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:36	I don't get what Mason
		was even doing here
		난 도대체 메이슨이
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:37	in the first place.
		뭐하러 왔던건지 모르겠어
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:38	His brother died.
		You know that, Brady.
		형이 돌아가셨잖아
		그거 알지, 브래디
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	Why was he
		stupid enough to stay
		왜 바보같이 돌아와서
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	and get himself killed?
		죽을 짓을 한걸까?
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	Because of this rock
		he was trying to find.
		그가 찾으려던 돌 때문이죠
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:48	What rock?
		무슨 돌?
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	A moonstone.
		월장석요
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:52	I had no idea.
		전혀 몰랐어
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:53	What?
		뭘?
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:57	Moonstone?
		Did he find it?
		월장석이라고?
		메이슨이 찾았니?
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	- Yeah.
		- Where is it now?
		- 네
		- 어딨어?
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:04	I couldn't tell you.
		말 못해요
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:25	- Hey.
		- Hey.
		- 안녕
		- 안녕
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:27	What's going on? I was

00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	She's with another man,
		I assume?
		다른 남자 곁에 있군요?

		난 누구 주변에 있든
		나 자신을 믿을 수 없어요, 앤디
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:26	I'm bad, Andie.
		I do things.
		난 못된 놈이죠
		못된 짓을 해요
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:31	I kill people.
		사람을 죽이죠
00:39:32

00:39:57	It's in my nature.
		It's who I am.
		내 천성이에요
		내 본모습이죠
00:39:59	 
		 
00:40:01	But then I have to stay
		together to protect her
		하지만 난 정신을 차리고
		그녀를 지켜야 해요
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:03	and she wants me
		to be the better man,
		그녀는 더 나은 남자가 되길 원하고요
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:04	which means I can't
		be who I am.

		할 수 없단거죠
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:10	Do you see the problem
		I'm having, Andie?
		내 문제가 뭔지 알겠나요, 앤디?
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:13	Well, maybe this is
		who you are now.
		지금의 모습이
		당신의 참모습일지 몰라요
00:40:15	 
		 
00:40:16	Love does that, Damon.
		It changes us.
		사랑은 그렇거든요
		사람을 바꾸죠
