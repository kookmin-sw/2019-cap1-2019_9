00:15:08	- I love naps!
		- Who doesn't?
		- 나 낮잠 좋아!
		
		- 아닌 사람도 있어?
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	This is ridiculous!
		이건 말도 안돼!
00:15:11	 
		 
00:15:11	The irony that, despite you

		아이러니하게도
		
		두 분은 일생의 적이지만
00:15:14	 
		 
00:15:14	it appears you agree on everything?

00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	No!
		아니!
00:15:16

00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	If I don't drive you to get your keys,
		제가 태워드려야 열쇠를 가져오시죠
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	how are you gonna get your car?

00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	Anyway, I was wondering if

		아이라, 전 유부녀예요
		
		그런 일은 없을 겁니다
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:46	Wow. I didn't pick up that
		energy when I was planking you.
		그런 줄 몰랐네요
		
		플랭크 자세할 땐..

		차키를 잃어버렸어
		
		누구랑 통화했어?
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	- Nobody. Why are your pants ripped?
		- No reason.
		- 아무도. 바지는 왜 찢어졌어?
		
		- 이유없이
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	Here they are. See you later!

00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	Phil, why didn't you show me @@/this@@\ house?
		필, 왜 이 집을 안 보여준거예요?
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	It has everything I want.
		제가 원하던 걸 다 갖췄는데
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	I forgot it was for sale.
		매물로 나온 줄 몰랐네요
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	You're the agent.
		중개인이 당신이잖아요
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	Oh. I remember... It's built cheap.
		아 제 기억에.. 좀 싸게 지었어요
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	It... looks pretty solid to me.
		튼튼해 보이는 데요
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	Well, it's mostly held up by beehives.
		벌집에 다 덮혔어요
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	- Let's go.
		- Phil, what is going on?
		- 가죠
		
		- 필, 대체 뭐예요?
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Nothing. Just trying to keep you

		아니에요 그냥
		
		석면에서 좀 멀어지시라고
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	Do you not want me as a neighbor?
		내가 이웃에 오는 게 싫어요?
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:25	Okay.
		그래요
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	I-I can't do this anymore. No more lies.
		더이상 못하겠어요
		
		거짓말은 그만할게요
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	It is related to that.
		그거랑 관련이 있어요
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	Wow. [Chuckles]
		와우
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	I did not peg you for a racist.

		잘있어요, 필
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	No, Angie! That's not it!
		아뇨, 앤지! 그게 아니에요!
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	I lied to my wife because she knows
		I have a thing for black women!
		아내한테 거짓말을 했어요
		
		내가 흑인 여성을 좋아하는 걸 알거든요!
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	Oh, really?
		아 그래?
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	Hey, there!

00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	So, that was Angie O'Hara?
		그래 저 사람이 앤지 오하라야?
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	Okay.
		그래
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	Full disclosure...

00:17:52	 
		다 밝힐게
00:17:53	Mm-hmm.
		 
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:54	- ...I did lie.
		- Mm-hmm.
		거짓말했어
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	But only because she's beautiful
		and you get a little crazy.
		하지만 앤지가 아름답고
		
		당신이 조금 미친듯 굴어서 그래
00:17:59	 
		 
00:18:00	Why the hell did I say@@/ that?!@@\
		대체 왜 그런 말을 했을까요?!

00:18:07	Oh, it's okay. [Scoffs]
		아 괜찮아
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	You're being so understanding.
		It's so unlike you.
		너무 이해심이 많잖아
		
		당신같지 않아
00:18:11	 
		 
00:18:11	Are you secretly mad?
		조용하게 화난 거야?
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	Are you lulling me into a
		false sense of security?
		일부러 안심시키고 있는 거야?
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	Are you gonna do something
		to me while I'm asleep?
		내가 자는 동안에 뭔가 할 거야?
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:17	Phil, you know what really gets my goat?

00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	[Sighs] That you lied.
		당신이 거짓말한거야

00:18:21	Guess men are men.
		남자는 다 똑같은 가봐
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:23	I don't know why I
		expected anything more.
		왜 다를 거라 생각했는지
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	[Ringing]
		 
00:18:24

00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	It did bother me that Ra

		그는 매력적인 남자고
		
		당신은 섹시한 여자잖아요
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	Of course he put his hands all over you.

00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Yeah, Sydney. I'm just showing

		넌 왜 꾸물거리고 있는 거야?
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	Because I don't want her to get hurt!

00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:30	No, see, it's not the
		worst thing in the world
		아니 진짜로 나쁜 일이 아니잖아
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:31	that she's actually
		starting to be cautious.
		릴리가 조심하기 시작한 게 말야
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	She used to fly off of bookcases
		and jump off of swing sets,
		옛날엔 책장에서 날아떨어지고
		
		그네에서 뛰어내렸었다구
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	and now she's trying to protect herself.
		이제야 스스로를 보호하려고 하잖아
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	And what kind of life is she gonna have
		그럼 앞으로 삶이 어떻게 되겠어
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	if she's scared of everything?
		모든걸 무서워하면?
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	A life where I don't
		have to worry about her.
		내가 걱정할 필요 없는 삶
00:19:42

00:19:51	I guess we can wait a couple
		weeks if she wants to.
		릴리가 원하면 몇 주 정도는 기다려도 돼

		악! 마이갓! 내ㅐ갊먀ㅎ
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:18	Angie, thank you so much for meeting me.
		앤지, 만나줘서 정말 고마워요
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	- This is my wife, Claire.
		- Hi.
		- 제 아내 클레어입니다
		
		- 안녕하세요
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	You need to know that my husband is
		the furthest thing from a racist.
		제 남편은 인종 차별주의자랑은
		
		정말 거리가 멀어요
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	- I love black women.
		- Maybe a little too much.
		- 전 흑인 여성을 좋아해요
		
		- 지나칠 정도로요
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	So, I told her that you were
		white, which is the only reason
		그래서 당신이 백인이라고 했고
		
		그게 건너편에 안 왔으면 했던
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	I didn't want you living
		across the street.
		유일한 이유였습니다
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	I didn't want her to find
		out that I was lying.
		제가 거짓말한 걸 들키지 않으려구요
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	- Is that true?
		- Sadly, yes.
		- 정말이에요?
		
		- 슬프게도, 네
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:38	Well, I@@/ am@@\ relieved.
		안심이네요
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:39	Although it is a little offensive
		to be reduced to a type.
		인종이 취향화되는 건 조금 불쾌하지만요
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:42	Of course. I'm sorry.
		물론이죠
		
		죄송합니다
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	- Hey, babe. Everything okay?
		- Yeah, everything is fine.
		- 자기 괜찮아?
		
		- 응 괜찮아
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	Just a big misunderstanding.
		This is Phil.
		다 오해였어
		
		필씨야
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	- Hi.
		- Hi.
		- 안녕하세요
		
		- 안녕하세요
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	And his wife, Claire.
		부인이신 클레어씨
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	- Hi.
		- Well...
		안녕하세요
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	Hello.
		안녕하세요
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:57	Yeah, apology accepted.
		네 사과는 받아드릴게요
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	I'm on fire.
		나 완전 불붙었네
00:20:59	 
		나 완전 불붙었네
