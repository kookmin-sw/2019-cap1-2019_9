		가장 가까이 다가오는 밤이야 
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	It's beautiful, isn't it?
		아름답지? 
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	Yes, it is, but the victim is over here.
		그렇긴 한데, 희생자가 저기 있다
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	I know.
		알아

		피해자 이름은 Eleanor Artega, 흉부에 총상입니다
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	There were reports of
		gunshots around 11:00.
		총격은 11시 전후였던 것 같습니다
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	Is she from the neighborhood?
		여기 사람이야?
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	ID gives an address
		across town, but one
		신분증상 주소는 시가지 쪽이지만 
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	of the Sac PD officers said
		she grew up in the neighborhood.
		지역 경찰이 여기 출신이라더군요
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	Her mother runs a grocery
		a few blocks away.
		그 어머니가 여기서 몇블럭 밖에서 수퍼마켓을 한답니다 
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	Pretty dress. Maybe she was coming
		from some kind of event. Wedding?
		옷이 예쁜데 무슨 행사에서 오는 길인가, 결혼식?
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	Performance, more like it.
		She's a musician.
		공연 같은 거겠지 뭔가의 연주자니까 
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	- Some kind of stringed instrument.
		- Because?
		- 현악기 같은것
		- 이유는?
00:00:49	 
		 
00:00:49	Because of the calluses
		on her fingertips
		손가락 끝에 굳은 못이 박혀있고 
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:51	and the faint piney scent
		of rosin on her dress.
		옷에서 엷게 송진 냄새가 나 
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	Been a couple of gang
		initiation killings in the area.
		몇달간 갱단 입문을 위한 무차별 살인이 몇건 있었답니다
00:00:57	 
		 
00:00:57	Could be another one.
		I'll talk to the Sac PD Gang Unit,
		그중 하나일 수 있습니다 
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	- see who's active.
		- We'll canvass the looky loos.
		- 여기 경찰에 활동중인 조직이 어디냐고 물어보죠

00:01:02	Hydrangea petal.
		수국 꽃잎이라
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:05	Interesting decoration
		for a gang slaying,
		갱단의 소행치곤 흥미로운걸 
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	unless the crips have
		taken up flower arranging,
		갱이 꽃다발을 집어갔을 것 같진 않지만 
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:10	which I can definitely see
		the therapeutic benefits of.
		수국은 기분을 편안하게 해준단 말이야
00:01:13	 
		 
00:01:14	Thank you.
		고마워
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	Evidence, I believe.

		I'm walking here, right?
		빌어먹을, 눈은 뜨고 다니는거야?
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	You walked into me.
		네가 와서 부딪쳤다 
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	Hell I did.
		그래, 그랬다 
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	You need to get behind
		the line. Police only here.
		통제선 밖으로 나가 일반인은 출입 금지다
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:37	Trying to find out who killed that lady?

		- Keep walkin'.
		- 내가 고자질이나 할 사람으로 보여?
		- 가던 길이나 가 
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:45	Go on.
		어서

		아무거라도 생각나시는게 있으면 부디 
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:51	Just give us a call and, uh,
		thank you very much for your time.
		전화주시구요, 시간 내주셔서 고맙구요 
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:55	I know it's slow,
		but it's how the work is done.
		지루해 보이겠지만 다들 이렇게 일하는거야 
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	Yeah, I could point out someone
		that knows something useful
		뭔가 알만한 사람이라면 
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	- with 25 words or less.
		- Oh, really?
		- 나같음 열마디도 할 필요 없어 
		- 그러셔?
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	Count 'em.
		세고 있어봐 
00:02:04

00:02:13	Oops. It's not $100.

00:02:30	The point being...

		plaid shirt with the beanie
		격자무늬 셔츠에 비니 쓴 남자 
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:34	didn't even consider raising his hand.
		처음부터 손도 들지 않았어 
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	That means he has information that
		즉슨 백달러를 주고도 살 수 없는 
00:02:37	 
		 
00:02:37	- not even $100 can buy.
		- Sir? Uh, you in the plaid,

00:06:27	You hope? Why?
		바란다니 왜?
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	Well, because if it is,

00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	tragic, but dull,
		비극적이지만 진부하지 
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	which is to be avoided at all costs.

		아동복지국이 와서 데려가겠죠 
00:07:28	 
		 
00:07:28	Yeah. No, I have a
		court appearance today.
		오늘은 법정에 출두할 일이 있어서 
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	I gotta unload him.
		He's all yours.
		여기 데려온 겁니다 요원이 맡아주셔야 합니다 
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	- I okayed it with your boss already.
		- You're joking.
		- 그쪽 책임자 분한테는 말해뒀습니다
		- 농담이죠
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	No joke. Thanks for your help,
		Officer Beller.
		농담 아니다 감사합니다, 벨러 경관님 
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	- We appreciate the assist.
		- No problem.
		- 여기까지 와주시고 수고하셨어요
		- 천만에요
00:07:41	 
		 
00:07:42	- Boss...
		- Sac PD are not babysitters.
		- 반장님
		- 지역 경찰이 탁아소야?
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	He stole your keys.
		He's your problem.
		녀석은 네 차키를 슬쩍했으니 네가 책임져야지
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	Make sure he doesn't take anything else.
		다른건 손대지 못하게 잘 봐 
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:50	Sir, you gotta believe me
		when I say how sorry I am.
		정말 죄송하게 됐네요 
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	Don't talk.
		입 다물어
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:54	- No, really, I'm sorry.
		- Not buying it.
		- 아니, 정말 죄송하다니까요
		- 택도 없는 소리 마 
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	Come on.
		이리 와 
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:58	Whatever, punk.
		경찰 똘마니 주제에 
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	That's more like it.
		훨씬 애 답군 
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:10	Mr. Jane?
		제인씨? 
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	Hi. I'm Kieran Carruthers,
		Kieran Carruthers입니다, 안녕하세요 
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	the company's outreach assistant.
		심포니 홍보 담당입니다 
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	Front office said I might find you here.
		고객부서에서 들으니 여기 와 계시다고 
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	You're no bureaucrat.
		You're a musician.
		직원 아니라 연주자 맞으시죠?
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:18	Yes, I'm the principal oboist.
		네 수석 오보에 주자입니다
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	Definitely oboe-esque.
		오보에 스럽게 생기셨네요 
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:24	Concertmaster sits, uh, here, yes?
		콘서트마스터 자리가 저기쯤 되나요?
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	Yes.
		맞습니다 
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:31	Interesting bookmark.
		신기한 책갈피네요
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	- Yeah, looks like an expensive one.
		- Really?
		- 비싸보이네요
		- 그래요?
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	Yeah.
		네 
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:40	You know, if you tell me
		what you're looking for,
		저기, 뭘 찾으시는지 말씀해 주시면
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	- I might be able to help.
		- I'm looking for a killer.
		- 제가 도와드릴 수 있을것 같은데 
		- 살인자를 찾고 있습니다 
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:46	But... I'm sorry.
		Eleanor's killer? Here?
		죄송한데, 엘레노어 사건이요? 여기서요?
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	You're musicians,
		professional obsessors.
		음악가시잖아요 음악가란 강박장애의 선두주자들이죠 
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	Most kids spend their
		teen years having fun.
		애들은 대부분 놀면서 자라지만 
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	You spent them practicing scales.
		It's a noble pursuit,
		당신네는 악보를 파먹으며 살았죠 실로 숭고한 열정입니다만
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	but as a result,
		you're all a little nutty.
		그 결과로 좀 모지라 보이시네요 
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	Well, uh, okay,
		I don't know if I'd say that.
		아 뭐 좋습니다만, 동의해야 할지 모르겠네요 
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	There's a definite air
		of unrest in the room.
		이 방 안에 긴장된 공기가 뚜렷한데 
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:02	- What is that about?
		- Right.
		- 뭣 때문입니까?
		- 그거요 
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	We're supposed to start our
		season a day after tomorrow.
		모레가 연주 시즌 시작이에요 
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	Opening night, big fund-raising
		meet and greet with our donors.
		대형 기금 모금 행사를 열고 후원자들을 접대하게 되죠 
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	Some of us thought we should
		postpone because of Eleanor,
		엘레노어 때문에라도 연기해야 되는거 아니냐고 하지만 
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	but the, uh, maestro didn't agree.
		마에스트로께서 안된다고 하시네요
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:14	Your conductor...
		A tyrant?
		지휘자가 독재자 스타일입니까? 
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:17	Vincent Manheiser.
		Vincent Manheiser라고...
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	I wouldn't say he's a tyrant.
		독재자라고 하긴 뭣하지만 
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	He's just... not nice.
		같이 지내기 유쾌한 사람은 아니죠
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	All right, let's get to work.
		일들 합시다 
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	See for yourself.
		그럼 계시다 가세요 
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	Come on, people. Let's go.
		다들 시작들 합시다
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:27	Haven't got all day.
		Up, up, up. Come on.
		시간이 늘 많은게 아니에요 긴장, 긴장 
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:31	All right.
		좋아
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:35	- Constance.
		- Yes, maestro?
		- 콘스탄스 
		- 네, 마에스트로?
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	You will take Eleanor's
		seat as concertmaster.
		엘레노어의 콘서트마스터직은 자네가 잇는다
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:41	You've not shown any of her
		natural gifts of leadership,
		자네에게 엘레노어만한 리더십은 없지만 
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	but under the circumstances,
		we shall have to make do, yes?
		상황이 이러니 없더라도 만들어야 한다, 알았나?
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:49	I'll... I'll do my best.
		최선을 다하겠습니다 
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	Ariel.
		에리얼 
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:53	Your keen lust for advancement
		will be gratified.
		승진하고 싶어 안달이 나 있었지 
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	Second seat for you.
		제 2주자는 자네다 
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	Yes, maestro.
		네, 마에스트로 
00:09:59	 
		 
00:10:00	All right everyone.
		좋습니다, 여러분 
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:02	Ready.
		준비하고 
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:04	From the top.
		처음부터 
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	And...
		자 
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:08	Attention.
		집중해!
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	Forte.
		포르테!
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:19	Yep. Orlando Yglesias.
		Orlando Yglesias
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	Okay. Thanks.
		알겠습니다, 감사합니다 
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:24	Gang Unit's gonna ask around,
		피해자 전 애인 찾는데 
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	check out where the
		victim's ex-boyfriend hangs.
		갱 전담반이 돌아다니며 탐문하겠대 
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	Good.
		좋아 
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:35	There you go.
		여기 있다
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:37	I can't eat this.
		이거 못 먹어요
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:39	- Why not?
		- I'm a vegetarian.
		- 왜?
		- 난 채식주의자라구요
00:10:42	 
		 
00:10:50	Now it's vegetarian.
		이제 채식이 됐군 
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:57	Hey. Pick that up.
		이봐, 줍지 못해?
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:00	You better not mess with Cho, man.
		조의 심기를 거스르지 않는게 좋아, 꼬맹아 
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	- He used to be an Avon Park Playboy.
		- You were a playboy?
		- Avon Park Playboy 출신이라구
		- 당신이?
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	Oh, yeah. That's right.
		진짜라니까 
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:06	Then you should know my dad...
		Lawrence Rome.
		그럼 우리 아버지를 알겠네, Lawrence Rome
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:09	Runs with the South Side Mafia.
		남부 마피아를 주름잡았다구 
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	Never heard of him.
		I'll be right back.
		처음 듣는데 곧 돌아올게 
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	Yeah.
		어
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:18	Wayne, I'm getting coffee.
		Want some?
		웨인, 커피 뽑으러 갈건데 필요한거 있어?
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	Uh, no, thanks.
		난 괜찮아 
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:36	Hey.
		이봐 
00:11:37	 
		 
00:12:17	Hey.
		이봐 
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:19	What is this? What?
		이게 뭐야?
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	"I want you, baby. Come to me"?
		"자기가 보고 싶어, 빨리 와"?
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:23	- Is this some kind of a joke?
		- I didn't send that.
		- 이거 혹시 농담이야?
		- 내가 안 보냈어
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	- Well, it's on your phone.
		- Well, my phone is on my desk.
		- 네 번호잖아
		- 내 폰 책상 위에 있는데 
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:28	Hey.
		너희 
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:30	Who's watching the kid?
		지금 애는 누가 보냐?
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:36	Hey!
		야! 
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:41	Nice try.
		멋진 시도였다
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:46	Let's go.
		가자
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:49	I had him.
		내가 잡았다
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	Yeah.
		그래 
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:55	- You can't do this. I'm a minor.
		- Too bad.
		- 미성년자한테 이러는 법이 어딨어
		- 못된 미성년자니까 
00:12:58	 
		 
00:13:00	I know I shouldn't have messed with you.
		열받게 한건 미안하지만 
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:03	I can't be here.
		여기 있을 수 없어요 
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	I gotta go, for real.
		저 가야돼요 진짜 
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:07	Gang Unit just called back.
		갱 전담반이 전화 줬어요 
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	They say Orlando's crew hangs
		올란도 패거리가 
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	- at 8th and Market.
		- We should go sit on it.
		- 8번가랑 상점가 근처에 돌아다닌대요
		- 가봐야겠군 
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	You're looking for
		Orlando Yglesias, right?
		올란도 이글레시아스를 찾아요?
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:15	I know him.
		He's from the neighborhood.
		그 사람 알아요 동네에서 자주 봤어요
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	You ain't gonna find him
		at 8th and Market.
		8번가나 상점가에선 절대 못 찾아요
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	Why not?
		왜?
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	'Cause that's where the hermanos hang.
		hermanos 구역이니까 그러죠
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	- Orlando's not with them no more.
		- Gang Unit says different.
		- 올란도는 거기 나왔어요
		- 전담반 얘기는 다르던데 
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	They don't know. Jumped into
		a new gang a couple months ago.
		모르는 소리 올란도는 몇달 전에 다른 갱단 들어갔어요
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	Yeah? Which one?
		그래? 어디?
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:31	Cut me loose, and I'll tell you.
		이거 풀어주면 말할게요 
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:35	The Loco Pimps.
		The Loco Pimps
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:38	House on Lex and Tremont...
		That's their spot.
		Lex와 Tremont가 교차로의 집이 아지트예요
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	Gang Unit says the
		information's six months old.
		전담반측 정보는 6개월 전의 것이니까
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	Kid could be right.
		Wouldn't hurt to check it out.
		애 말이 맞을지 몰라요 알아봐서 나쁠건 없겠어요 
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	Lex and Tremont's close.
		If Orlando doesn't show up,
		Lex나 Tremont가는 가까우니까 올란도가 안 나타나면
00:13:49	 
		 
00:13:49	we'll swing by the other location.
		바로 다른데를 찾아보면 되죠 
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	If you get him, you'll
		let me out, right?
		올란도 찾으면 나 보내주는 거죠?
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:54	Let's go.
		가지 
00:13:55	 
		 
00:14:08	You're dragging, people!
		질질 늘어지잖아! 
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:13	Stay in tempo!
		박자감있게! 
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:16	Off the string.
		스타카토, 날아가듯이! 
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:18	Off the string.
		경쾌하게! 
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:20	Stop!
		그만!
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Stop. Stop.
		그만, 그만 
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:24	Ariel.
		에리얼 
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:26	B-flat? It's ridiculous, even for you.
		아무리 자네라지만 B플랫은 너무 어이가 없군 
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:29	While we're on the subject,
		Ann, Carol, you're dragging.
		남들 잘하는데 앤, 캐롤 당신들은 늘어져
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:33	Trumpets, measure 37...
		트럼펫들, 
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	Soggy.
		질척거려
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:37	I thought it sounded
		perfectly lovely. Bravo.
		내가 듣기엔 정말 훌륭한걸요, 브라보 
00:14:39	 
		 
00:14:40	You're awfully picky, aren't you?
		당신은 진짜 트집쟁이 중의 트집쟁이로군 
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	Who are you?
		당신 누구야?
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:43	Never mind. Go. Leave. Now.
		모르겠고, 나가 여기서, 당장 
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	I'm with the CBI.
		I'm here about the murder.
		CBI에서 나왔습니다 살인사건 수사중이죠
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:49	Uh, if you'll please wait outside....
		그럼 좀 밖에 나가계시오 
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:51	- You hate being interrupted, don't you?
		- As a matter of fact, I do.
		- 방해받는걸 싫어하죠?
		- 사실을 말하자면 그렇다오 
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	Interesting.
		재미있네 
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	I have one question,
		then I'll leave.
		떠나기 전에 한가지만 물읍시다 
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	I know it was you that
		murdered Eleanor Artega.
		당신이 엘레노어를 죽였다는 걸 알아 
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	I just need to know why, Vincent.
		Why did you kill her?
		단지 왜 그래야 했는지가 궁금하네요, Vincent
		왜 죽였습니까?
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:06	You are crazy.
		당신 미쳤구만 
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:10	That is exactly... exactly what
		I thought you would say,
		내가 예상한 그대로 대답하시는군요 
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	now I know for sure.
		이젠 확실히 알겠어 
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:16	Yes.
		그래
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:18	You, sir,
		선생님은, 
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	are a cold-blooded murderer...
		냉혈한 살인자입니다 
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:23	And you will get what you deserve.
		그 댓가를 치르게 될 겁니다 
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	I did not kill Eleanor Artega.
		난 Eleanor Artega를 죽이지 않았어
00:15:28	 
		 
00:15:28	- Are you sure of that?
		- Very sure.
		- 정말입니까?
		- 정말이고말고 
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:32	Meh. Well, it's worth a try.
		음, 뭐, 그래도 던져볼만한 가치는 있었어요
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	- Worth a try?
		- Yeah, the old "It was you" gambit.
		- 뭘 던져?
		- "범인은 너야" 하고 한번 던져 보는거 있잖아요 
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:37	Guilty people often
		fold up at that point...
		사람이 죄책감이 있으면 거기서 드러나거든요
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	Guilty people with a
		conscience, that is,
		죄지은 사람들에게도 양심의 가책은 있죠 
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	which means you're either innocent,
		그 말인즉슨 당신은 결백하거나 
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:44	or you're a cold, heartless
		monster... or both.
		피도 눈물도 없는 괴물이거나 둘다거나 
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	This is an outrageous
		abuse of authority.
		정부에서 나왔다곤 해도 지독한 직권 남용이요
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Yes, yes, I know. Don't go
		getting on your high horse.
		나도 아니까 잘난척 좀 그만 하십쇼
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	It still might be you, and if it is...
		범인은 여전히 당신일 수 있으니까요 만약 그렇다면... 
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:59	Justice will find you.
		정의가 당신을 심판할 거야 
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:23	What?
		왜요?
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	We're wasting our time.
		Orlando's not gonna show up.
		시간 낭비야 올란도가 나타날리 없어 
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	The kid played us.
		꼬맹이가 우릴 엿먹인 거야 
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:28	Sounded like he knew
		what he was talking about.
		거짓말하는 것처럼 들리진 않았어요 
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	- He knows how to sell it.
		- Ah, he doesn't seem that bad to me.
		- 사기치는걸 아는거지 
		- 그렇게 나쁜 애 같진 않던데 
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:34	I used to be that kid.
		어릴때 내가 딱 그랬어 
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:36	Any chance to mess
		with a cop, I'd do it.
		경찰을 엿먹일 기회만 있으면 반드시 그렇게 했지 
00:16:38	 
		 
00:16:38	Hey, check it out.
		저거 보세요
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:49	- That's Orlando, isn't it?
		- Yeah. Go. Go.
		- 올란도 맞죠?
		- 그래, 가자
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:59	CBI.
		CBI다
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:01	Let me see your hands. Do it.
		두손을 보여라
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:07	Tell me about Eleanor.
		엘레노어에 대해 말해봐 
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:16	Orlando, you want to talk
		after spending the night
		구치소에서 하룻밤 잔 다음에야 
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	in a holding cell, that's your right,
		말하고 싶어지거든 그건 네 자유지만 
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:21	but tomorrow morning,
		내일 아침도 난 똑같이 
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	I am still gonna be asking
		you the same questions.
		똑같은 질문을 할거야 
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:26	What you want to know?
		뭘 알고 싶은거요?
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:28	You were an unlikely couple.
		엘레노어와 넌 어울리지 않았어 
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	Eleanor was in the orchestra.
		She was moving her way up.
		엘레노어는 오케스트라에 합류해 신분상승의 기회를 얻었지만
00:17:32	 
		 
00:17:32	You weren't.
		Then she dumps you.
		당신은 아니었고, 그래서 엘레노어가 당신을 찼지 
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	Must have been stressful.
		Did it make you angry?
		꽤 불쾌한 일이었을거야 그것 때문에 화가 났나? 
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:38	Yeah, here we go,
		jamming me up for this.
		나한테 뒤집어 씌우려고?
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	I'm just askin'.
		그냥 질문하는거야 
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	I wasn't angry.
		화낸적 없습니다 
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:45	Eleanor was all about music, always.
		엘레노어에겐 음악이 전부였어요 
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:48	Wasn't gonna let me or anyone
		else get in the way of that.
		나 아닌 다른 누구도 끼어들게 허락지 않았어요 
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:51	I respected that.
		난 그 뜻을 존중한 겁니다 
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:52	Then why'd you keep calling,
		going over to her apartment?
		그럼 왜 전화하고 집까지 찾아갔찌? 
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:56	We were cool. There was
		no reason not to hang.
		우린 쿨하게 헤어졌어요 매달릴 까닭이 없었어요
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Except a restraining order.
		접근금지 명령에 관한 것만 빼면 
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	Her mother made her
		do that. She told me.
		그건 엘레노어 엄마가 시킨거예요 직접 들었어요
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	Her mom thought I was mong
		in again 'cause I came by
		고작 몇번 스친것 가지고 
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:06	- a couple times.
		- If you're such a stand-up guy,
		- 그 엄마가 오버한 거예요 
		- 그렇게 떳떳하다면 
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	why did you run from the crime scene?
		왜 현장에서 도주했지? 
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	A cop calls me out, what I'm gonna do?
		경찰이 보자는데 난들 어떡합니까? 
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:15	I wouldn't hurt El.
		나는 엘한테 나쁜짓 안해요 
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:17	Didn't want nothin' but good for her.
		엘이 잘되기만 바랐어요 
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:20	Believe it, don't...
		내 말이 안 믿겨지겠지만 
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	I don't control you.
		우기지는 않겠어요 
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:26	I talked to the clerk
		접근금지 명령을 내린 판사의 비서와 
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:26	of the judge who issued
		the restraining order.
		연락해 봤는데 
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	Orlando's right.
		Eleanor did ask for it,
		올란도 말이 맞아요 엘레노어 본인이 신청했지만
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	but her mother was the driving force.
		이사벨라가 뒤에 있었어요
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	That's not what Isabella said.
		이사벨라 말과는 다른데 
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	Also, I checked Eleanor's e-mails.
		엘레노어 이메일을 보니 
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	Eleanor fired Isabella as her manager
		엘레노어는 어머니와 갈라서고 
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	and hired a new one
		just a couple weeks ago.
		몇주전 새 매니저를 고용했어요 
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:40	I bet that didn't go
		over well with the mom.
		그 엄마가 순순히 받아들였을 것 같진 않군 
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:42	New manager says Eleanor and
		her mother weren't speaking.
		매니저 말론 모녀간에 말도 안했대요
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	They spoke before she died.
		Go talk to Isabella again.
		죽기 전엔 아니었어 다시 가서 만나봐 
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	- Find out what they really said.
		- Okay, I'm on it.
		- 정말 뭐라고 하는지 들어봐 
		- 알겠습니다 
00:18:51	 
		 
00:18:54	You sleep here.
		여기서 자라 
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:57	The door will be locked,
		문은 밖에서 잠글거다 
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	but there's someone down the hall.
		하지만 밖에 사람이 있으니 
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	You need anything,
		just bang on the door, okay?
		뭔가 필요하거든 문을 두드리면 된다 
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:01	But I'm leaving tomorrow, right?
		내일 나가는거죠?
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	Depends on when juvenile
		services gets here.
		아동복지국 하는거 봐서 
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Juvenile services?
		You said you'd let me go
		아동 복지국? 올란도를 넘기면 
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	- if I gave you Orlando. We had a deal.
		- There was no deal.
		- 날 보내준다놓고, 약속했잖아요?
		- 그런거 한적 없어 
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	Come on, man.
		Don't punk out on me.
		이봐요, 나 빡치게 하지 마요 
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:13	I'm not kidding. I
		need to get out of here.
		장난 아니라 나 진짜 나가야 돼요 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Well, you should have thought of that
		남의 차를 훔치기 전에 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	- before you stole a car.
		- No, I've got business.
		- 그 정돈 고려했어야지 
		- 할 일이 있었단 말예요! 
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	It'll have to wait.
		나중에 천천히 하셔야겠군 
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	- Hey.
		- Let me go!
		- 이봐
		- 놔줘요!
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Get off me!
		놓으라고!
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Get off of me, man!
		이거 놔!
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	Let me go!
		이거 놔!
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	Hey. Stop. Stop.
		가만 있어 
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	- Easy.
		- Get off of me!
		- 가만 
		- 놓으라고!
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:37	Look at me. Look at me.
		내 눈 똑바로 봐 
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:43	What's this really about?
		진짜로, 다 어떻게 된거냐?
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:48	I'm not leaving until you tell me.
		말해주기 전까진 안 놓는다 
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:51	My dad got arrested.
		아빠가 잡혀갔어요 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:53	They say he robbed a liquor store,
		아빠가 술집을 털었다는데 
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:56	but he didn't.
		아빤 그런적 없어요 
00:19:57	 
		 
00:20:00	All right.
		그래
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	He didn't.
		아빤 안 그랬어요 
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:03	He's got an alibi...
		아빠한테는 알리바이가 있는데 
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:05	Dude named Jayden Stephens.
		Jayden Stephens란 놈이 알아요
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:08	But Jayden won't come forward.
		하지만 그 놈 나타나지 않을거예요 
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	He's got warrants out
		on him, so he's hiding.
		수배중이라 도망다니거든요 
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:13	But my dad's going on trial next week.
		그럼 우리 아빤 다음주에 재판 받아요
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:17	I can't find Jayden,
		내가 Jayden을 못 찾아내면,
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:19	my dad's going to prison.
		우리 아빤 감방에 갈 거예요
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:24	That's why I stole your car.
		그래서 차를 훔쳤어요 
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:26	Jayden's running with
		the true heights villains.
		Jayden은 진짜 못된 패거리랑 돌아다니니까 
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:29	I was thinking if
		I can jump in with them,
		내가 그 패거리에 낄 수만 있으면 
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:33	they'd tell me where he's hiding.
		Jayden이 어디 숨어있는지 알아낼 수 있을것 같았어요
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:36	Figured they'd know.
		놈들은 알것 같아서 
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:41	You were joining a gang to
		get your father out of prison.
		네 아버질 감방 안 가게 하려고 넌 갱단원이 되려 했다 
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:45	Yeah.
		네 
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:50	Try to get some sleep.
		좀 자 둬 
00:20:51	 
		 
00:21:09	We know Eleanor fired
		you as her manager.
		엘레노어가 당신더러 매니저를 하지 말라고 했다면서요 
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	- Why didn't you tell us that?
		- I didn't think it was important.
		- 왜 말씀하지 않으셨어요?
		- 중요한 얘기 같지 않아서요 
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:14	Well, you must've talked about it
		엘레노어가 여기 왔다 살해당한 밤 
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:15	the night Eleanor came
		here and she was killed.
		그 얘기를 하셨을거 아니에요 
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:19	We did.
		했어요
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:21	She wanted to make up. I didn't.
		애는 화해하고 싶어했지만 내가 안했어요
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:25	I should've, but I didn't.
		그랬어야 했지만 안했어요 
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:26	So the last time you spoke, you fought?
		그래서 마지막으로 만나셨을땐 싸우셨다? 
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:32	Are you asking if I killed my daughter?
		지금 내가 딸애를 죽였다는 건가요?
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	No, ma'am, I'm just trying
		아니요, 저는 사실 관계를
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	- to get the facts straight.
		- Yes, she is.
		- 정리하려는 것 뿐입니다
		- 실은 그 말이에요
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:41	I mean, come on, you are.
		음, 내 말은, 했잖아
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:46	Most kids never make it out
		of this neighborhood.
		여기 애들 대부분은 평생 여기서 못 벗어나요
00:21:48	 
		 
00:21:49	Eleanor did,
		엘레노어는 해냈죠 
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:51	because I gave her everything
		더 나은 삶을 살게끔 
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	so she could have a better life.
		그 앨 위해 내 전부를 희생했으니까
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:56	- Why would I hurt her?
		- Grace, it's clear as day.
		- 내가 어떻게 딸애를 해쳐요?
		- 그레이스, 이건 명백해 
00:21:59	 
		 
00:21:59	Isabella had nothing to do
		with her daughter's death.
		이사벨라는 딸애 죽음과 아무 관련이 없어 
00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	More importantly, was Eleanor into cats?
		그보다 중요한건, 따님이 고양이를 좋아했나요?
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:05	Cats? No.
		고양이요? 아니요
00:22:06	 
		 
00:22:06	What about ancient Egypt,
		pyramids? Mummies?
		고대 이집트는요? 미라라던지 피라밋 같은?
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:10	No. She never talked to me about Egypt.
		이집트에 관해 들은 적은 없는데요 
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:14	Okay.
		좋습니다 
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	Thanks. Let's roll.
		고맙습니다 우린 철수 
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:19	And I look forward to seeing all of you
		여기 계신 모든 여러분을 
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	tomorrow night as our
		73rd season begins.
		73회 연주시즌 초연의 밤에 다시 뵙기를 바랍니다 
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	So to all our donors, our board members,
		그럼 후원자, 이사회 여러분, 
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	our most loyal supporters,
		언제나 저희를 지지해 주시는 여러분, 
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:29	I say thank you.
		정말로 감사드립니다 
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:41	Is that for Ariel? More of a
		red wine girl, I would think.
		에리얼한테 갖다주려구요? 레드 와인파 같던데 
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:45	How'd you know this was for her?
		갖다주려는지 어떻게 아셨어요?
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:47	Well, clearly, you've got
		a thing for her.
		눈에 빤히 보이던데요
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	Word to the wise...
		She likes the bad boys.
		조언 하나 하죠 에리얼은 나쁜 남자에 끌리는 타입이에요
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:54	- Oh, you're back.
		- Mm.
		다시 오셨네요
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	- Don't let Vincent see you.
		- I think I can take him.
		- 마에스트로한테 들키면 죽어요
		- 그 사람 정도야 
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	So can I watch?
		That was fun last time.
		그럼 지켜봐도 돼요? 지난번엔 재밌었어요
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	This is not a joke, Ariel.
		이거 농담 아닙니다, 에리얼 
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	I'm following up on an important clue.
		나는 중요 단서를 쫓아온 겁니다 
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:05	It could very well break the case.
		사건 해결에 긴요한 역할을 할 단서죠 
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:09	Well, come on.
		그러지 마시고, 
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:13	You're gonna tell us, right?
		살짝 말해주실거죠?
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:16	- He can't, Ariel.
		- Oh, we won't say anything.
		- 못하셔, 에리얼 
		- 절대 비밀로 할게요 
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:19	Promise. I'd like to know.
		- 진짜로요
		- 저도 듣고 싶어요 
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:22	Well, I suppose you're
		gonna hear soon enough.
		조만간 듣게 되실 겁니다 
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:28	Eleanor was in a relationship
		with someone from the orchestra.
		엘레노어는 오케스트라 단원 누군가와 사귀고 있었어요 
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:33	I suspected as much.
		그럴 줄 알았어 
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:35	- Who was it?
		- Uh, I can't.
		- 누구예요?
		- 안돼요
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	It couldn't be Douglas, could it?
		더글라스는 아니겠지, 설마? 
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:40	- Or Howard?
		- Think bigger. That's all I'm saying.
		- 하워드?
		- 사고의 스케일을 키워봐요 그게 내가 줄 수 있는 최대 힌트니까
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:48	It wasn't...
		그럴리가... 
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:51	No.
		말도 안돼 
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	- Are you serious?
		- Deadly.
		- 진심으로 하는 말씀이세요?
		- 굉장히요
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:55	Mm.
		 
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:57	And he was abusing her...
		게다가 엘레노어를 학대했다죠... 
00:23:58	 
		 
00:24:00	sexually.
		성적으로다가 
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:01	That's awful.
		끔찍해라 
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	Yes. Shh.
		 
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:06	- Oh, my...
		- I don't see it.
		- 이걸 어째 
		- 난 몰랐네!
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:21	ID please.
		신분증 보여주십쇼 
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:22	Mr. Rome, I'm kimball Cho with the CBI.
		Rome씨, CBI의 킴벌 조입니다
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:25	Your son Anthony tells
		me you're innocent
		당신 아들 말론 
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:27	of the charge you're facing.
		Is that true?
		당신이 저지르지도 않은 일로 기소됐다는데 정말입니까? 
00:24:28	 
		 
00:24:28	Anthony told you that?
		안소니가 그러던가요? 
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:30	Yeah. How you know my son?
		- 그렇습니다
		- 내 아들은 어떻게 만났소?
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:32	That's not important right now.
		그게 중요한건 아니잖습니까 
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	Why the hell do you
		care about any of this?
		당신이 여기 신경쓰는 이유가 대체 뭐요?
00:24:36	 
		 
00:24:36	I'm giving you a chance to say
		you didn't do the crime.
		나는 죄를 짓지 않았다는 말을 할 기회를 드리는 겁니다 
00:24:38	 
		 
00:24:38	- You're not gonna take it?
		- No. No, I didn't do it.
		- 필요 없다는 겁니까? 
		- 아뇨, 난 아무 나쁜 짓도 안했소 
00:24:41	 
		 
00:24:41	DA says you did.
		지방 검사 말은 다르죠 
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:42	Yeah, a store owner
		picked me out of a lineup.
		그래요, 가게 주인이 날 지목했거든 
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:44	Bad witness ID that's all.
		But you know how hard
		멍청한 증인 하나면 한방에 가지 
		하지만 그걸 뒤집기 얼마나 어려운지 
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:46	that is to beat, right?
		당신도 알거 아뇨? 
00:24:47	 
		 
00:24:47	And you've robbed a lot
		of stores, haven't you?
		게다가 예전에는 제법 털어보셨죠, 아닙니까?
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:50	- Not anymore. That is all behind me.
		- Since when?
		- 더 이상은 아니오, 과거의 일이오
		- 언제부터요?
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:55	Since Anthony's mother
		passed about a year ago.
		몇년전 아이 엄마가 죽었을 때부터요 
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	I've been trying to step up, do better.
		그때부터 착실하게 살려고 마음 먹었소 
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:00	Look, I even got a new construction job.
		공사장에서 새로 일도 구했단 말요 
00:25:02	 
		 
00:25:03	And you run with the South Side Mafia.
		남부 마피아와 어울렸다면서 
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:06	How do they feel about you stepping up?
		손을 씻겠다니까 그들이 뭐랍니까? 
00:25:07	 
		 
00:25:09	I'm jumping out as soon as
		I put all this behind me.
		지금 일만 해결되는대로 그쪽과 연을 끊을거요 
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:11	You've had a year to jump out.
		연 끊는데만 1년을 미적거렸죠 
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:12	- What are you waiting for?
		- Man, the hell with you!
		- 뭣하러 그런겁니까? 
		- 지옥에나 가라지! 
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	You don't know me!
		당신은 아무것도 몰라! 
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:18	DA offered you two years.
		You could do that much time easily.
		지방검사는 2년을 제안했죠 긴 시간은 아닙니다 
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:22	- Why'd you turn it down?
		- Two years
		- 왜 거절한 겁니까? 
		- 2년간 내 아들이 
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	of my boy in foster care,
		out there on the streets?
		입양가정을 전전하거나 거리로 나돌면 
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	He would be dead or in a cell with me.
		죽거나 내 옆 감방에 들어오게 될거요 
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:29	No. I been gone too long.
		이미 애를 오래 혼자 두었소
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:32	I have got to get outta here.
		난 여기서 나가야 한단 말요 
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:38	Tell me about Jayden Stephens.
		Jayden Stephens에 대해 말해 봐요
00:25:40	 
		 
00:25:46	I got your message.
		문자 받았어 
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:48	- Just in time. The fun will soon begin.
		- What's going on?
		- 딱 재밌는거 시작할때 맞춰 왔네 
		- 뭔데?
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	Ahem. It's just horrible, isn't it?
		너무 끔찍해요, 안 그래요?
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:53	- What is, ma'am?
		- Our conductor...
		- 무슨 일이 말입니까?
		- 아니 우리 지휘자가 
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:57	has been having an illicit relationship
		그 불쌍한 엘레노어양과 
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:00	- with our poor, dear Eleanor.
		- No.
		- 불륜관계였다지 뭐예요 
		- 어머나
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:03	Yes.
		진짜라니까요
00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:04	And he hit her.
		게다가 엘레노어를 폭행했대요 
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:08	Allison! Excuse me.
		Allison! 실례할게요
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	You're excused.
		실례하세요
00:26:11	 
		 
00:26:13	You. Why?
		너지 왜 그랬냐?
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:15	Lure out the real lover.
		진짜 불륜남녀를 캐치하려고 
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:18	Oops. Gotta go.
		웁스, 따라가야겠다 
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:24	Someone in the orchestra had
		단원 가운데 누군가 
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	a passionate and
		unrequited crush on Eleanor.
		엘레노어에게 뜨거운 감정을 갖고 있었어
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	And you know this because?
		어떻게 알았어?
00:26:29	 
		 
00:26:29	Cats and Egypt...
		Eleanor wasn't into them.
		고양이나 이집트 엘레노어의 취향이 아니었지 
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:32	The bookmark... She didn't
		buy it for herself,
		책갈피를 본인이 사진 않았을거야 
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	and it's too expensive
		for a casual gift.
		게다가 그건 편히 주기엔 너무 값비싼 물건이지 
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	Someone was trying very
		hard to impress her.
		누군가 환심을 얻으려 했다는 증거야 
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	Now thanks to the rumor
		mill, that person thinks
		소문이 일파만파 퍼졌으니 
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	that Vincent was sleeping with Eleanor.
		그 사람은 지휘자가 엘레노어와 잤다고 생각하겠지 
00:26:43	 
		 
00:26:44	Add in a couple of glasses of champagne,
		거기다 샴페인 몇 잔이 들어가고 
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	and if I haven't missed the mark...
		내가 충분히 주의깊게 살폈다면... 
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:46	You son of a bitch. How could you
		do that to Eleanor?
		이 개자식, 엘레노어한테 어떻게 그런 짓을? 
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:50	I have no idea what
		you're talking about.
		자네가 뭐라는지 전혀 이해할 수 없네 
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Don't lie to me.
		거짓말 마 
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:53	- Here we go.
		- Go home and sober up.
		- 보시랍 
		- 집에 가서 술이나 깨고 오시지 
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	- Aah!
		- Ooh.
		 
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:58	That's enough!
		Get off of him! Come on!
		그만하세요! 떨어지세요!
00:27:00	 
		 
00:27:00	Now. Break it up!
		Break it up now!
		놓고 떨어지세요!
00:27:02	 
		 
00:27:02	Break it up.
		떨어져요!
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:06	Oh! Break it up!
		Enough! Enough!
		그만하면 됐어요!
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	Let me know if you need me
		to call for backup.
		혹시 지원 필요하면 말해 
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:13	Oh! Hey!
		I said, get your hands off!
		그 손 떼시라구요 
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:21	Constance, we know you
		bought Eleanor that bookmark.
		콘스탄스, 엘레노어에게 책갈피를 선물한건 당신이죠 
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:25	We found the charge on
		your credit card records.
		신용카드 거래내역에서 확인했어요 
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:28	You were in love with her, weren't you?
		엘레노어를 좋아했죠, 그렇죠?
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:31	Yes, I was.
		그랬어요 
00:27:33	 
		 
00:27:34	When did you tell her?
		언제 말했나요?
00:27:35	 
		 
00:27:37	A few weeks ago.
		몇주 전에요 
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:40	She was really, really nice, but...
		엘레노어는 정말 좋은 사람이었지만 
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:45	she wasn't interested.
		그쪽으로 흥미가 없었어요
00:27:46	 
		 
00:27:46	Did that upset you?
		그래서 화가 났나요?
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:49	I suppose a little.
		조금요 
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:51	Mm. You have a temper, don't you?
		좀 울컥하는 성미가 있죠 
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:54	No. Hardly at all.
		전혀요
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Oh, you got pretty angry at Vincent.
		빈센트한테는 아니던데요 
00:27:59	 
		 
00:27:59	That was different.
		그건 달라요 
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:01	I... I thought...
		저는... 전 
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:03	I heard vinct hurt Eleanor.
		빈센트가 엘레노어를 때렸다고 들었어요 
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	I... I didn't think that was right.
		그런 일은 나빠요
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	And what about the night Eleanor died?
		엘레노어가 죽던 날 밤에는요?
00:28:10	 
		 
00:28:10	Did you have a temper then?
		그때도 울컥했나요?
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:14	You knew she was playing that night.
		엘레노어 독주회가 있는줄 알고 있었죠 
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	It wouldn't have been that
		엘레노어의 뒤를 밟는 일은 
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	- hard to follow her.
		- You can't be serious.
		- 그리 어렵지 않았겠죠
		- 진심으로 하는 말씀은 아니죠
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:19	I don't think the fact that
		Vincent had abused Eleanor
		내가 보기 당신은 빈센트가 엘레노어를 학대했기 때문에 
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	is what upset you.
		화가 난 것 같지 않아요 
00:28:23	 
		 
00:28:24	I think you couldn't stand her
		being with somebody else.
		엘레노어가 다른 사람과 있는걸 볼 수 없었던 거죠 
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	No.
		아니예요 
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:28	All right, then explain
		this for me then.
		좋아요, 그럼 이거 해명해 봐요 
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:37	Why was the gun that
		killed Eleanor in your car?
		엘레노어를 죽인 총이 왜 당신 차에 있죠?
00:28:40	 
		 
00:28:41	What?
		네?
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:42	A few hours ago,
		we found it in your trunk.
		몇시간전 우리가 차 트렁크에서 발견했어요
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:47	That isn't mine.
		제거 아니에요
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:49	It's...
		제거... 
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:50	Th... that's not mine. It isn't.
		제거 아니에요 아니라구요 
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	That's not really an explanation
		of how it got there.
		총이 왜 거기 있었는지에 대한 좋은 설명은 아니네요 
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:58	I...
		전 
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:59	I... I want a lawyer.
		변호사 불러주세요
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:01	Please.
		제발요 
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:16	So... Constance.
		그래서, 콘스탄스는?
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:18	We're charging her.
		기소했어 
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:20	Then we can all rest easy.
		그럼 우리 모두 발뻗고 잘 일만 남았군 
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	Mm.
		 
00:29:23	 
		 
00:29:26	Say it.
		무엇이 못마땅하신가?
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:28	She didn't do it.
		그녀가 죽인게 아니야 
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:29	We found the weapon in her car.
		차에서 총도 나왔는데 
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:32	Didn't do it.
		안 죽였다니까 
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	Unless you have actual
		evidence that exonerates her,
		그럼 무죄임을 증명할 증거를 갖고 와 봐 
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	- we have to charge her.
		- If she were the killer,
		- 안 그럼 기소해야 돼 
		- 정말 콘스탄스가 범인이라면 
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	she would have exhibited
		some measure of guilt.
		죄책감의 징표가 나타났어야 해 
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:41	All I observed was sincere grief.
		하지만 내가 본 건 진실한 슬픔 뿐이었어
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:46	Actual evidence.
		증거
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:49	Okay. The gauntlet's been thrown down.
		좋아, 그 도전 받아들이겠어 
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:55	When you searched Constance's
		car, did you notice any flowers?
		콘스탄스의 차를 뒤질때 꽃이 있던가? 
00:29:58	 
		 
00:29:58	No. Why?
		아니, 왜? 
00:29:59	 
		 
00:30:00	She's all yours.
		이젠 맘대로 하세요
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:04	Hey, Osvaldo.
		여어, 오즈왈드 
00:30:06	 
		 
00:30:06	How's it going in the DA's office?
		지방검사 노릇은 좀 어때?
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	Not so good. We need
		to talk about Agent Cho.
		별로야 조 요원 좀 만나게 해줘 
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:12	Ardiles is prosecuting Rome.
		Ardiles는 Rome씨를 기소했어 
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:15	I'm told you visited Rome in jail.
		Is that true?
		Rome씨를 면회하러 갔다던데 맞습니까? 
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	- Why do you wanna know?
		- Why...
		- 묻는 이유가 뭡니까? 
		- 왜냐니 
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:23	Uh, because Mr. Rome's
		lawyer has sent me
		왜냐면 롬씨 변호사가 
00:30:25	an updated witness list
		 
		제이든 스티븐스 이름이 들어간 
00:30:26	with the name Jayden Stephens on,
		which is interesting,
		 
		새로 갱신된 증인 목록을 보내왔는데 재밌는건, 
00:30:29	because as far as I can tell,
		Jayden Stephens
		 
		내가 아는 한에 제이든 스티븐스란 인물은 
00:30:32	is a convenient figment
		of Mr. Rome's imagination.
		 
		롬의 상상 속 인물이란 말이지 
00:30:34	But now according to Mr. Rome's lawyer,
		 
		하지만 롬씨 변호사 말로는 
00:30:36	even though you have
		nothing to do with this,
		 
		요원이 이 사건과 하등 관련이 없음에도 
00:30:39	you said you'd track
		down this Mr. Stephens,
		 
		스티븐스를 잡아오겠다고 말했다는 거요 
00:30:41	thereby providing
		Mr. Rome with an alibi,
		 
		그럼으로서 롬의 알리바이를 증명하고 
00:30:43	potentially screwing my case.
		 
		내 사건 하나를 엎으려는 거지 
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:48	That's why I need to know, Agent Cho.
		그래서 물어보려는 거요, 요원 
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	Answer him.
		대답해드려 
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:54	Yes, I did that.
		그랬습니다 
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:58	Agent, do you know who, uh,
		요원, 그렇다면 
00:31:00	- Asante James and Rodrick Pierce are?
		- No.
		 
		- Asante James와 Rodrick Pierce이 누군지 압니까?
		- 모릅니다
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:04	Well, they're only the, uh, top two
		lieutenants in the South Side Mafia.
		South Side Mafia의 주요 간부들이요
00:31:08	Probably a dozen bodies on each.
		 
		각각 여러 사람 죽인 놈들이지 
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	Lawrence Rome worked with them.
		Lawrence Rome은 그자들과 한패였소 
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:13	You want Lawrence to flip?
		Lawrence를 일부러 풀어줄거구나 
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	- Well, that's the idea.
		- Lawrence won't flip.
		- 그럴 계획이지 
		- 돌아가지 않을 겁니다 
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	- Really? Why not?
		- He knows they'd kill him.
		- 왜?
		- 돌아가면 죽는단걸 아니까요 
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	Right. And you know
		so much about that?
		이 사건에 대해 많이 아시나보군? 
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:20	More than you, I guess.
		당신보다는 조금 더 안다고 생각합니다
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:23	Agent, do I have to take this upstairs?
		요원, 내가 이걸 윗선으로 갖고 가길 바랍니까?
00:31:25	- Because I'm ready.
		- No, you don't.
		 
		- 난 바로 그럴 수 있거든 
		- 그러지 마 
00:31:27	Hey, this is not our
		case. Rome's attorney
		 
		이건 우리 사건 아니잖아 
00:31:30	or the DA'S office can
		look for Jayden Stephens.
		 
		롬 변호사나 지방검사 사무소에서 제이든 스티븐스 일은 알아서 할거야 
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	We should not get involved.
		우린 여기 관여하는거 아냐 
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:37	Good.
		좋습니다 
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:40	Then we're in agreement.
		그럼 이걸로 합의한거군 
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:42	We shouldn't get involved.
		우린 여기 관여하지 않는다 
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:44	Got it.
		알겠습니다 
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:59	Where's the kid?
		아이는? 
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	Juvenile services just took him.
		아동복지국 사람이 데려가던데
00:32:01	 
		 
00:32:03	- Let go of me, man. Man, let go of me!
		- Listen, zip your mouth.
		- 이거 놔요!
		- 입 다물어
00:32:06	- Let go of me!
		- Hey! Hold on.
		 
		- 놓으라구요!
		- 이봐요, 잠깐!
00:32:08	Listen to me, pal.
		Easy, son, easy. What's up?
		 
		가만히 있지 못해? 무슨 일입니까?
00:32:12	 
		 
00:32:12	I'm Agent Cho. I'll take
		the kid off your hands.
		조 요원입니다 애를 돌려주시오 
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	What?
		뭐라구요?
00:32:15	 
		 
00:32:15	I made a mistake. Let's just
		forget I filed a report, okay?
		착오가 있습니다 내가 보고서 작성을 잊었습니다 
00:32:17	Too late. Paperwork's been filed.
		 
		늦었어요 서류 이미 들어갔어요 
00:32:19	It's my case now. Besides, it
		took me an hour to get here.
		 
		이제 내 사건이요 게다가 여기 오는데 한시간도 더 걸렸소 
00:32:22	I'm not going back empty-handed.
		Now do you mind?
		 
		빈 손으론 돌아갈 수 없소 그럼? 
00:32:26	 
		 
00:32:29	- Hey, hey.
		- Give him to me.
		이리 줘요
00:32:29	Sorry. Can't do that.
		 
		죄송하지만 안되겠습니다 
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	- He hit you. That's battery.
		- Are you kidding me?
		- 방금 당신을 쳤으니 폭행죄입니다
		- 지금 장난쳐요?
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	- I have to process him now. Paperwork.
		- Hold on.
		- 당장 우리 절차를 따릅니다 서류 작업이란 거죠
		- 이봐요
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	- Bye.
		- Hey. This is bull!
		- 잘 가세요
		- 이게 말이 돼요!
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	What are you doing, man?
		지금 뭐하시는 거예요?
00:32:40	 
		 
00:32:40	Be quiet or I'll give you back.
		입 다물지 않으면 도로 보내버린다 
00:32:42	 
		 
00:33:03	I thought the police work was over.
		수사는 끝난걸로 아는데요
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:05	Oh, I just stopped by
		to congratulate you.
		축하해주러 들렀어요
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:08	I'm sorry. Me?
		죄송한데, 저를요?
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:10	You are the new
		concertmaster, aren't you?
		콘서트마스터잖아요
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:12	Now that Constance is in the pokey.
		콘스탄스도 감방 가겠다 
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	Thanks.
		고마워요 
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:17	It's not exactly something
		that deserves congratulations.
		축하 받을 일은 아니네요 
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:21	When you heard about the promotion,
		콘서트마스터직을 맡게 되었다는 말을 듣고 
00:33:22	what was the first thought
		that popped into your head?
		 
		가장 먼저 떠오른 생각이 뭐였나요?
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:25	Sadness... relief.
		슬픔하고 안도감 
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	You know, just last week
		I was thinking of leaving here
		실은 지난주까지만 해도 여기 그만두고 
00:33:31	and trying my luck elsewhere.
		 
		딴데 알아보려 했어요 
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:34	- Now...
		- Mm. Well, yougot what you wanted.
		- 이젠 
		- 이젠 원하던걸 얻었네요 
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:39	You're pleased and...
		yet you feel guilty.
		기쁘지만 한편으로 죄책감이 듭니다 
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	It's perfectly understandable.
		능히 이해할 수 있습니다 
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:45	I need to get back to rehearsing.
		그럼 마저 연습해야 해서 
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	Don't mind me.
		신경쓰지 마세요 
00:33:49	 
		 
00:34:05	Excuse me.
		죄송합니다만 
00:34:07	 
		 
00:34:07	Do you know if there's
		a good florist nearby?
		근처에 괜찮은 꽃집이 있나요?
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:24	- Jayden Stephens?
		- Who wants to know?
		- 제이든 스티븐스?
		- 그러는 당신은 누구요?
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	Hey, CBI. Let me see your hands.
		CBI다 손을 보여라 
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	All right.
		좋아 
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:32	We're gonna talk about Lawrence Rome.
		Lawrence Rome에 대해서다
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	We can talk. Let's talk.
		그러쇼, 물어보쇼
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:47	Give me your arms!
		Give me your arms!
		손 이리 내! 
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:57	Get up.
		일어나
00:34:58	 
		 
00:35:00	What the hell's going on here?
		당신 지금 여기서 뭐하는 거야?
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	- Get outta the way.
		- Or what?
		- 길 비켜
		- 싫다면?
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:06	Keep breathing. You'll be fine.
		숨쉬다 보면 덜 아파져 
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:15	For you.
		받아
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:18	Does it squirt water?
		이거 안에서 물 찍 나오고 그러는거?
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	No. No trick.
		그런거 없어 
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:23	Maybe just a little trick.
		Catch the killer.
		있다면 범인을 잡기 위한 사소한 장치 
00:35:25	- With a hydrangea?
		- Yeah.
		 
		- 수국으로?
		- 예압 
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	How?
		어떻게? 
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:29	Well, wouldn't that be spoiling the fun?
		가장 재미있는 부분을 가르쳐 줄 순 없잖아? 
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:30	For you.
		Spoiling the fun for you.
		너잖아 여기서 제일 재미있어 하는 사람은 
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	That's the fun that matters.
		그러니까 중요하지 
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:45	We're dropping charges
		against Lawrence Rome.
		Lawrence Rome에 대한 기소를 취하했소
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:51	I see.
		압니다 
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:53	Personally, I think the alibi is bogus,
		알리바이는 엉터리라고 생각하지만 
00:35:55	but we had to interview
		the store owner again.
		 
		가게 주인을 다시 만나봐야 했지 
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:57	Now he says, uh,
		maybe his ID was wrong.
		그러자 이젠 자기 증언이 틀렸을지 모른다는군 
00:35:59	Maybe it wasn't Lawrence Rome.
		 
		Lawrence Rome가 아니었던 것 같다면서
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:02	Whole thing's gone down the toilet.
		모든 일이 수포가 됐어 
00:36:04	 
		 
00:36:05	We had an agreement.
		약속했었잖아 
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:07	I agreed I shouldn't help.
		Didn't say I wouldn't.
		해선 안된다는데는 합의했지만 안한다곤 안했습니다 
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:09	From now on, you get nothing
		from the DA's office.
		지금부터 당신은 우리한테 밉보였어
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	No favors, no help...
		아무 편의도 도움도 못 받을거야 
00:36:15	Not just you, but every
		agent in this unit.
		 
		당신 하나만이 아니라 이 부서 전체가 말이야 
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:18	You have screwed things
		for your people, my friend.
		당신이 동료들 전부 엿먹인 거라구, 이 친구야
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:21	Six months from now,
		Lawrence Rome will be
		6개월 뒤면 
00:36:23	back inside for ripping
		off another liquor store,
		 
		로렌스는 또다른 술집을 털거야 
00:36:25	his kid'll be back in foster care,
		 
		아이는 입양 가정으로 들어갈거고 
00:36:27	and the South Side Mafia
		 
		South Side Mafia는 
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	- will be stronger than ever.
		- You're wrong.
		- 예전보다 더 세력이 강해지겠지 
		- 그렇지 않을 겁니다 
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:33	You wanna bet on that?
		장담할 수 있나? 
00:36:34	 
		 
00:37:04	On the stage,
		무대 위랑 
00:37:05	on the other side of the stairs.
		 
		계단 쪽에다가 놓아 주세요
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:20	Oh, no, no, no, no!
		아냐, 아냐! 
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:22	Stop! Stop! Stop!
		그만! 
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	Kieran!
		Kieran!
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:26	You're my rock! Never a wrong note.
		What is going on?!
		한번도 안 틀리고 늘 잘해왔잖아, 무슨 일이야!
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:29	I'm sorry, maestro, just...
		I'm not feeling very well.
		죄송합니다, 마에스트로 그냥 좀 몸이 안 좋네요
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:32	What is the matter?
		대체 뭐야?
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:34	- I can answer that.
		- What's he doing here?
		- 제가 설명할 수 있습니다 
		- 저 사람은 여기서 뭐해?
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:38	Fabulous suit, by the way.
		그건 그렇고 옷이 멋지네요
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:40	Kieran's not so much feeling
		sick as he is feeling guilty...
		Kieran은 죄책감 때문에 불편해 하는 겁니다 
00:37:42	Sick with guilt because
		it was him that killed Eleanor.
		 
		그야말로 엘레노어를 죽인 사람이니까요 
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:48	Come on.
		이봐요 
00:37:49	 
		 
00:37:49	Hydrangeas don't lie.
		수국은 거짓말을 하지 않죠 
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:54	Well, if they could speak,
		they wouldn't lie.
		말이야 못하겠지만 따라서 거짓말도 못하죠 
00:37:56	 
		 
00:37:57	What are you talking about?
		뭐라는 거요,그래서?
00:37:58	 
		 
00:37:58	Somebody gave Eleanor
		a bouquet of hydrangeas
		그날밤 누군가 엘레노어에게 
00:38:00	the night of the murder.
		 
		수국 꽃다발을 주었습니다 
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:05	After you shot Eleanor, you swiped them,
		당신을 엘레노어를 쏴죽이고 꽃다발을 집어가면서 
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:09	leaving behind a single petal.
		꽃잎 한장을 흘렸어 
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:13	And when you saw them,
		다시 수국을 보자 
00:38:14	you couldn't help
		remembering that night.
		 
		그날 밤이 생각나 
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:16	You felt guilty.
		It killed your concentration.
		죄책감을 견딜 수 없어지고 집중력을 잃은거지 
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:21	Come on. Constance killed her.
		You found the gun in her car.
		범인은 콘스탄스잖아요 차에서 총도 나왔다고
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:23	Because you framed her.
		당신이 모함한거지 
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:25	Precisely.
		The question remains...
		바로 그거야 남은 문제는... 
00:38:27	why would a man kill
		the first chair violinist
		 
		왜 그는 제1주자를 살해하고 
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:31	and then frame the second chair?
		제2주자에게 누명을 씌웠을까?
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:33	Because with the first and second chair
		이유는 수석주자와 제2주자가 사라져줘야만
00:38:35	out of the picture,
		the third takes first.
		 
		3등이 수석이 될 수 있기 때문이지 
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:38	Ariel. Kieran here has
		a little crush on you.
		에리얼, 여기 Kieran은 당신을 좋아합니다 
00:38:41	Well, let's not beat around
		the bush here, Kieran.
		 
		솔직해지자구요
00:38:44	It's more of an obsession.
		He'd heard that you'd been thinking
		 
		집착 이상의 감정이었죠 
		당신이 여기 오케스트라를 그만둘지 모른다는 것을 알자 
00:38:47	about leaving the orchestra.
		Then he would lose you.
		 
		당신을 잃을 수 없다 생각한 겁니다 
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	- So he had to shake things up.
		- Kieran?
		- 그래서 앞선 주자를 정리해야 했던 거예요 
		- Kieran?
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:54	It's not true. Okay, this is because
		아니야, 고작 내가 지금 음표 하나 틀렸다고 
00:38:56	I played a few wrong notes?
		This is crazy!
		 
		사람을 이렇게 몰아가기야?
00:38:57	 
		 
00:38:57	He told you that you'd eventually
		become first chair, didn't he?
		당신은 반드시 수석주자가 될거라 말한 적이 있죠?
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:00	It was just a feeling that
		he had, a little hunch.
		그는 강하게 믿었죠
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:04	He always had faith in you.
		당신을 늘 믿었어요 
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:07	- Ariel.
		- You stay away from me.
		- 에리얼
		- 나한테 다가오지 마 
00:39:09	No, Ariel. Wait, Ariel, wait.
		No, no. Wait. Wait.
		 
		안돼, 에리얼 안돼, 안돼 
00:39:10	- Ariel, listen. No, Ariel. Ariel! Ariel, wait!
		- No! Calm down.
		 
		- 에리얼, 내 말 들어봐! 안돼! 
		- 진정하세요 
00:39:13	- I just want to make you happy!
		- That's enough.
		 
		- 널 행복하게 해주고 싶었어!
		- 이걸로 충분하군요 
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	- Maestro, take five.
		- Okay.
		- 마에스트로, 5분 휴식합시다
		- 좋소 
00:39:18	Break, everyone.
		 
		그럼 해산 
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:20	Eleanor was nothing compared to Ariel.
		엘레노어는 에리얼에 비하면 아무것도 아니었어 
00:39:22	She didn't have the technique.
		 
		엘레노에에겐 기교가 없었어요 
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:24	So after rehearsal that night,
		I followed Eleanor
		그날밤 리허설을 마치고 엘레노어의 독주회까지 
00:39:27	to her performance.
		 
		몰래 뒤를 밟았어요
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:48	Why'd you take the flowers?
		왜 꽃을 가져간거죠?
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:50	He didn't think Eleanor deserved them.
		Isn't that right?
		엘레노어에겐 당치 않다 생각했으니까 그렇죠?
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	Ariel is ten times the player.
		에리얼은 지금 사람들이 알아주는 것보다 
00:39:56	She deserved the recognition.
		 
		열배는 더 훌륭한 연주자예요 
00:39:59	 
		 
00:40:00	If I had to give it to her,
		내가 그렇게 만들어줄 수 있다면 
00:40:02	 
		 
00:40:03	so be it.
		해야지요 
00:40:04	 
		 
00:40:05	Very gallant.
		용감무쌍하구만 
00:40:06	 
		 
00:40:07	Still, I wouldn't expect a conjugal.
		글쎄, 이 정도로 헌신적이었을 줄이야 
00:40:10	 
		 
00:40:14	Dad!
		아빠!
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:20	Oh, what's up, man?
		어떻게 지내셨어요!
00:40:21	 
		 
00:40:23	I missed you so much.
		정말 보고 싶었다
00:40:25	 
		 
00:40:26	Oh! Look at you.
		God, look at you.
		오, 요 녀석 
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:28	Come on.
		이 녀석 
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:31	I missed you.
		보고 싶었다 
00:40:33	 
		 
00:40:35	Lawrence.
		로렌스 
00:40:36	 
		 
00:40:38	All right. Give me a minute.
		잠시만 기다리렴 
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:41	Okay.
		 
00:40:42	 
		 
00:40:45	I talked to the Gang Unit.
		갱 전담반에 말해놨습니다 
00:40:47	 
		 
00:40:47	If you haven't jumped out in a month,
		당신이 한달이 지나도 거기 정리 안하면
