00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:22	Mom and dad are sitting outside
		우리 엄마랑 아빠가 밖에
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	with the neighbors
		they used to hate
		이웃들과 앉아있어
		지금껏 구역질 내던 사람들이
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	yukking it up
		like they're all best friends.
		최고의 친구들 처럼 보여.
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	And why?
		왜일까?
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	Because there's wine?
		와인 때문에?
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:29	No.
		Because of art.
		아니.
		예술 때문이야.
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:32	That statue that was so offensive

		could bring people together?
		누나 이것도 사람들을 
		함께하게 만들 수 있을까?
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	It's a self portrait of
		"my junk."
		"my junk."의 초상화야
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:49	Never speak to me again.
		다신 말 걸지마.
