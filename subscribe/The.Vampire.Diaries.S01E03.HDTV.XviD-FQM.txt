00:00:00	Previously on the Vampire Diaries...
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:02	For over a century, I have lived in secret, until now.
		한세기를 걸쳐 나는
		비밀을 가진채 살아왔다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:05	I know the risk, but I have to know her.
		내가 감수하게될 위험은 알지만
		그녀를 알아야만 한다
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	I'm Elena. 
		엘레나야
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	I'm Stefan.
		스테판이야
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:09	I know. 
		알아
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:10	I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.
		데이먼이에요
		스테판의 형
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	He didn't tell me he had a brother.
		형이 있는지 말 안해줬는데
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	Being around her. Being her world. She makes you alive.
		그녀 곁을 맴돌며 함께하면
		살아있는 것처럼 느껴지겠지
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:16	He told me about your ex, Katherine. She broke your heart
		네 마음을 아프게한 전 여친
		캐더린에 대해서 얘기하더라
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	It was a long time ago.
		오래 전 일이야
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:20	I'm gonna give you Elena's cell number.
		엘레나 휴대폰 번호 알려줄게
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:24	What are you up to?
		무슨 꿍꿍이야?
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	You have no idea the game I'm about to play.
		내가 어떤 게임을 하려는지
		너는 감도 못잡을걸
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	I was hoping I'd see you again.
		다시 보길 바랬어요
00:00:30	 
		 
00:02:09	Good morning. 
		좋은 아침
00:02:12	 
		 
00:02:12	Please...
		제발...
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	Don't.
		안돼요!
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:15	Don't do that.
		그러지 마요!
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:20	Ah, ah, ah.
		 
00:02:21	 
		 
00:02:22	No! No!
		안돼!
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	No!
		 
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:26	Get away from me! No!
		저리 가란 말야!
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:28	This could have gone a completely different way.
		네가 그러지만 않았어도
		달랐을텐데

00:02:55	I'm not saying don't date the guy.
		그 남자를 사귀지 말라는 게 아냐
00:02:57	 
		 
00:02:57	I'm just saying take it slow.
		그냥 늦추란 거지
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	You were the one who said to go for it.
		적극적으로 가보라며
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:00	Now I'm saying take it slow.
		이젠 천천히 사귀라고?
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:03	Why the about-face?
		왜 갑자기 태도를 바꿔?
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	It's not an about-face.
		태도를 바꾼게 아냐
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	You're single for the first time
		넌 3년만에 최초로
		싱글이 됐어
00:03:07	 
		넌 3년만에 최초로
		싱글이 됐어
00:03:07	in your entire high school career.
		넌 3년만에 최초로
		싱글이 됐어
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	It's the perfect time to play the field.
		네가 원하는대로 맘껏 즐길
		완벽한 기회야
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	Oh, because I'm so that girl.
		난 딱 그런 애라서?
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	Seriously, what are you not saying?
		진짜 무슨 말이야?
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:14	It's stupid.
		바보 같아
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	Bonnie...
		보니
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:16	What? Spit it out.
		왜? 말해 봐
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	I accidentally touched Stefan
		스테판 손을 우연히 만졌는데
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	And got a really bad feeling.
		정말 느낌이 안 좋았어
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:24	Is that it?
		그게 다야?
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	Bonnie.
		보니
00:03:27	 
		 
00:03:27	It was bad bad!
		정말 나빴다고!
00:03:28	 
		 
00:03:28	Is the whole witch mojo thing again?
		또 바보같은 마녀 얘기 때문이야?
00:03:30	 
		 
00:03:30	You know what? I'm just concerned.
		걱정되서 그래
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:32	This is me expressing concern
		나는 내 단짝의 남친에 대한
		걱정을 표현하는 거라구
00:03:33	 
		나는 내 단짝의 남친에 대한
		걱정을 표현하는 거라구
00:03:33	about my best friend's new boyfriend.
		나는 내 단짝의 남친에 대한
		걱정을 표현하는 거라구
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	And I love you for it, I do.
		그래줘서 정말 고마워
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	But I feel good.
		하지만 난 괜찮아
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	It's been a hard year,
		정말 힘든 한해였지만
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	and I'm starting to kind of feel like
		나는 이제
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:45	things are getting back to normal again.
		모든게 정상으로 돌아가는 듯한
		느낌이 든단 말야
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.
		스테판의 공이 컸어
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:54	I rock. I scored 2 tickets
		나 정말 대단하지
		토요일 밤 The Posers 공연
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:57	to the posers Saturday night.
		티켓 2장 구했다
00:03:58	 
		 
00:03:58	They're playing at the rat.
		Rat 에서 공연할거래
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	You and Tyler have fun.
		너랑 타일러 재미있게 관람해
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:01	Don't be like that.
		그러지 마
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	Come on. I want you to go.
		어서. 네가 가길 바란다구
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	You're not worried everyone's going to know
		마약쟁이 얼간이랑
		같이 잔 걸
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	you're screwing the stoner geek?
		애들이 알까봐 걱정 안돼?
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:08	Oh, wait... everyone already knows.
		맞다.. 이젠 전교생이 알지
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:10	Yeah. But it's not like that anymore,
		그래, 더이상 그런
		사이는 아니니까
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:12	so now we can be friends and just hang.
		이제 친구로서
		같이 어울리는 거야
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	Tell me something, was it the drugs?
		말 좀 해줘
		마약 때문이었어?
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:17	Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?
		마약 때문에
		나랑 같이 잔 거였어?
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:19	Screw you.
		그 소린 집어치워
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:21	No, if there's another reason,
		아니, 다른 이유가 있다면
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:22	Please, I'm all ears.
		열심히 귀기울여 들어줄게
00:04:24	 
		 
00:04:30	Good morning, Elena.
		굿모닝, 엘레나
00:04:32

00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:42	She doesn't like me very much.
		날 별로 안 좋아하는 구나
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	She doesn't know you.
		널 몰라서 그래
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:47	She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me.
		내 단짝이잖아
		내 염려를 하는것 뿐야
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	But when she does,
		하지만 널 알게 되면

00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	So why don't you try out for the team?
		그럼 풋볼팀에
		지원해보는 건 어때?
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	Yeah, I don't think so.
		글쎄 별로
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	So you don't like football?

00:06:13	I don't think football likes me.
		풋볼이 날 좋아하는 거
		같지 않아서
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	You saw Tyler over there,

00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	To them, you're mysterious loner guy.
		넌 혼자서 다니는
		미스터리한 아이니까
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:24	Wouldn't hurt to be part of.

00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	Hey, come on. There's more to me than just
		왜 이래
		우울한 묘지속의 소녀보다
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:33	gloomy graveyard girl.
		더 많은 면이 있다고
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	There's a whole other Elena that you have yet to meet.

00:07:59	It was '53.
		53년에 끝났습니다
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:05	Look it up, somebody.
		어디 찾아보게
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	Quickly.
		빨리
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	It was 19...53.
		19..53년이 맞네요
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:23	How did you know all of that?
		어떻게 그걸 다 알아?
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	Years and years of crossword puzzles.
		크로스워드 퍼즐을
		오래하다 보니
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	It's a loner thing.
		혼자 놀다보니
		취미가 생겨서
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:36	Nice job! Nice job!
		잘했어
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	Mr. Lockwood, is there anything you're good at?
		락우드 군
		자네가 잘하는게 대체 뭔가?
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	'cause it isn't history,
		역사 공부도 못하고
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:42	and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!
		망할 수비도 못하고 있으니!
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	Yes, coach.
		네, 코치님
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	Now do it again!
		다시 하거라!
00:08:46	 
		 
00:09:10	Oh, my god! You're here!
		세상에, 네가 왔네
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:13	Yep. I can't be sad girl forever.
		응. 난 언제까지
		슬픈 소녀가 될순 없잖아
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	The only way to get things back to the way they were
		예전으로 돌아갈 유일한 방법은
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	are to do things that were.
		예전처럼 하는 거지
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight.
		오늘 저녁 우리집에서 먹자
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	I am? Mm-hmm.
		그래?
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	You and me and Stefan.
		너랑 나랑 스테판 셋이서
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	You have to give him a chance.
		기회를 줘봐
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Tonight's no good.
		오늘밤은 안되겠어
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:28	Have you seen Caroline?
		캐롤라인 못 봤니?
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	I texted her like a hundred times.
		문자 몇백번 보냈는데
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett.
		주제 바꾸지 마
		보니 베넷
00:09:34	 
		 
00:09:34	You're going to be there.
		넌 꼭 와야해
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	Fine. I'll go.
		알았어, 갈게
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	Good.
		좋아
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore.
		대표팀 선발은
		지난 봄에 끝냈다네
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	I wasn't here then, sir.
		그 때는 다른 학교에 있었습니다만
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.
		지금도 나한테는
		없는거나 다름없어
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:46	Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I
		코치님, 시작이
		좋지 않았던 거 알아요
00:09:48	 
		코치님, 시작이
		좋지 않았던 거 알아요
00:09:48	didn't get off to the best start,
		코치님, 시작이
		좋지 않았던 거 알아요
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	and I want to apologize for that.
		그래서 사과하고 싶습니다
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	I've played football before.
		예전에 풋볼을 했었어요
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.
		와이드 리시버로요
		꽤 잘합니다
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:58	Well, I won't be asking you who won the super bowl in '71.
		71년도에 수퍼볼을
		우승한 팀을 묻진 않겠네
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	'71 was the...
		71년도는..
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	Sorry. I... I understand that, sir.
		죄송합니다
		이해해요
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	Just to see you get knocked on your ass.
		네가 다른 선수들한테
		혼쭐 당하는 걸 보고 싶구나
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	Borrow some gear.
		유니폼 빌려 오거라
00:10:13	 
		 
00:10:13	Go!
		어서!
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!
		마음 바뀌기 전에
		다시 돌아!
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:18	First my girlfriend, now the team?
		내 여자친구도 뺏더니
		이젠 팀까지?
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:22	Dude, this is an opportunity.
		이건 기회야
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	Football's a contact sport.
		풋볼은 부딪히며 하는
		스포츠잖아
00:10:26	 
		 
00:10:26	Sometimes people get hurt.
		사람이 다치기도 하지
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	Whoo!
		 
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	Ha ha!
		 
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	Seriously, where is Caroline?
		진짜 캐롤라인 어디있는 거지?
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	I don't know. It's not like her.
		모르겠어
		걔 답지 않네
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	Try her again.
		다시 해봐
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:42	Uh...
		어..
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	Oh, my god.
		세상에
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:47	That must be the mystery guy from the Grill.
		카페에서 봤다던
		그 미스터리한 남자가 틀림없어
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	That's not a mystery guy.
		미스터리한 남자 아닌데
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	That's Damon Salvatore.
		데이먼 살바토어야
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	Salvatore, as in stefan?
		살바토어라면
		스테판 형?
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:59	I got the other brother.
		대신에 형을 낚았지
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	Hope you don't mind.
		괜찮길 바래
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:02	Sorry I'm late, girls.
		미안해 늦어서
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	I, uh, was busy.
		내가.. 좀 바빴어
00:11:05	 
		 
00:11:06	All right, let's start with the double pike herkey hurdler,
		좋아, 이제 시작하자
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	What do you say?
		어때?
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:15	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
		하나 둘 셋 넷
		다섯 여섯 일곱 여덟
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:18	1, 2, 3, 4,
		하나 둘 셋 넷

00:11:24	5, 6, 7, 8.
		다섯 여섯 일곱 여덟
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today?
		엘레나, 오늘은 그냥
		앉아서 보는게 어때?
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	Ok?
		 
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top.
		계속해!

00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	7, 8.
		 
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	Blue lady!
		 
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	Blue lady!
		 
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	Set, hut! Go!
		 
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:53	Come on, Tyler, cover it!
		타일러, 막으란 말야!
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:58	Let's do it.
		 
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Get it.
		잡아
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:03	Line up!
		일렬로 정렬!
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:16	* King and sons of god *
		 
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	* Traveled on their way *
		 
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	* from here *
		 
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:29	* Calming restless mobs *
		 
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:33	* Easing all of their *
		 
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	* all of their fear *
		 
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:40	* Strange times *
		 
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	* are here *
		 
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	* Strange times *
		 
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	* are here *
		 
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:56	I hate to say it, but he's got skills.
		인정하긴 싫지만
		실력 좋네
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	I think he needs a buddy pass.
		공격해서 쓰러뜨려
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	Really?
		진짜?
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	You don't get to walk on the field
		처음 출전을 해서
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	and act like you own the place after 5 minutes.
		5분간 자기 운동장인냥
		행세할 순 없는거야
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	Just hang one up there and I'll take care of the rest.
		내가 나머지는 처리할게
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	Do it again.
		다시 하거라!
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	All right, let's huddle up.
		선수들 집합
00:13:12	 
		 
00:13:12	Set, hut!
		출발!
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:19	Oh!
		 
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:22	Whoo!
		 
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	Welcome to the team, buddy.
		팀에 들어온 걸 환영해
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	Let's go.
		어서 가자
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	You gonna live, Salvatore?
		정신 차릴수 있겠나?
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	Yeah.
		네
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	Walk it off, son.
		이제 들어가게
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:35	Hey. That was my bad.
		아깐 꽤 심했지
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:38	It's all right.
		괜찮아
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	Hey.
		 
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	All right.
		좋아
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:59	How were tryouts?
		선발은 어떻게 됐어?
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	Did you make the team?
		팀에 뽑혔니?
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	Very Emerson, the way you reveal your soul with so many...
		참 작가 '에멀슨' 같으시네
		일기장에 네 감정을..
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	adjectives.
		형용사로 꾸며대시는게
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:12	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐해?
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:16	I've come to apologize.
		사과하려고
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	I've been doing some thinking,
		생각도 해보고
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:20	some soul searching, and...
		영혼의 탐색도 했어
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	I want us to start over.
		우리 다시 시작했으면 좋겠다
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	We need to put the past behind us.
		우린 과거를 제쳐둬야 해
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	You're my little brother,
		넌 내 동생이야
00:14:31	 
		 
00:14:31	and if you want to live
		네가 만약에
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	a normal, happy human life,
		평범하고 행복한
		인간의 삶을 살고 싶다면
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	then I want that for you.
		난 그걸 바래
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	Maybe I can do it, too.
		그래줄 수도 있어
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	That I can learn to be a non-living
		그럼 나는 살아있지 않은
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	living person.
		산 사람이 될 수 있겠지
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	Maybe there's hope for both of us.
		어쩌면 우리 둘에게 희망이 있을거야
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:58	You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.
		이럴 필요는 없어, 데이먼
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:02	Of course it doesn't.
		물론 그렇지
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:04	I saw Elena today, BTW.
		BTW 오늘 엘레나를 봤어
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:07	That means "by the way."
		BTW 는 어쨌든의 줄임말이야
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:08	She was at cheerleading practice.
		치어리딩 연습하고 있더라
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	She looked so perky in her little short shorts.
		아주 짧은 바지를 입고
		의기 양양해 보이던데
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	Just...
		그냥..
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:17	Simmer down, I didn't even go near her.
		진정해, 근처도 안갔어
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	I've got my own cheerleader now.
		나만의 치어리더가 있는걸
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	Oh, that reminds me...
		그래서 생각나는데..
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	I gotta run. I have a date.
		가봐야 겠다. 데이트가 있어
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	Sweaty palms.
		손바닥에 땀이 다 나네
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	Wish me luck.
		행운을 빌어줘
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:34	You explain it.
		설명해 봐
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:35	Last night, I'm watching nine-o,
		어젯밤에 TV를 보다가
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:37	a commercial breaks come on and I'm like,
		중간광고가 나와서
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough,
		전화기 광고겠다
		생각했는데 정말로
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	it's that guy and the girl with the bench,
		그 남자랑 여자가
		벤치에 앉아있는데
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:43	he flies to Paris and he flies back.
		남자가 파리로 날라갔다
		돌아오는 광고였어
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	- They take a picture. - Oh, come on.
		- 그리고 사진을 찍지
		- 왜 이래
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	That commercial's on a constant loop.
		그 CF는 요즘 계속 나와
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	Fine.
		좋아
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Well, how about this?
		이건 어때?
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	Today I'm obsessed with numbers.
		요즘에 난 숫자에 집착하고 있어
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22.
		세가지 숫자
		8과 14와 22
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:57	How weird is that?
		정말 이상하지?
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	Maybe we should play the lottery.
		로또해보는 게 어때
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:03	Have you talked to your Grams?
		할머니랑 얘기해봤어?
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:05	She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch.
		그건 내가 마녀라
		그렇다고 하셔
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?
		난 마녀되기 싫은데
		너는 좋니?
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	I don't want to be a witch.
		나도 마녀되기 싫어
00:16:11	 
		 
00:16:11	And putting it in a nice bowl
		예쁜 그릇에 담는다고
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	isn't fooling anybody.
		속아 넘어가지 않아
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	Ok, serving spoons.
		맞아 숫가락
00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:16	Where are the serving spoons?
		어디 갔지?
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	Little drawer on your left.
		왼쪽 작은 서랍
00:16:19	 
		 
00:16:28	Ok, so you've been in this kitchen like a thousand times.
		뭐 넌 우리 집 부엌을
		몇백번이고 들락날락했으니
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	Yeah, that's it. 
		그래 그것 때문이야
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	Ok, he's here.
		왔다
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self.
		긴장하지 마
		원래 사랑스러운 모습을 보여
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:45	Birthday candles.
		생일 초
00:16:47	 
		 
00:17:03	Did tanner give you a hard time today?
		태너 선생님이 오늘 심하게 했니?
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:07	Well, he let me on the team,
		팀에 들어가게 해주셨어
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	So I must have done something right.
		내가 선생님한테 잘 보였나봐
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:11	Bonnie, you should have seen stefan today.
		보니, 너도 오늘
		스테판을 봤어야 하는데
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	Tyler threw a ball right at him, and...
		타일러가 공을 던졌는데..
00:17:14	 
		 
00:17:14	Yeah, I heard.
		알아, 들었어
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:22	Why don't you tell stefan about your family?
		스테판한테 너희 가족
		얘기하는 거 어때?
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad.
		이혼 하셨어. 엄마 없이
		아빠랑 같이 살아
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	Hmm.
		 
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	No, about the witches.
		아니, 마녀 얘기 말야
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches.
		보니 조상중에
		마녀였던 분이 계셨대
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	It's really cool.
		쿨하다
00:17:36	 
		 
00:17:36	Cool isn't the word I'd use.
		나라면 쿨하단 얘긴 안할거야
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:40	Well, it's certainly interesting.
		그래도 참 흥미롭잖아
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	I'm not too versed,
		나는 조예가 깊지 않지만
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:43	but I do know that there's
		이 마을에 1800년 대에 이주했던
00:17:44	 
		이 마을에 1800년 대에 이주했던
00:17:44	a history of Celtic Druids
		이 마을에 1800년 대에 이주했던
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	that migrated here in the 1800s.
		켈트의 마법사가 있었대
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:48	My family came by way of salem.
		우리 가족은
		세일럼 출신이야
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	Really?
		정말?
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:52	Salem witches?
		세일럼의 마녀?
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	Yeah. 
		응
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:56	I would say that's pretty cool.
		멋지다
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:58	Really? Why?
		정말? 왜?
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Salem witches are heroic examples
		세일럼의 마녀들은 개인주의와
		비국교도의 영웅적 본보기거든
00:18:02	 
		세일럼의 마녀들은 개인주의와
		비국교도의 영웅적 본보기거든
00:18:02	of individualism
		세일럼의 마녀들은 개인주의와
		비국교도의 영웅적 본보기거든
00:18:05	 
		세일럼의 마녀들은 개인주의와
		비국교도의 영웅적 본보기거든
00:18:05	and nonconformity.
		세일럼의 마녀들은 개인주의와
		비국교도의 영웅적 본보기거든
00:18:07	 
		세일럼의 마녀들은 개인주의와
		비국교도의 영웅적 본보기거든
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:08	Yeah, they are.
		그렇지
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:14	I wonder who that could be.
		 
00:18:15	I wonder who that could be.
		누군지 궁금하다
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:20	Surprise!
		놀랐지!
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	Bonnie said you were doing dinner,
		보니가 둘이 저녁 먹는대서
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	so we brought dessert.
		디저트 가져왔어
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	- Oh. - Hope you don't mind.
		방해 안되길 바래요
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:29	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐해?
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:31	Waiting for Elena to invite me in.
		엘레나가 초대하기만을
		기다리고 있지
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:33	- Oh, yeah, you can... - No, no, no.
		- 그래, 형은..
		- 아니 아니
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:35	He can't, uh...
		형은..
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	He can't stay.
		머무를 수 없어
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:40	Can you, damon?
		그렇지?
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:43	Get in here.
		들어와요
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	We're just... finishing up.
		우린.. 거의 끝냈는데
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	It's fine. Just come on in.
		괜찮아, 그냥 들어오세요
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:59	You have a beautiful home, Elena.
		집이 참 예쁘네요, 엘레나
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	Thank you. 
		고마워요
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:09	I just cann't believe Mr. Tanner let you in the team.
		코치님이 널 풋볼팀
		선수로 뽑았다니
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	Tanner must be sealing.
		예의상 뽑아준 걸거야
00:19:14	But good for you. Go for it.
		암튼 잘됐다
00:19:14	But good for you. Go for it.
		 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	That's what I always tell him. You have to engage.
		내가 늘 동생한테 그랬죠
		참여를 해야 된다고
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	You can't just sit there and wait for life to come to you.
		앉아서 인생이 널
		찾아오기만을 기다리는게 아니라
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	You have to go get it.
		가서 쟁취하라고
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today.
		엘레나는 별로 운이 없었죠
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	It's only because you missed summer camp.
		네가 여름캠프를
		놓쳐서 그렇게 된거야
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	God, I don't know how you're ever going to learn the routines.
		네가 다시 댄스 루틴을
		다 익힐수나 있을지 모르겠다
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	I'll work with her. She'll get it.
		내가 도와줄거야
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	I guess we can put her in the back.
		뒤에 배치해야 겠어
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	You know, you don't seem like
		엘레나는 별로 치어리더
		타입 같지 않던데
00:19:33	 
		엘레나는 별로 치어리더
		타입 같지 않던데
00:19:33	the cheerleader type, Elena.
		엘레나는 별로 치어리더
		타입 같지 않던데
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died.
		부모님이 돌아가셔서 그래요
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	Yeah, I mean, she's just
		네 그러니까
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	totally going through a blah phase.
		정말 암울한 단계를
		겪어냈어요
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	She used to be way more fun.
		정말 재미있는 아이였는데
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	And I say that with complete sensitivity.
		동정심에서 말하는거에요
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:48	I'm sorry, Elena.
		미안해요, 엘레나
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	I know what it's like to lose both your parents.
		부모님 두분 모두
		잃는게 어떤지 알아요
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	In fact, Stefan and I have watched almost every single person
		스테판하고 난
		우리가 아끼던 사람이
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	we've ever cared about die.
		다들 죽는걸 봤거든요
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	We don't need to get into that right now, Damon.
		그 얘긴 꺼낼 필요 없잖아
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Oh, you know what, you're right, stef. I'm sorry.
		있지, 네 말이 맞다
		미안하구나
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up.
		난 전혀 그녀 얘길
		꺼내고 싶지 않거든요
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:09	Mmm.
		 
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	Don't do that.
		그러지 마
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	Not while I'm working.
		일하는 중에는
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:17	I'll see you later.
		나중에 봐
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	I'll be right back.
		 
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:28	She's my sister and I love her,
		비키는 내 여동생이고
		난 동생을 사랑해
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:31	but sometimes she can really make you work for it.
		하지만 가끔 그러기
		힘들때가 있어
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:34	I find it pretty easy.
		난 늘 사랑스럽던데
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:45	All right, I get it. Hitting me to impress her. That's...
		알겠어. 비키한테
		잘보이려고 날 친거
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:48	that's real nice.
		참 대단하신데
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	I don't need to impress her.
		잘보일 필요 없어
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	I already won.
		이미 마음을 얻었는걸
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:55	- Now you're dead. - Am I? 'cause it seems like
		- 이제 죽은 줄 알아
		- 그래? 내가 보기엔
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.
		네가 남자답게 나오기만을
		오랫동안 기다렸거든
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	Ty, don't!
		타이, 그만둬!
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	The next time I see you, Gilbert...
		다음에 널 보면..
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	No, next time I see you.
		아니, 네가 죽을 줄 알아
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:11	What are you doin', Vick?
		뭐 하는거야, 비키?
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:15	One more.
		한 개 더
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:16	Oh, thank you. 
		고마워요
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:21	Nice save.
		잘 받으시네요
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:24	I like you.
		난 그쪽이 맘에 들어요
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:26	You know how to laugh.
		웃게 만드는 법을 알죠
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	And you make stefan smile,
		스테판을 미소짓게 하잖아요
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	which is something I haven't seen
		걔가 웃는 건
		정말 오랜만이에요
00:21:30	 
		걔가 웃는 건
		정말 오랜만이에요
00:21:30	in a very long time.
		걔가 웃는 건
		정말 오랜만이에요
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:35	Earlier, did you mean... Katherine?
		좀 전에 하신 말씀
		캐더린 얘긴가요?
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	Mm-hmm.
		네
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	How did she die?
		어떻게 죽었죠?
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:43	In a fire. Tragic fire.
		화재였죠
		아주 비극적인 화재
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	Recently?
		최근에요?
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	Well, it seems like it was yesterday.
		어젯일 같네요
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:52	What was she like?
		어떻게 생겼어요?
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:56	She was beautiful.
		아름다웠죠
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:58	A lot like you in that department.
		그쪽같이 예뻤어요
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	She was just very complicated
		하지만 참 복잡하고
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	and selfish and at times not very kind,
		이기적이고 가끔씩은
		불량하지만
00:22:05	 
		 
00:22:05	but very sexy and seductive.
		섹시하고 매혹적이었죠
00:22:06	 
		 
00:22:06	So which one of you dated her first?
		그럼 누가 먼저
		그녀와 사귀었죠?
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:14	Nicely deduced.
		멋진 추리인데요
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	Ask stefan.
		스테판한테 물어봐요
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	I'm sure his answer differs from mine.
		내 답변이랑 다를걸요
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:30	I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.
		나라면 치어리더 그만뒀을거에요
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	Why do you say that?
		왜요?
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable.
		연습 때 봤는데
		참 서툴러 보이던데요
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	You saw that?
		봤어요?
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	Uh-huh.
		네
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:40	I used to love it. It was fun.
		예전엔 좋아했어요. 재미있고
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:43	Things are different this year.
		올해엔 달라졌어요
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:45	Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.
		모든게 더이상
		중요치 않아졌어요
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:47	So don't let it.
		그럼 바꿔요
00:22:48	 
		 
00:22:48	Quit, move on. Problem solved.
		그만 두고, 새시작하고
		그럼 문제 해결
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	Ta-da.
		짜잔
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:52	Some things could matter again.
		다시 좋아질지 몰라요
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	Maybe.
		어쩌면요
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	But... seems a little unrealistic to me.
		하지만.. 나한텐
		비현실적으로 보이는걸요
00:23:00	 
		 
00:23:05	I'm sorry.
		미안해요
00:23:07	 
		 
00:23:09	About Katherine.
		캐더린 말인데요
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:13	You lost her, too.
		당신도 그녀를 잃으셨죠
00:23:14	 
		 
00:23:19	Hey.
		엘레나
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:21	Need some help?
		뭐 도와줄까?
00:23:23	 
		 
00:23:23	Sure, why not?
		물론이죠
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:25	Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time.
		맷은 노력을 하는데
		정말 힘들어 해
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:28	You have to understand that
		둘은 서로 처음으로
		사귀었던 사이란걸 이해해줘
00:23:29	 
		둘은 서로 처음으로
		사귀었던 사이란걸 이해해줘
00:23:30	they were each other's first.
		둘은 서로 처음으로
		사귀었던 사이란걸 이해해줘
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	You know, like, from the sandbox.
		모래놀이 할 때 부터 말야
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:38	That's a really nice scarf.
		스카프 멋지다
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:40	Mm. Thank you, it's new.
		고마워. 새거야
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:42	Can I see it?
		봐도 될까?
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	I mean, would you mind taking it off?
		벗어도 되니?
00:23:45	 
		 
00:23:46	Oh, I can't.
		안 돼
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:48	Why not? You Ok?
		왜? 괜찮아?
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:52	Um...
		 
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:53	All I know is that I can't take it off.
		벗으면 안된다고 했거든
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:56	What are you two kids talking about?
		둘이 무슨 얘기를 하지?
00:23:59	 
		 
00:24:00	I was just commenting on her scarf.
		스카프에 대해서
		얘기하고 있었어
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:01	Hmm. Hey, you know, um,
		있지
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes.
		엘레나랑 보니는
		설거지 마무리 중인데
00:24:06	 
		 
00:24:06	Why don't you go see if you can help?
		도와줄거 없나 가볼래?
00:24:06	 
		 
00:24:08	Does it look like I do dishes?
		내가 설거지 하는 사람으로 보여?
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:12	For me?
		날 위해서?
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:13	Hmm... I don't think so.
		글쎄.. 별로
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:20	Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.
		부엌에 도울일 없나
		가서 봐라
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:24	You know what?
		있지?
00:24:24	 
		 
00:24:25	I'm gonna go see if Elena needs some help in the kitchen.
		엘레나가 부엌에서
		뭐하나 보러 가볼게
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:28	Great.
		좋아
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:39	They are people, Damon.
		그녀는 인간이야, 데이먼
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:40	She's not a puppet.
		꼭두각시가 아니라고
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:42	She doesn't exist for your amusement,
		형의 재미를 위해서
		존재하지 않는다고
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	for you to feed on whenever you want to.
		원하면 언제든
		피를 빨라고 있지도 않고
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	Sure she does.
		물론 날 위해 존재하지
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:47	They all do.
		인간은 모두 그런걸
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:48	They're whatever I want them to be.
		내가 원하는 뭐든 되주지
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:49	They're mine for the taking.
		이용하라고 있는거야
00:24:50	 
		 
00:24:51	All right, you've had your fun.
		형은 이제 재미를 봤어
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:52	You used Caroline, you got to me and Elena,
		캐롤라인을 이용해서
		나와 엘레나에게 접근했고
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:54	Good for you.
		잘했어
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:55	Now it's time for you to go.
		이제 가줄 시간이야
00:24:56	 
		 
00:24:57	That's not a problem.
		문제 없어
00:24:59	 
		 
00:25:00	Because...
		왜냐면..
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:02	I've been invited in,
		엘레나한테 초대를 받았으니
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:04	And I'll come back tomorrow night
		내일밤에도 돌아오고
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	and the following night
		그 다음 날에도 돌아올거야
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	and I'll do with your little cheerleader
		네 가엾은 치어리더와
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:10	whatever I want to do.
		내가 원하는 뭐든지 해볼거야
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:12	Because that is what is normal to me.
		그게 나한텐
		정상적인 일이거든
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:23	Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.
		오늘 저녁 나쁘진 않았어
		재미있었어
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:25	Hmm. That makes one of us.
		나도
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:26	Come on.
		왜 이래
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:28	Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...
		네 형은 네 생각만큼..
00:25:30	 
		 
00:26:58	there must be a shred of humanity left inside my brother.
		내 형에게도 마음 깊이
		인간애가 남아 있을것이다
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	Somewhere.
		마음 속 어딘가엔
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	I keep hoping.
		그렇게 계속 희망을 했다
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	But how do I make him see it?
		하지만 어떻게 하면
		볼 수 있을까?
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	And how do I protect her?
		어떻게 그녀를 보호할 수 있을까?
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:47	Ooh.
		 
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.
		너 좀 봐
		운동복 입으니 섹시하네
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	What happened? No more cheerleader?
		무슨 일이야
		치어리더 안해?
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	I quit. I'm a quitter.
		그만 뒀어
		난 그만두기 대장이야
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:54	No, hey, you're not a quitter.
		넌 그만두기 대장 아냐
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:57	You suffered a great loss. You're not the same person.
		큰 사건을 겪어서
		달라진 것 뿐야
00:27:59	 
		 
00:27:59	You should be looking ahead.
		넌 더 넓게 봐야해
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	You should be starting over.
		다시 시작하는 거야
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	Ok?
		알았지?
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:07	I hope you don't think this is
		나는 네가
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	too soon or too weird, but...
		너무 빠르거나 이상하게
		생각하길 바라지 않지만
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	I, uh,
		난...
00:28:14	 
		 
00:28:14	I wanted you to have this.
		이걸 가지길 바래
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:22	Oh, my god, it's beautiful.
		세상에, 아름답다
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	It's something that I've had forever,
		내가 오랫동안
		간직하던 거야
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	and, uh, I've never wanted to give it to anyone until now.
		여태까지 누구한테
		주고싶은 마음이 없었어
00:28:29	 
		 
00:28:29	I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me,
		네가 날 위해 차고 다니면
		정말 좋을거야
00:28:34	 
		 
00:28:34	For... good luck.
		행운을.. 위해서
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:38	Is that rose that I smell?
		장미향이야?
00:28:39	 
		 
00:28:39	No, it's, uh... it's an herb.
		아니, 허브야
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:43	It's nice, huh?
		괜찮지?
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	I love it.
		맘에 들어
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:48	And, uh,
		그리고
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:49	I wanted to thank you
		고맙다고 하고 싶어
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:52	for pushing me to try out for the team.
		팀에 도전해보라고 권유해줘서
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	It feels really good.
		정말 기분이 좋아
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:58	We're a pair.
		우린 한 짝이야
00:28:59	 
		 
00:28:59	I quit, you start.
		내가 그만두니
		넌 시작을 했지
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:01	Right. 
		그래
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	We're a work in progress.
		우린 진행되는 일이야
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:05	We'll figure it out.
		잘 해내게 될거야
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:20	And you're not in uniform because...
		유니폼 안 입은 이유는..
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:49	Wait, wait, wait,
		잠시만
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:52	wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
		진정해 주십시요
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	Wait. Let's be honest here.
		솔직해집시다
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	In the past, we used to let other teams
		과거에 우리는 경기장에서
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:00	come into our town and roll right over us!
		다른 팀이 박살 내는걸
		바라보고만 있었습니다
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:05	But that is about to change.
		하지만 이젠 바뀔 것입니다
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:11	We've got some great new talent
		우리 팀은 오늘 저녁
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	tonight starting on the offensive line,
		공격라인에 신인 선수를
		배치했습니다
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:15	And I'm gonna tell you right now,
		바로 지금 알려드리죠
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	it has been a long time
		정말 오랫 만에
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	since I have seen a kid like this
		대단한 실력을 가진
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	with hands like these.
		선수를 발견했습니다
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:29	This blows.
		어이가 없네
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:30	He can't start the guy. He just got here.
		들어온지 얼마나 됐다고
		출전시키지
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:32	That have been waiting for us
		우리는 오랫동안
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	to put a check in the win column,
		우승명단에 들기만을
		기다려 왔습니다
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:36	I have only one thing to say to you...
		한가지 말씀드리죠
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:39	your timberwolves are hungry.
		팀버울프팀은 배가 고프답니다
00:30:41	 
		 
00:30:43	Hey, you. What's wrong?
		타일러, 무슨 일이야?
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	- Nothing. - And the central high lions
		- 암것도 아냐
		- 라이언스팀은
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	are what's for dinner!
		바로 우리 저녁밥이에요!
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	Is that Jeremy?
		쟤 제레미지?
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	Wait, no! Ty! No.
		잠깐만, 타이, 안돼!
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	Oh, what do you care?
		여긴 왜 왔어?
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	Don't look so down.
		우울해 하지마
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	You can have her when I'm done.
		내가 끝내고 나서
		가지면 되잖아
00:30:59	 
		 
00:31:03	Tyler, stop it!
		타일러, 그만 해!
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:07	Tyler! Tyler, stop!
		타일러, 멈춰!
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	Stop it!
		그만둬!
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	Stop, you're hurting him!
		다치겠잖아
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:12	Tyler!
		타일러!
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	Tyler, stop!
		멈춰!
00:31:15	 
		 
00:31:17	Tyler!
		타일러!
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	Stop it! Tyler, stop!
		그만해!
00:31:20	 
		 
00:31:20	Hey, he's down! Enough!
		쓰러졌잖아! 그만해!
00:31:23	 
		 
00:31:30	Jeremy, no!
		제레미, 안돼!
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:33	Get off me! Stop!
		저리 비켜
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	What the hell, Jeremy?
		대체 이게 뭐야, 제레미!
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	Put your head up, you're bleeding.
		고개 들어봐
		피가 나잖아
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:41	I'm fine!
		난 괜찮다구!
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	Yeah, you smell fine.
		냄새가 아주 정상이신데
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	Just stop, ok?
		그만하라고
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:47	Come on, man. Come on.
		진정 해
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	Oh, my god, your hand.
		손 좀 봐
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	No, no, no, it's fine.
		아니, 괜찮아
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	Is it deep? How bad is it?
		얼마나 많이 베인거야?
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:53	Come on!
		어서
00:31:55	 
		 
00:31:59	But... I saw it, it was...
		난 봤단 말야, 그건...
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	He missed.
		빗나갔어
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	It's not my blood.
		내가 흘린 피가 아녔어
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	- See? I'm fine. - No, no, no.
		- 봤지? 괜찮아
		- 아니 아니
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	I... I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was...
		봤다고. 유리병이
		네 손을 스쳤는데..
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	It's ok. I'm ok.
		괜찮아
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	It's almost kick-off time, all right?
		킥오프 시즌이지?
00:32:12	 
		 
00:32:12	So, um,
		그러니까
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:14	I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game.
		경기 끝나고 봐
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:25	Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly.
		티키, 흔들리잖아
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:27	Can you stand straight, please?
		좀 똑바로 세울래?
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:29	Could someone please help Tiki?
		티키 좀 도와줄 사람?
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	Hey! Where you been?
		어디 갔었어?
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:32	Can I ask you a question
		질문을 하나 할게
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:33	and you give me a really serious no-joke response?
		농담말고 진지하게
		대답하겠다 약속해줄래?
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	Of course. What is it?
		물론이야. 뭔데?
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	The bad mojo.
		안좋다는 예감
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	When you touched Stefan and you had that reaction...
		스테판 손을 스칠때
		반응이 있었다며..
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	You know what, forget I said that.
		있지, 그 말 잊어버려
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:43	Your little dinner party plot totally won me over.
		저녁파티때 마음이 바뀌었어
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:45	No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it?
		아니, 보니
		정말. 그게 뭐였어?
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	Did you see something,
		뭘 봤니?
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:48	or...
		아님..
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:51	it wasn't clear like a picture.
		사진처럼 선명하진 않았어
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	Like today, I keep seeing
		오늘처럼
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	those same numbers I told you about...
		내가 너한테 말한
		숫자들 있지
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:56	8, 14, 22.
		8, 14, 22
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	- Yeah? - When I touched Stefan,
		- 응?
		- 스테판을 만질때
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	it was a feeling.
		느낌이 왔어
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	And it vibrated through me, and it was cold, and it...
		온 몸을 떨게 했어
		차가웠고..
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	and what?
		그리고 뭐?
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	It was death.
		죽음이 느껴졌어
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	It's what I imagine death to be like.
		내가 상상했던 죽음과 같았어
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:27	You scared me. What are you doing here?
		놀랐잖아요
		여기서 뭐해요?
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:30	I'm hiding from Caroline.
		캐롤라인을 피해 숨은 거에요
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:32	And why is that?
		왜요?
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:34	I needed a break.
		숨돌릴 틈이 필요했어요
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:36	She talks more than I can listen.
		정말 말이 많아요
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	That could be a sign.
		좀 그렇죠
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	Well, she's awfully young.
		너무 어리기도 하고
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:41	Not much younger than you are.
		그쪽보다 그리 어리진 않은데
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:45	I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture.
		더 크게 발전할 가망성은
		없어보여요
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:47	I think she'd drive me crazy.
		날 미치게 만들거든요
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	Caroline does have
		캐롤라인은 좀
		짜증나게 만드는 구석이 있는데
00:33:51	 
		캐롤라인은 좀
		짜증나게 만드는 구석이 있는데
00:33:51	some really annoying traits,
		캐롤라인은 좀
		짜증나게 만드는 구석이 있는데
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	but we've been friends since the first grade
		우리는 1학년 때 부터 친구였고
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	and that means something to me.
		그래서 특별해요
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:56	Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable.
		알겠어요. 불편하게
		했다면 미안해요
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:59	That's not my intention.
		그런 의도가 아녔는데
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	Yes, it is.
		맞는걸요
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	Otherwise you wouldn't put an alternate meaning
		아니라면 그쪽이 했던 말에
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	behind everything you say.
		속뜻이 숨어있진 않았겠죠
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:10	You're right.
		맞아요
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	I do have other intentions, but so do you.
		난 다른 의도가 있어요
		그쪽도 마찬가지구요
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:16	Really? Mm-hmm.
		정말요? / 네
00:34:18	 
		 
00:34:18	I see 'em.
		보여요
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	You want me.
		날 원하죠
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	Excuse me?
		뭐라고요?
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me.
		내가 당신에게 다가가면
		나한테 끌리는 걸 발견하죠
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:26	You think about me even when you don't want to think about me.
		내 생각하기 싫을 때도
		내 생각을 하고
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	I bet you even dreamed about me.
		내 꿈도 꿨을걸요
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:32	And right now...
		바로 지금...
00:34:33	 
		 
00:34:33	you want to kiss me.
		나한테 키스하고 싶죠
00:34:36	 
		 
00:34:43	What the hell?
		당신 도대체 뭐야?
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	I don't know what game you're trying to play with Stefan here,
		스테판한테 어떤 게임을
		하려는 건지 몰라도
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	but I don't want to be part of it.
		난 그 일부가 되고 싶지 않아요
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	And I don't know what happened in the past,
		과거에 무슨 일이
		있었는지 모르지만
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	but let's get one thing straight...
		한가지는 확실히 하고 가죠
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:53	I am not Katherine.
		난 캐더린이 아녜요
00:34:56	 
		 
00:35:04	You gonna be able to play?
		계속 뛸 수 있겠어?
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:05	Oh, yeah, I'm good.
		응, 괜찮아
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:08	Uh, what you did back there...
		아까 거기서..
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:11	you had Jeremy's back.
		제레미 편들어 줬잖아
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	Ah, he's a messed-up kid.
		망가진 아이야
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	Somebody's gotta look out for him.
		주의깊게 살펴줄 사람이 필요해
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	I know.
		알아
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	This week at practice I was a dick.
		이번 주 훈련 때
		내가 좀 밥맛 없었지
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	Had your reasons.
		이유가 있었겠지
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	No excuse.
		핑계 안댈게
00:35:25	 
		 
00:35:29	Good luck tonight.
		오늘밤 행운을 빌어
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	We're lucky to have you.
		네가 우리팀에 들어온건 행운이야
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:40	Isn't that nice?
		눈물겹군
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	Stefan joins a team, makes a friend.
		스테판이 팀에 합류하고
		친구를 만들다
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	It's all so, "rah, rah, go team, yeah!"
		'우리 팀 화이팅!'할 만하네
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	Not tonight.
		오늘은 그만해
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:50	I'm done with you.
		형과는 끝났어
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:53	Nice trick with Elena.
		엘레나한테 준 거
		참 좋은 책략이었어
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	Let me guess... vervain in the necklace?
		어디 맞춰보자
		목걸이에 마편초를 넣은거야?
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	I admit, I was a bit surprised.
		인정할게. 좀 놀랐어
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	It's been a while since anyone could resist my compulsion.
		내 주문이 안 통하는
		사람은 오랫만이거든
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:04	Where'd you get it?
		어디서 구했어?
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:06	Does it matter?
		그게 중요해?
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	Guess I could just seduce her the old-fashioned way.
		구식의 방법으로
		그녀를 유혹할수도 있어
00:36:09	 
		 
00:36:09	Or I could just... eat her.
		아니면.. 그냥 먹어버리던가
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:16	No.
		아니
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.
		형은 엘레나를
		다치게 하지 않을거야
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:20	No?
		그래?
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:21	Because deep down inside,
		마음 깊숙히
00:36:23	 
		 
00:36:23	there is a part of you
		형에게도
		그녀를 불쌍히 여기는
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	that feels for her.
		마음이 있을거야
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:26	I was worried that you had no humanity
		나는 형 마음속에
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	left inside of you,
		인간애가 남아있지
		않을까봐 걱정했었어
00:36:31	 
		 
00:36:31	That you may have actually become the monster
		연기해왔던 그 괴물이
		실제로 될까봐 걱정했다구
00:36:34	 
		연기해왔던 그 괴물이
		실제로 될까봐 걱정했다구
00:36:34	that you pretend to be.
		연기해왔던 그 괴물이
		실제로 될까봐 걱정했다구
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	- Who's pretending? - Then kill me.
		- 누가 연기를 한다고?
		- 그리고 날 죽일까봐
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:38	Well, I'm... I'm tempted.
		솔깃하긴 하지
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	No, you're not.
		아니, 아니야
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	You've had lifetimes to do it,
		정말 많은 세월동안
		기회가 있었지만
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:44	and yet, here I am. I'm still alive.
		난 아직까지 여기 살아있어
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	And there you are.
		그리고 형도 여기서
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:48	You're still haunting me.
		여전히 내 곁에
		귀신처럼 맴돌지
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:51	After 145 years.
		145년이 지났는데
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:54	Katherine is dead.
		캐더린은 죽었어
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:58	And you hate me
		그녀를 사랑해서
		날 미워하는 거지
00:36:59	 
		그녀를 사랑해서
		날 미워하는 거지
00:36:59	because you loved her,
		그녀를 사랑해서
		날 미워하는 거지
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	and you torture me because you still do.
		아직도 캐더린을 사랑해서
		나한테 고문을 하는거야
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:05	And that, my brother,
		그래서 그게
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:09	is your humanity.
		바로 형의 인간다운 모습이야
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:12	Salvatore!
		살바토어군!
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:15	What the hell? We've got a game to play!
		대체 뭐야?
		경기가 남아있는데!
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	If that's my humanity...
		그게 내 인간다운 모습이라면..
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	then what's this?
		이건 뭘까?
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:25	- Aah! - No!
		안돼!
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:33	Anyone, anytime, any place.
		누구든, 언제든, 어디서든
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:40	Tanner's m.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.
		코치님이 실종됐대
		술을 많이 마셨나봐
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:43	Don't talk to me right now, all right? I'm pissed at you.
		말하지 마
		응? 너 때문에 열받았어
00:37:44	 
		 
00:37:44	What's your problem? What's my...
		뭐가 문제야?
00:37:46	 
		 
00:37:46	You're my problem, all right?
		네가 내 문제야, 알았냐?
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:47	You're a bully.
		애들을 괴롭히잖아
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man.
		12살짜리 골목대장 같이 군다고
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	And I'm sick of it.
		그래서 신물나
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:51	I mean, what was that about tonight?
		아까는 뭐였어?
00:37:53	 
		 
00:37:53	What's beating up the new guy going to prove?
		전학생을 패면
		뭐가 증명되는데?
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:55	or screwing with my sister
		내 여동생하고 자는 것도
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:57	or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.
		내 여자친구 동생을
		주먹으로 때리는 건?
00:37:59	 
		 
00:37:59	Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this,
		여자친구?
		어떻게 말해야될지 모르지만
00:38:01	 
		 
00:38:01	But she dumped your ass.
		널 차버렸어
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:03	Are you for real?! You want to hit me?
		진심이야?!
		날 때리고 싶어?
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	I'm on your team.
		난 니 팀원이야
00:38:06	 
		 
00:38:07	This was over the line.
		너무 심했어
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	Even for you.
		너래도 말야
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:34	Somebody help!
		누구 도와줘요!
00:38:35	 
		 
00:39:47	It wasn't just for the drugs.
		마약 때문은 아니였어
00:39:49	 
		 
00:40:03	What kind of animal could be doing all this?
		어떤 동물이 이런 짓을 한거지?
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	Why would it come out of the woods
		왜 숲속에서 튀어나와
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:07	and attack someone in the middle of town?
		마을 안에 사람을 공격하지?
00:40:09	 
		 
00:40:09	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:40:10	 
		 
00:40:10	I don't know.
		몰라
00:40:12	 
		 
00:40:14	I was so sure that you cut your hand.
		손 다친 건 확실해
00:40:17	 
		 
00:40:17	I saw it.
		봤어
00:40:18	 
		 
00:40:18	I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine, ok?
		난 괜찮을거야. 응?
00:40:21	 
		 
00:40:21	We're fine.
		우린 괜찮아
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:22	That's what matters.
		그게 중요한거지
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:41	I thought there was hope
		희망이 있다고 생각했다
00:40:43	 
		 
00:40:43	That somewhere deep inside,
		마음속 어딘가
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:45	Something in Damon was still human,
		데이먼도 여전히
		인간다운 모습이 있을거라
00:40:49	 
		 
00:40:49	normal.
		평범한 면이 있을거라
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:57	But I was wrong.
		하지만 내가 틀렸다
00:40:59	 
		 
00:40:59	There's nothing human left in Damon.
		데이먼에게 인간다운 모습은
		전혀 남아있지 않다
00:41:03	 
		 
00:41:03	No good, no kindness.
		선도 친절함도
00:41:06	 
		 
00:41:06	No love.
		사랑도 없다
00:41:07	 
		 
00:41:08	Only a monster
		오로지 멈춰야 할
00:41:10	 
		 
00:41:10	who must be stopped
		괴물일 뿐이다
00:41:13
