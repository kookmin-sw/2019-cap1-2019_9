00:00:00	Previously on "The vampire diaries"...
		지난 이야기
00:00:01	 
		For over a century, I have lived in secret.
		 
		한 세기를 걸쳐서
00:00:03	 
		Until now.
		 
		비밀을 간직한 채 살았다
00:00:04	 
		I know the risk, but I have to know her.
		 
		위험한건 알지만
		그녀를 알아야만 한다
00:00:06	 
		What are you?
		 
		정체가 뭐니?
00:00:08	 
		I'm a vampire.
		 
		뱀파이어야
00:00:09	 
		Tell me about your ex, katherine.
		 
		네가 헤어졌던 여친
		캐더린에 대해 알려줘
00:00:11	 
		I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
		 
		엘레나 더이상 만나지 마
00:00:13	 
		If you don't remove her from your life,
		 
		그녀 곁을 떠나지 않으면
00:00:15	 
		I will kill everyone that you love.
		 
		그녀가 사랑하는
		모든이들을 죽일거야
00:00:17	 
		You must be Elena.
		 
		엘레나구나
00:00:18	 
		How do we look exactly alike?
		 
		어째서 나와 똑같이 생긴거지?
00:00:19	 
		The lockwoods are werewolves?
		 
		락우드가 사람들이
		늑대인간이라고?
00:00:21	 
		The werewolf gene runs in the lockwood family.
		 
		늑대인간 유전자가 락우드가에
		전해 내려오고 있었어
00:00:24	 
		Tell me what triggers the curse!
		 
		어떻게 저주가 시작되는지 말해줘!
00:00:25	 
		You have to kill somebody!
		 
		사람을 죽여야 해!
00:00:26	 
		The werewolf part of the curse is sealed with the moonstone.
		 
		늑대인간의 저주는
		월장석에 봉인됐어
00:00:29	 
		Katherine will only rip your heart out.
		 
		캐더린은 네 심장을
		갈기갈기 찢을거라구
00:00:31	 
		Let me do it for her.
		 
		내가 대신 해주지
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:34	You have no idea what you've just done.
		방금 무슨 짓을 한건지
		전혀 모를거야
00:00:36	 
		Aww. Did I put a kink in your master plan?
		 
		네 장대한 계획에
		비상이 생긴거야?
00:00:38	 
		Do honestly believe that I don't have a plan B?
		 
		너 정말 나한테
		B플랜이 없을줄 알아?
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	Jenna, no!
		이모, 안 돼!
00:00:43	 
		We were just , sneaking around,
		 
		몰래 만나면서
00:00:44	 
		thinking we weren't going to get caught.
		 
		들키지 않을거라 생각했었지만
00:00:46	 
		But it's over.
		 
		이제 끝났어
00:00:47	 
		I'm going after Tyler Lockwood.
		 
		타일러 락우드를
		뒤쫓을 것이다
00:00:49	 
		And you're not going to stop...
		 
		멈추지 않을거지
00:00:50	 
		Until he kills me.
		 
		그가 날 죽일 때까지요
00:00:52	 
		Here.
		 
		여기
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:56	I'm still shaking.
		아직도 떨린다
00:00:58	 
		 
00:00:59	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:03	Go ahead, tell him. You're gonna love this.
		스테판한테도 얘기해 줘
		정말 좋아할걸
00:01:06	 
		I saw Katherine today.
		 
		오늘 캐더린을 봤어
00:01:07	 
		- Where? - At the grill.
		 
		- 어디서?
		- 그릴 레스토랑에
00:01:09	 
		I just stopped by to gawk and...quasi-stalk Matt.
		 
		바보같이 몰래 맷을
		스토킹하려고 들렀어
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:22	Do you need a table?
		어디 앉을래?
00:01:24	 
		No, I'm not staying.
		 
		아니, 갈거야
00:01:26	 
		I just need to use the little girl's room.
		 
		화장실 좀 쓰려고
00:01:30	 
		Skip the teen drama and get to it.
		 
		드라마는 넘어가고
		본론을 말해 봐
00:01:32	 
		Then I had to pretend to the use the bathroom,
		 
		화장실을 쓰는 척을 해야만 했지
00:01:34	 
		even though I didn't have to go, 'cause I'm a dufus.
		 
		갈 필요 없었지만 말야
		난 바보같거든
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:39	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:01:41	 
		Hey, I saw you with Matt. Are you ok?
		 
		맷하고 있는 거 봤어
		괜찮니?
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:46	Yeah, ya know...
		응, 있지..
00:01:50	 
		Whatever.
		 
		아니다
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:54	You're good.
		실력 늘었네
00:01:55	 
		What gave me away? Was it the hair or was it my clothes?
		 
		어떻게 눈치챈거야?
		내 머리 아님 내 옷?
00:01:59	 
		I know Elena's at--
		 
		엘레나는 지금..
00:02:01	 
		I know Elena's at home.
		 
		집에 있어요
00:02:04	 
		I need you to deliver a message.
		 
		메세지 전달 좀 해줘야겠어
00:02:07	 
		What was the message?
		 
		무슨 메세지였는데?
00:02:08	 
		Tell Damon and Stefan that I want the moonstone.
		 
		데이먼하고 스테판한테
		월장석을 원한다고
00:02:10	 
		Or I will rip this town apart until it rains blood.
		 
		그러지 않으면 이 마을을
		피바다로 만들거야
00:02:14	 
		Tell him the rest of it.
		 
		다 전해줘
00:02:16	 
		Tonight. At the masquerade ball.
		 
		오늘밤 가면무도회에서 보자
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:20	She wants to do it in public. Killing Mason through her off guard.
		공개적으로 하고 싶어해
		메이슨이 죽으니 제 정신이 아냐
00:02:23	 
		She's running scared.
		 
		두려워서 도망치는 거야
00:02:24	 
		What she did to jenna was desperate.
		 
		제나한테 한 짓은
		정말 필사적인 거였지
00:02:26	 
		She's out of tricks.
		 
		별다른 책략이 없는거지
00:02:27	 
		We can't underestimate her. We have to play this smarter than her.
		 
		얕보면 안되
		더 영리하게 나와야지
00:02:29	 
		Can't we just give her the moonstone so she'll leave?
		 
		가버리게 그냥
		월장석 주면 안 돼?
00:02:31	 
		No. Katherine's not getting dick.
		 
		안돼. 절대로
00:02:33	 
		I've had it.
		 
		겪어봤어
00:02:35	 
		I'm gonna go to the masquerade ball, and I'm going to kill her tonight.
		 
		가면무도회에 가서
		캐더린을 죽일거야
00:02:37	 
		You're not gonna kill her.
		 
		형은 안돼
00:02:38	 
		Don't give me that goody-goody crap.
		 
		착해지라는 헛소리는 관 둬
00:02:40	 
		- You're not going to kill her. - Oh, really?
		 
		- 죽이면 안 돼
		- 정말로?
00:02:43	 
		Because I am.
		 
		내가 죽일거니깐
00:02:44

		The Vampire Diaries 2x07
		Masquerade
00:02:52	Easy...
		진정해
00:02:54	 
		 
00:02:55	Grab the door, Jeremy.
		문 잡아, 제레미
00:02:56	 
		Stop fussing, I'm fine.
		 
		소란피우지 마
		난 멀쩡하다니까
00:02:57	 
		The doctor said that you have to take it easy.
		 
		의사가 그러길
		푹 쉬어야 한댔어
00:02:59	 
		The doctor said that you have to take it easy.
		 
00:02:59	 
		Yeah, you don't wanna rip the stitches, hemorrhage, and die, right?
		 
		그래, 실밥이 뜯어져서
		출혈로 죽을까봐?
00:03:02	 
		The only thing I'm gonna die from is embarrassment.
		 
		그것보단 쪽팔려서 죽겠네
00:03:05	 
		- No... - I "walked" into a knife.
		 
		- 아니...
		- 칼을 향해 걸어갔대
00:03:08	 
		How does somebody do that?
		 
		누가 그런짓을 하겠어?
00:03:09	 
		- It was a freak accident. - It happens.
		 
		- 별난 사고라고
		- 그런 일도 있어
00:03:12	 
		Yeah. I mean, I've done it, like, 20 times at the grill.
		 
		나도 레스토랑에서
		20번도 넘게 그랬거든요
00:03:15	 
		Ok, I'm being nice.
		 
		좋게 해드리는 건데
00:03:17	 
		All right, easy...
		 
		천천히
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:22	- What should I do with this? - I got it.
		- 이건?
		- 줘 봐
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:31	- So, what are we gonna do? - Make lunch.
		- 이젠 어쩔거야?
		- 점심 만들어야지
00:03:34	 
		About Katherine.
		 
		점심 말고
		캐더린 말야
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	We're not going to do anything, Jeremy.
		아무것도 안 할거야, 제레미
00:03:38	 
		She tried to kill Jenna. We can't let her get away with that.
		 
		제나를 죽이려고 했어
		내버려 둘 수만 없다구
00:03:40	 
		Yes, we can. If it keeps us safe, then we can.
		 
		아니, 내버려둬야 해
		그래야 안전하니까
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:44	- What if she tries something else? - She won't.
		- 다른 일을 벌이면?
		- 안 그럴거야
00:03:47	 
		Katherine hurt Jenna because I didn't do what she said.
		 
		캐더린은 제나를 다치게 했어
		그녀 명령을 따르지 않아서
00:03:50	 
		Well, I'm doing it now. Me and stefan are over.
		 
		그래서 말을 따를거야
		나랑 스테판은 끝이라구
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:53	She wins. The end.
		그녀가 이겼어
		게임 종료
00:03:56	 
		You're being naive and you know it.
		 
		순진한 척 하는거
		누나도 알거야
00:03:59	 
		Where are you going?
		 
		어디가게?
00:04:00	 
		Out. I'll be back!
		 
		밖에. 곧 올게!
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:10	Where should I put these?
		어디다 둘까요?
00:04:12	 
		Right there. Thank you, Miss Flowers.
		 
		저쪽이요
		고마워요. 플라워스씨
00:04:14	 
		You've been such a wonderful help.
		 
		정말 많은 도움을 받았습니다
00:04:16	 
		Oh, it's my pleasure, dear.
		 
		천만에요
00:04:18	 
		Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
		 
		또 도울 거 있음 알려줘요
00:04:20	 
		I will.
		 
		그럴게요
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:32	Whoa, Kat, chill.
		캣, 진정해
00:04:34	 
		Do not sneak up on a vampire.
		 
		뱀파이어를 놀래키지 마
00:04:37	 
		Don't attack a witch.
		 
		마녀 공격하지 마
00:04:40	 
		 
00:04:42	It's good to see ya, girl.
		오랫만이네
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:47	I'm glad you made it.
		여기까지 와줘서 다행이야
00:04:48	 
		You called. I came.
		 
		전화했으니 온거지
00:04:50	 
		Like you had a choice.
		 
		선택권도 없었겠지만
00:04:51	 
		Don't get all boss lady on me. You know I love you.
		 
		나한테 우두머리 행세 하지마
		사랑하는 거 알면서
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:57	Now, where does one wear this?
		그건 그렇고
		이걸 어디서 쓸 거라고?
00:05:00	 
		To a masquerade ball. Tonight.
		 
		오늘 밤 가면 무도회에서
00:05:04	 
		You can be my date.
		 
		내 동반자가 되줘
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:09	Hey, come on in.
		들어와
00:05:10	 
		I got stefan's message.
		 
		스테판 문자 받았어
00:05:11	 
		Hey, you brought the grimoire. Thank you.
		 
		주술책 가져왔구나
		고마워
00:05:14	 
		What's going on?
		 
		무슨 일이야?
00:05:16	 
		We're gonna kill Katherine.
		 
		캐더린을 죽일거에요
00:05:19	 
		- I can explain. - Please.
		 
		- 설명할게
		- 어서
00:05:23	 
		We're gonna kill Katherine.
		 
		캐더린을 죽일 계획이야
00:05:25	 
		Now, this works with compressed air.
		 
		압축 공기와 함께 작동하지
00:05:29	 
		The trigger is here.
		 
		방아쇠는 여기 있어
00:05:31	 
		I've got 2 of these in a different size.
		 
		다른 사이즈로 두 개 갖고 있어
00:05:33	 
		And for you, I recommend this.
		 
		너한텐 이 걸 추천한다
00:05:37	 
		Fits nicely under a jacket sleeve.
		 
		자켓 소매에 딱 들어맞지
00:05:39	 
		Here's the trigger when you're ready.
		 
		준비되면 여기
		방아쇠가 있어
00:05:41	 
		 
00:05:45	You wanted me to show you how to kill vampires.
		뱀파이어를 죽이는 방법을
		보여달라는 거구나
00:05:49	 
		What's with the hair?
		 
		머리는 왜 그래?
00:05:51	 
		I'm impersonating my dull as
		 
		나는 몹시 지루한
00:05:52	 
		dishwater doppelganger, Elena.
		 
		엘레나 분장을 하는 중이지
00:05:55	 
		She has the worst taste.
		 
		정말 안목이 꽝이네
00:05:56	 
		Except in men.
		 
		남자보는 눈은 빼고
00:05:59	 
		 
00:06:00	Isn't it a risk pretending to be her
		온동네 사람 앞에서
00:06:01	 
		in front of the entire town?
		 
		그녀인 척 하는거
		위험하지 않아?
00:06:03	 
		I've gotten quite good at it actually.
		 
		요즘 내 연기력이 늘었어
00:06:05	 
		And everyone's gonna be in masks.
		 
		모두들 가면을 쓸테고
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:08	It's for some feed the something charity.
		무슨 무슨 먹이를 주자는
		자선행사인데
00:06:11	 
		It's for a good cause, Lucy.
		 
		좋은 목적의 행사래
00:06:13	 
		Hmm. Ok.
		 
		좋아
00:06:15	 
		Well, have you actually seen the moonstone before?
		 
		그래서 월장석 직접 봤니?
00:06:17	 
		I always thought it was some made-up legend.
		 
		늘 지어낸 얘기로 생각했는데
00:06:19	 
		I've seen it. And I need you to help me get it back.
		 
		봤지. 되찾는 거 도와줘
00:06:21	 
		Oh, yeah? What are you going to do with it?
		 
		그래? 그걸로 어쩌게?
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:29	You want me to break the curse.
		저주를 풀어달란 거구나
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:32	Let's just get it first.
		우선 찾아내야만 해
00:06:35	 
		What I really need is for your back-up.
		 
		날 뒤에서 좀 도와줘야겠어
00:06:37	 
		I can't that imagine Damon and Stefan
		 
		데이먼하고 스테판이
00:06:38	 
		are just gonna hand it over
		 
		싸움을 붙이지 않고
00:06:39	 
		without putting up a fight.
		 
		순순히 내줄리는 없으니까
00:06:42	 
		I know you love Elena and
		 
		엘레나를 사랑하고
00:06:43	 
		you want to be with her, but it's risky.
		 
		곁에 있고 싶은거 알지만
		위험해
00:06:46	 
		Too many people could get hurt.
		 
		많은 사람들이
		다칠 수가 있어
00:06:48	 
		Look, I want Elena back, yes.
		 
		엘레나를 되찾고 싶은 건 맞아
00:06:49	 
		But it's more than that.
		 
		그 이상이지
00:06:50	 
		What Katherine did to Jenna crossed a line.
		 
		캐더린이 제나한테 한 짓은
		도를 넘었어
00:06:52	 
		And she has to be stopped before it happens again.
		 
		다시 그런 일이 생기기 전에
		멈춰야만 해
00:06:54	 
		I don't know, Stefan.
		 
		모르겠어, 스테판
00:06:56	 
		Look, Katherine knows me, all right?
		 
		캐더린은 날 알지?
00:06:57	 
		She knows that I'm not gonna
		 
		무고한 사람들로 가득찬 곳에서
00:06:58	 
		try something in a crowd full of innocent people.
		 
		내가 허튼짓을
		시도하진 않을거란걸 알고
00:07:00	 
		So, that gives me an edge.
		 
		나한테 유리한거야
00:07:01	 
		I can catch her by surprise.
		 
		불시에 기습할 수 있으니까
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:07	I could do a spell to trap her.
		그녀를 가두는
		주문을 걸게
00:07:10	 
		Like the tomb spell.
		 
		무덤에 건 주문처럼
00:07:11	 
		Right. We can isolate her away from the others.
		 
		좋아. 다른이들로부터
		격리시킬 수 있겠네
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:16	Please, Bonnie?
		제발, 보니
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:20	Ok.
		알았어
00:07:21	 
		You're welcome to hang out. Alaric's coming over.
		 
		와줘서 고마워
		알라릭도 온댔어
00:07:23	 
		It's gonna be pizza and bad TV.
		 
		피자나 먹으며
		유해한 TV나 봐야지
00:07:26	 
		I'd love to but
		 
		그러고 싶지만
00:07:28	 
		I'm going to the masquerade party at the Lockwood's.
		 
		락우드가에 가면 무도회에 가려고
00:07:29	 
		- Aren't you? - Uh, no--
		 
		- 넌 안 가니?
		- 응
00:07:31	 
		Not with what's going on with me and Stefan.
		 
		스테판하고 일이 그렇게 되서
00:07:34	 
		- I've got to go. There's something I've got to do. - What?
		 
		- 가봐야겠어. 할일이 있어서
		- 뭔데?
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:39	Just something. I can't talk about it.
		그냥 있어
		말할 수가 없어
00:07:41	 
		But, I've gotta go.
		 
		가봐야겠다
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:44	Ok. Well, have fun.
		좋아. 즐거운 시간 보내
00:07:46	 
		 
00:07:46	Yeah, me in a suit.
		그래, 양복입은 나 말이지
00:07:49	 
		You look good in a suit.
		 
		너 양복 잘 어울리던데
00:07:51	 
		You and Stefan will work it out.
		 
		너랑 스테판은
		잘 풀리게 될거야
00:07:53	 
		I don't think so, Matt.
		 
		글쎄
00:07:56	 
		There's so much about me and Stefan that will never work.
		 
		잘 풀릴 수 없는 이유가
		너무 많아서
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:02	You know I'm here for you. Always.
		위로가 필요하면 늘 내가 있잖아
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:07	You sure you guys don't want me there tonight?
		내가 정말 가지 않아도 되나?
00:08:08	 
		No, I need you to stay with Elena.
		 
		엘레나랑 있어줘요
00:08:10	 
		I don't want her to know about this.
		 
		엘레나가 우리 계획을
		알면 안되니까요
00:08:12	 
		Ok. I'll make sure she doesn't leave my sight.
		 
		알았어. 계속 엘레나를 지켜보지
00:08:15	 
		All right. If anybody wants to back out,
		 
		좋아. 누구든
		지금이라도 그만두고 싶다면
00:08:18	 
		I'll understand.
		 
		이해해줄게
00:08:20	 
		Yeah, cold feet speak now. I don't want this going wrong
		 
		겁을 먹었음 말해
00:08:22	 
		because someone chickens out. Caroline?
		 
		겁먹어서 일이 잘못되면 안되니까
		캐롤라인?
00:08:25	 
		I won't. She killed me. Fair's fair.
		 
		무섭지 않아요
		날 죽였으니까 나도 죽여야죠
00:08:28	 
		And as long as there are no werewolves running around.
		 
		늑대인간들이 날뛰지만 않는다면
00:08:30	 
		Oh, I took care of Mason.
		 
		메이슨은 내가 처리했어
00:08:31	 
		And as long as Tyler doesn't kill anyone-- he won't turn.
		 
		타일러가 사람 죽이지만 않으면
		바뀌지 않을거에요
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:37	Bonnie? Are you with us?
		보니?
		너는?
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:47	- But no one gets hurt. - Except Katherine.
		- 아무도 다쳐선 안된다
		- 캐더린 빼고
00:08:50	 
		Tonight, Katherine, gets a stake through her heart.
		 
		오늘밤 캐더린은
		심장에 말뚝을 박힐거야
00:08:52	 
		 
00:09:16	It's all ready packed out there.
		벌써 꽉 찼네
00:09:18	 
		You know, we need to keep that door shut.
		 
		저 문 좀 닫아야겠다
00:09:20	 
		Your father would be very unhappy if I let guests in here.
		 
		손님이 들어오면
		아버지가 싫어하셨을테니
00:09:23	 
		Oh, look at you. So handsome!
		 
		너 좀 봐라
		잘생겼네!
00:09:27	 
		Thanks. You look pretty good too, mom.
		 
		고마워요
		엄마도 아름다우세요
00:09:29	 
		Oh, a compliment-- I think I'll fall over.
		 
		칭찬까지 하다니
		쓰러지겠네
00:09:33	 
		Listen.
		 
		저기요
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	I'm sorry I've been a dick lately--jerk lately.
		요즘에 싸가지 없게
		아니 못되게 굴어서 죄송해요
00:09:39	 
		It's just...
		 
		그게..
00:09:42	 
		Have you heard from Mason?
		 
		메이슨 삼촌 소식 들으셨어요?
00:09:44	 
		No, and I don't think we're going to.
		 
		아니, 계속 못 들을 것 같다
00:09:47	 
		He's coming. He's going. It's just his way.
		 
		왔다가 또 금방 떠나고
		늘 그랬잖니
00:09:49	 
		He's the exact opposite of your father.
		 
		네 아버지와 정반대야
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:55	We should have cancelled this party.
		파티 취소할 걸 그랬어요
00:09:58	 
		This whole masquerade theme was his idea.
		 
		가면을 주제로 한 파티는
		다 네 아버지 생각이었다
00:10:02	 
		I don't know what it has to do with helping the homeless,
		 
		노숙자들 돕는거랑
		무슨 연관인지 모르겠지만
00:10:05	 
		but once he made up his mind, he could really be a dick.
		 
		한번 마음을 먹으면
		굽히질 않지
00:10:09	 
		A jerk.
		 
		못되게 말이다
00:10:12	 
		But I loved him.
		 
		하지만 난 네 아버질 사랑했어
00:10:14	 
		And I know you did too.
		 
		너도 그랬고
00:10:17	 
		It's natural to feel abandoned.
		 
		버려진 기분이 드는건
		자연스러운 거야
00:10:20	 
		I just don't want you to feel alone.
		 
		외로운 기분은
		갖지 않길 바란다
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:25	Come on, put your mask on.
		가면 써봐요
00:10:29	 
		Let's just go out there and pretend to have some fun.
		 
		나가서 즐기는 척 하자구요
00:10:32	 
		I think I need a cocktail first.
		 
		칵테일 먼저
		마시고 가야겠다
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:50	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:10:51	 
		Matt? You look dashing.
		 
		맷? 정말 멋있다
00:10:54	 
		I thought you said you weren't coming.
		 
		안 온다는 줄 알았는데
00:10:57	 
		I couldn't miss it.
		 
		빠질 수가 없었어
00:10:59	 
		You really are hot in a suit. I'd love to just...
		 
		너 정말 섹시하다
		그냥..
00:11:03	 
		Ok, here's the deal.
		 
		이렇게 하자
00:11:06	 
		Do you know what you have to do?
		 
		뭘 해야하는지 알지?
00:11:08	 
		I'm going to get Tyler Lockwood really drunk.
		 
		타일러 락우드를
		취하게 만들겁니다
00:11:11	 
		I'm going to start a fight with him.
		 
		싸움을 붙일거구요
00:11:12	 
		And I'm going to beat him until he snaps.
		 
		달려들기 전까지
		계속 팰겁니다
00:11:15	 
		- And then? - I won't stop until he kills me.
		 
		그리곤? / 날 죽일때까지
		멈추지 않을겁니다
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:20	God, you're hot.
		정말 섹시하다
00:11:23	 
		- Now, go away. - Thank you.
		 
		- 이제 가봐
		- 고마워요
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:27	- Do you see her? - No.
		- 보여?
		- 아니
00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:31	Are you sure you can do this?
		할 수 있겠어?
00:11:33	 
		Who are you talking to?
		 
		누구한테 말하는거야?
00:11:34	 
		I had the chance to kill her, and I hesitated.
		 
		난 죽일 기회가 있었지만
		머뭇거렸거든
00:11:37	 
		Well, that is the fork in the road between you and me, my friend.
		 
		그게 바로
		너와 나의 차이점이지
00:11:40	 
		I don't hesitate.
		 
		난 머뭇거리지 않아
00:11:41	 
		You spent 145 years loving her. It could happen.
		 
		형은 145년을 사랑하며 보냈잖아
		있을 수 있는 일이라구
00:11:44	 
		I won't hesitate.
		 
		난 주저하지 않을거야
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:47	All right.
		알았어
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:57	We're really not supposed to be in here.
		여기 있으면 안 돼
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:01	Yeah, I know.
		알아
00:12:02	 
		But we really need to turn this party up.
		 
		파티 좀 제대로 해보자고
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:07	- Another shot? - Hey, I want a shot.
		- 한 잔 더할래?
		- 나 마시고 싶어
00:12:10	 
		- Me too. And then we have to dance. - Yes.
		 
		- 나도. 춤추자
		- 좋아
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	You know, usually it's me corrupting you. I like this.
		보통은 내가 널
		꼬득였는데. 맘에 든다
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:19	Okay, let's go party. Come on
		파티하러 가자. 어서
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:36	I thought this room could work.
		이 방이 적절할 거 같아
00:12:38	 
		It's perfect.
		 
		완벽해
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:45	Is that the spellbook I read about in my family's old journal?
		우리 가문의 오래된 일기장에서
		본 그 주문책이 맞아?
00:12:47	 
		It was my ancestor, Emily's.
		 
		우리 조상이신
		에밀리꺼야
00:12:49	 
		The spell I'm doing here is similar to the one
		 
		내가 여기서 거는 주문은
00:12:50	 
		that sealed the vampires into the tomb.
		 
		무덤에 뱀파이어들을 봉인하는데
		쓰인 주문과 비슷해
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:58	Can you do all the stuff that's in there?
		거기 써있는 주문은
		다 할 수 있어?
00:13:00	 
		It takes practice.
		 
		연습이 필요해
00:13:01	 
		I've worked on some small spells.
		 
		사소한 주문은 걸어봤어
00:13:03	 
		Spells that only do good. I don't wanna know too much.
		 
		좋은 쪽으로 통하는 주문들
		많이 알고 싶지는 않아
00:13:07	 
		I don't particularly enjoy any of this,
		 
		네가 눈치 못 챘다면
00:13:10	 
		in case you haven't noticed.
		 
		난 이런 거 하나도 즐기지 않아
00:13:11	 
		But you're 100% witch. That is so cool.
		 
		100프로 마녀가 맞잖아
		정말 멋져
00:13:14	 
		It's anything but cool.
		 
		전혀 멋지지 않아
00:13:16	 
		Did your family journals tell you what happened to Emily?
		 
		네 조상님의 일기장에
		에밀리한테 생긴 일도 써있니?
00:13:19	 
		Or how about my grams?
		 
		아니면 우리 할머니는?
00:13:22	 
		It never ends well for people like me.
		 
		나 같은 사람들은
		좋게 끝나지 않더라
00:13:25	 
		If you feel that way, why help?
		 
		그렇게 느껴지면
		왜 돕는거야?
00:13:27	 
		Because I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
		 
		다른 사람이 다치는 걸
		보고 싶지 않거든
00:13:30	 
		And...I don't know how to stay out of it.
		 
		난.. 벗어날 방법을 모르겠어
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:38	I feel like an invalid.
		병자가 된 기분이다
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:41	That's because you are an invalid.
		병자가 맞으니까 그런거야
00:13:43	 
		Where's Jeremy? Isn't he hungry?
		 
		제레미는 어디있어?
		배 안 고프대?
00:13:44	 
		He already left for the Lockwood party.
		 
		락우드가 파티를 위해
		벌써 떠났어
00:13:48	 
		- He went to that? - I'm glad. He needs to have more fun.
		 
		- 거길 갔다고?
		- 잘된거야. 즐길 시간도 필요하니
00:13:52	 
		Lose some of that emo-thing.
		 
		고뇌하는 모습 좀 덜게
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:56	I'm gonna get some napkins.
		냅킨 좀 가져올게
00:13:59	 
		 
00:14:00	What's going on?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:14:02	 
		What do you mean?
		 
		무슨 뜻이야
00:14:04	 
		I haven't heard from anyone all day.
		 
		하루종일 연락이 없었어요
00:14:06	 
		It's like everyone's been avoiding me.
		 
		다들 날 피하는 것 같아요
00:14:07	 
		And now Jeremy's supposedly at the party?
		 
		이젠 제레미가
		파티를 갔다구요?
00:14:10	 
		He hates stuff like that.
		 
		그런 거 싫어하는 애란 말예요
00:14:12	 
		I don't know what to tell you, Elena.
		 
		뭐라고 해야할지
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:17	So then you'll be ok if I just head out,
		그럼 저 그냥 나가서
00:14:19	 
		and try and meet up with everyone?
		 
		사람 좀 만나도 괜찮죠?
00:14:21	 
		Wait. Wait. Wait.
		 
		잠깐만
00:14:23	 
		What are you hiding, Rick?
		 
		뭘 숨기시는 거죠?
00:14:25	 
		Stefan asked me to keep an eye on you,
		 
		스테판은 널 지켜보라고 부탁했어
00:14:28	 
		just in case Katherine showed up while he was at the party.
		 
		파티에 간 동안
		캐더린이 나타날까봐
00:14:32	 
		So, Stefan's at the party too?
		 
		스테판도 파티에 갔단 뜻인가요?
00:14:34	 
		He would never go to the party for himself.
		 
		자신을 위해
		파티를 갈 스테판이 아녜요
00:14:36	 
		He did that stuff for me.
		 
		날 위해서 그런델 갔었다구요
00:14:37	 
		Just let this one go. Ok, Elena?
		 
		이번엔 신경쓰지 마라
		알았지?
00:14:42	 
		We need to let Stefan and Damon know the room's ready.
		 
		스테판하고 데이먼한테
		다 준비 됐다고 말해야해
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:50	Do you feel that?
		느껴져?
00:14:51	 
		What's the matter? You cold?
		 
		왜 그래 누나? 추워?
00:14:54	 
		No.
		 
		아니
00:14:56	 
		 
00:15:05	Excuse me? Do I know you?
		실례하지만
		절 아시나요?
00:15:07	 
		Nope. I'm a plus one.
		 
		아뇨. 친구 따라 왔어요
00:15:09	 
		I know no one. It's a great party though.
		 
		아무도 몰라요
		파티 참 재미있네요
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:19	You Ok?
		괜찮아?
00:15:20	 
		Just got a weird vibe.
		 
		이상한 기운이 들어서
00:15:21	 
		Let's find Damon.
		 
		데이먼 찾자
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:42	Dance with me.
		나랑 춤 춰
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:48	No.
		싫어
00:15:50	 
		Fine. You tell me who I should kill.
		 
		좋아. 누굴 죽여야할지 말해줘
00:15:54	 
		Him? She looks delicious.
		 
		쟤? 쟤 맛있어 보인다
00:15:57	 
		 
00:16:16	It's a beautiful night.
		아름다운 밤이야
00:16:18	 
		Why the charade?
		 
		왜 연기를 하는 거야?
00:16:21	 
		How's Jenna? I certainly didn't expect her to survive that.
		 
		제나는 어때?
		살아남을 줄 몰랐는데
00:16:26	 
		Lucky girl. Clumsy.
		 
		운도 좋지
		서투르긴 해도
00:16:27	 
		How does one stab oneself?
		 
		어떻게 자기 배를 직접 찌른대?
00:16:30	 
		- Katherine. - Hmm?
		 
		- 캐더린
		- 응?
00:16:32	 
		I don't want anyone to get hurt tonight.
		 
		난 아무도 다치는 걸 보고 싶지 않아
00:16:34	 
		OK. Then give me the moonstone and nobody will.
		 
		좋아. 그럼 월장석 주면
		아무도 다치지 않을거야
00:16:37	 
		Well, see I don't have the moonstone on me.
		 
		난 월장석 안 갖고 있어
00:16:40	 
		So, you and I will have to go get it together.
		 
		그러니까 너랑 내가
		같이 가져와야 겠다
00:16:45	 
		Hmm. I have a better plan.
		 
		더 좋은 생각이 있어
00:16:47	 
		You go fetch it.
		 
		네가 가서 가져와
00:16:48	 
		And I will try not to kill anyone in the meantime.
		 
		난 그동안
		아무도 안죽이도록 노력할게
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:53	My way... Or you don't get it.
		내 방법이 아니면
		못 가져
00:16:57	 
		Hey, Stefan, I can't find Matt.
		 
		스테판
		맷 못 찾겠어
00:17:00	 
		Oh my god, Elena, you look so pretty.
		 
		세상에, 엘레나
		너 참 예쁘다
00:17:03	 
		I love that dress. You look gorge.
		 
		드레스가 맘에 들어
		정말 눈부시다
00:17:06	 
		- Thank you. I love your necklace. - Oh, thanks.
		 
		- 고마워. 목걸이 예쁘다
		- 고마워
00:17:09	 
		Oh, it's twisted. Here, let me. Here we go.
		 
		줄이 꼬였네
		내가 좀 해줄게
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:17	Paralyzed from the waist down.
		흉부 마비
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:20	And dead.
		죽었네
00:17:21	 
		The moonstone, Stefan. Tick-tock.
		 
		월장석 찾아
		시간 얼마 없다구
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:29	Hey, guys. I'm gonna go to bed. You good over there?
		나 자러 갈건데
		괜찮아요?
00:17:33	 
		- 'Night. - Goodnight.
		 
		- 안녕히 주무세요
		- 잘 자라
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:47	I put her body in the trunk for now.
		시체는 잠시 트렁크에 놨어
00:17:49	 
		We can dump her when we get back.
		 
		돌아오면 버리자
00:17:51	 
		This is what I didn't want, Damon.
		 
		이건 원치 않는거야
00:17:53	 
		Stefan, it's collateral damage.
		 
		스테판, 부수적 피해가 생긴거야
00:17:55	 
		Right, which is why we need to call it off.
		 
		맞다, 그러니까
		중단해야 해
00:17:58	 
		What? Who's hesitating now?
		 
		왜? 이젠 누가 주저하는 거지?
00:18:00	 
		Hey. Don't do this to me!
		 
		나한테 이러지 마!
00:18:03	 
		This woman ruined our lives. She destroyed us.
		 
		이 여자가 우리 삶을 망쳤어
		우릴 파멸시켰다구
00:18:06	 
		Tonight it ends.
		 
		오늘 밤에 끝내자
00:18:09	 
		We can do it together. I got your back.
		 
		같이 하는거야
		내가 도와줄게
00:18:13	 
		- All right? - All right.
		 
		- 알았어?
		- 그래
00:18:16	 
		So, can you like do a hocus pocus to ace a test?
		 
		시험 A받는
		요술을 부릴 수 있어?
00:18:19	 
		I don't know that spell.
		 
		그 주문은 아직 안 배웠어
00:18:21	 
		That'd be like the first one I'd learn.
		 
		나라면 제일 먼저 배울거야
00:18:23	 
		Maybe like a sex spell or something. I don't know.
		 
		유혹의 마술이라던가
00:18:26	 
		You wanna or dance or something while we wait?
		 
		기다리는 동안
		춤 추고 싶어?
00:18:28	 
		No!
		 
		싫어!
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:33	I mean, no thank you.
		아니, 고맙지만 사양할게
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:48	You didn't tell me there was another witch here.
		다른 마녀가 있단 거 말 안했잖아
00:18:50	 
		- Didn't I? - No, you didn't.
		 
		- 그랬나?
		- 그래
00:18:53	 
		No one is supposed to know I'm involved.
		 
		내가 관여한 다는 걸
		아무도 알아선 안된다구
00:18:55	 
		- This changes things, Katherine. - This changes nothing.
		 
		- 상황이 달라졌어
		- 아무것도 안 달라져
00:18:58	 
		You're here because you owe your dear friend a favor.
		 
		넌 네 친구의
		부탁을 들어주러 온거야
00:19:01	 
		You wouldn't want to lose my friendship, now would you?
		 
		우정을 잃고 싶지는 않지?
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:06	Elena.
		엘레나
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:10	Hey, sorry. Could I--could I talk to my sister?
		미안해요. 우리 누나랑
		얘기해도 될까요?
00:19:14	 
		 
00:19:19	What is it, Jeremy?
		그거 뭐야, 제레미?
00:19:21	 
		- I have a message from Stefan. - Oh?
		 
		- 스테판이 메세지 전해달래
		- 그래?
00:19:24	 
		He and Damon want you to meet them at the edge of the lake by the woods.
		 
		스테판과 데이먼이 숲속
		호숫가에서 만나재
00:19:27	 
		They brought the moonstone.
		 
		월장석 가져왓다고
00:19:28	 
		And why are you their little messenger?
		 
		네가 왜 메세지를 전달하는 거야?
00:19:32	 
		Because they know I'm not afraid of you.
		 
		난 당신을
		두려워하지 않으니까
00:19:34	 
		Ohh. You Gilbert men. So courageous.
		 
		길버트가 남자답군
		아주 용감하셔
00:19:38	 
		How's John, by the way?
		 
		존은 어때?
00:19:41	 
		Were they able to sew his fingers back on?
		 
		손가락 다시 꼬매셨다나?
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:56	What the hell is going on?!
		대체 무슨 일이야?
00:19:58	 
		 
00:20:06	Sorry.
		미안
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:10	Let's go.
		가자
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:44	What are Stefan and Damon up to?
		스테판하고 데이먼
		무슨 꿍꿍이야?
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:47	What do you mean?
		무슨 뜻이야?
00:20:48	 
		I've got Jeremy Gilbert luring me out to the lake.
		 
		제레미 길버트가
		호수로 유인을 하더군
00:20:50	 
		What's going on?
		 
		무슨 일이 있는 거냐고?
00:20:52	 
		 
00:20:52	I don't know...nothing.
		난.. 아무것도 몰라요
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:57	Don't lie to me, Caroline.
		거짓말 하지마, 캐롤라인
00:20:58	 
		They're up to something.
		 
		뭔가 꾸미고 있어
00:20:59	 
		What is it?
		 
		그게 뭐야?
00:21:00	 
		I..
		 
		난..
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:02	Wait, no. Ok.
		잠깐. 좋아요
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:05	they're trying to kill you.
		당신을 죽이려고 해요
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:08	I figured as much. Where's the moonstone?
		그럴 줄 알았어
		월장석은 어디있지?
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	Bonnie has it.
		보니가 갖고 있어요
00:21:11	 
		And where's Bonnie right now?
		 
		지금 보니는 어디있지?
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:14	I don't know.
		모르겠어요
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:17	Ok. She's upstairs. She's upstairs.
		좋아요. 윗층에 있어요
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:20	You guys are trying to kill her here?
		여기서 죽이겠다는 거야?
00:21:21	 
		We saw an opportunity, and knew we had to take it.
		 
		우린 기회를 보았어
		그 기회를 잡아야 하지
00:21:24	 
		Ok. Stop with the "We." Are you guys crazy?
		 
		'우리'라고 하지 마
		너희 제 정신이니?
00:21:25	 
		You could get yourselves killed.
		 
		죽을수도 있다구
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	We know what we're doing, Elena.
		우리가 뭘하는지 알아
00:21:28	 
		And how am I supposed to feel
		 
		나 때문에
		누가 다치면
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	if one of you gets hurt because of me?
		나는 어쩌라고?
00:21:31	 
		It's not just you anymore, Elena.
		 
		누나 일 만이 아냐
00:21:33	 
		She's messed with all of us.
		 
		우리 모두를 가지고 놀고 있어
00:21:34	 
		She has to be stopped.
		 
		멈춰야만 해
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:38	Why do you keep dragging me into this?
		왜 날 자꾸 끌어들이는 거에요?
00:21:40	 
		I don't want to be a part of it.
		 
		별로 끼고 싶지 않다구요
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	Shut up. Which room is it?
		입 다물어
		무슨 방이야?
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:48	It's that one.
		저기요
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:55	Where is she?
		보니는 어디있지?
00:21:56	 
		 
00:22:01	I did it.
		성공했다
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	I really didn't think that I'd be able to fool you.
		당신을 속일 수 있을지 몰랐어
00:22:07	 
		But I did it.
		 
		근데 해냈네
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:12	What the...?
		대체..?
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:16	Stefan?
		스테판
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:20	Hello, Katherine.
		안녕, 캐더린
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:22	Goodbye, Katherine.
		잘 가, 캐더린
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:28	You don't really think
		너 정말 내가
00:22:29	 
		that you can kill me with that, now do you?
		 
		그걸로 죽일수 있다 생각했어?
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:34	No.
		아니
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:38	But he can.
		데이먼이
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:42	Elena!
		엘레나!
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:43	Elena!
		엘레나!
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:45	What is it?
		왜 그래?
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:54	What's happening?!
		무슨 일이야?
00:22:55	 
		 
00:23:01	What's going on?!
		무슨 일이 생긴거냐고!
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:03	Jeremy, it's Katherine!
		제레미, 캐더린 때문이야!
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:05	She's linked to Katherine!
		캐더린하고 연결되었어
00:23:06	 
		Get them to stop, now!
		 
		멈추러 가, 어서!
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:53	Stop! You're hurting Elena.
		그만해요! 엘레나한테도
		고통을 주고 있어요
00:23:55	 
		Everything you're doing to her is hurting Elena.
		 
		캐더린한테 하는 모든 게
		누나를 해치고 있어요
00:23:57	 
		 
00:24:04	You think you two are the only ones
		너 정말 너희 둘한테만
		마녀가 있을줄 알았니?
00:24:05	 
		with a witch on your side?
		너 정말 너희 둘한테만
		마녀가 있을줄 알았니?
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:07	Wrong. And something tells me
		틀렸어
00:24:08	 
		that my witch is better than your witch.
		 
		내 마녀가 니네 마녀보다
		잘한다는게 느껴지네
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:13	Jeremy, go check on Elena. Make sure she's ok.
		제레미, 엘레나 확인하러 가
		괜찮은지 보고
00:24:15	 
		Go!
		 
		어서!
00:24:16	 
		Let's all make sure poor Elena is ok.
		 
		가엾은 엘레나가
		괜찮은가 확인하자
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:20	Little bit more pressure.
		조금 압력을 줘서
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:27	Bonnie, it hurts.
		보니, 너무 아파
00:24:28	 
		I can't break the spell, Elena. I'm sorry.
		 
		주문을 깰 수 없어
		미안, 에레나
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	But I can try to take some of the pain away. Ok?
		고통을 줄이는
		주문은 시도해볼게, 알았지?
00:24:33	 
		 
00:24:33	Ok? Ok.
		알았어
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:37	ascinda, mulaf, hinto, ascinda...
		 
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:41	This is really going to hurt.
		정말 아플거야
00:24:43	 
		Wait!
		 
		잠깐!
00:24:44	 
		 
00:24:50	Ok. So, how about that moonstone?
		좋아. 그럼
		월장석은 어떻게 됐지?
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:57	Are you ok?
		누나 괜찮아?
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	I'm gonna be.
		괜찮아질거야
00:24:59	 
		They're stuck in there with her.
		 
		같이 갇혀있어
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:00	You were right.
		맞았어
00:25:01	 
		Katherine had a witch link Elena to her.
		 
		캐더린은 마녀를 통해
		엘레나한테 주문을 걸었어
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:04	That girl I saw.
		내가 봤던 여자
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:06	The one inside.
		안에 있던 여자
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	Stay with her. Keep pressure on her shoulder.
		같이 있어
		어깨를 꽉 누르고
00:25:09	 
		Where are you going?
		 
		어디가게?
00:25:10	 
		There's another witch here, I'm gonna find her.
		 
		마녀가 또 있다면
		찾아야만 해
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:16	- No. - Take this.
		- 아니
		- 이거 받아
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	No. Jeremy...
		아니, 제레미
00:25:18	 
		Elena, please. Listen to me.
		 
		누나, 제발
		들어봐
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:20	You need this more than I do.
		나보다 누나한테 더 필요해
00:25:21	 
		No, Jeremy. What I need is for you to be safe.
		 
		아니, 제레미
		난 네가 안전하길 원해
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:25	The three of us together, just like old times.
		우리 셋이 이렇게 있으니
		옛시절같은데
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	The brother who loved me too much.
		날 너무 사랑하던 형제 말이지
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:30	And the one that didn't love me enough.
		한명은 날 충분히
		사랑해주지 않았고
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:32	And the evil slut vampire who only loved herself.
		자기만을 사랑한
		악한 걸레 뱀파이어도 있고
00:25:34	 
		 
00:25:35	What happened to you, Damon?
		너 어떻게 된거야, 데이먼?
00:25:37	 
		You used to be so sweet and polite?
		 
		참 다정하고 공손했었는데
00:25:38	 
		Oh, that Damon died a long time ago.
		 
		그 데이먼은 오래전에 죽었어
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:41	Good. He was a bore.
		좋아. 지루했었으니까
00:25:43	 
		Why don't you two stop antagonizing each other.
		 
		서로 대립은 그만 하지
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:47	Where's the moonstone?
		월장석 어디있어?
00:25:48	 
		What do you want with it?
		 
		그걸로 뭘 하려고?
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:51	Does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar?
		엘레나가 둘 다
		구애하는 걸 즐기나?
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:56	That was really desperate, Katherine.
		정말 필사적이군
00:25:59	 
		Don't you think that we can see through you?
		 
		네 속이 훤히 보이는거 알아?
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:02	So it doesn't bother you
		신경쓰이지 않아?
00:26:03	 
		that Damon is in love with your girlfriend?
		 
		데이먼이 네 여친과
		사랑에 빠졌다는 거
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:06	Stop.
		그만해
00:26:07	 
		Of what? You'll hurt me?
		 
		아님 뭐?
		날 해치려고?
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:11	Come on, Stefan.
		왜 이래, 스테판
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	Everything that I feel, Elena feels.
		내가 느끼는 모든건
		엘레나도 느껴
00:26:15	 
		So, go ahead.
		 
		그러니 계속 해 봐
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:17	Or better yet.
		아니면
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:20	Kiss me, Damon.
		키스해줘, 데이먼
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:22	She'll feel that too.
		그것도 느낄거야
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:24	You know, this whole Mason thing has me a bit confused.
		있지, 메이슨 일은
		정말 혼란스러웠어
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:27	Why a werewolf?
		왜 늑대인간을?
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:29	The moonstone can break a curse
		월장석은 저주를 깰 수 있어
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	that would help them destroy all vampires.
		그러면 뱀파이어를
		파멸시키게 될거고
00:26:32	 
		So, what's in that for you?
		 
		그럼 네가 얻는게 뭔데?
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:35	Sorry about your pet wolf.
		네 늑대 애완견은 안됐어
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	You should have kept him on a tighter leash.
		더 꽉 묶어두지 그랬어
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	I'll have to remember that for next time.
		다음번엔 기억해야겠네
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	He's not the only wolf in town.
		마을에 있는 늑대는
		메이슨 뿐이 아냐
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:45	So what happened to Aimee?
		에이미는 어떻게 됐어?
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:47	I don't know. She disappeared.
		모르겠어
		사라졌거든
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	She's probably drunk somewhere.
		어디선가 취해 있겠지
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Like me.
		나처럼
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:53	Whoa, don't do that.
		그러지 마
00:26:55	 
		 
00:26:55	What, man? It's a party.
		왜? 파티인걸
00:26:57	 
		 
00:26:59	Right, dad?
		맞죠, 아버님?
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:03	You know, it looks like your dad...
		있지, 네 아버지 같이 생겼네
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:06	wants a drink.
		한 잔 드려야 겠다
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	Hey. That's not cool.
		그거 괜찮지 않아
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:11	What is wrong with you?
		대체 왜 그래?
00:27:12	 
		The guy was a dick.
		 
		정말 나쁜놈이었잖아
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:14	Come on, you're being mean. His dad's dead.
		무례하게 굴지 마
		돌아가신 분한테
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:19	Gimme the picture. Whoa!
		액자 내놔
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:21	Remember how your dad used to slap you around?
		네 아버지가 널
		때리던 거 기억나?
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:25	Are you kidding?
		농담하는 거야?
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	Just having fun.
		재미 좀 보자는데
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:29	Put the picture down, man.
		액자 내려놔, 어서
00:27:31	 
		 
00:27:33	You need to calm your drunk ass down right now!
		네 술취한 엉덩이
		진정 좀 시키라고!
00:27:35	 
		Do something about it.
		 
		그럼 막아봐
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:37	I'm not going to fight you.
		너랑 싸우지 않을거야
00:27:38	 
		 
00:28:00	What is going on?!
		무슨 일이야?
00:28:01	 
		 
00:28:02	Stop!
		그만해!
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:06	Stop!
		멈춰!
00:28:07	 
		I can't. Let me go. I have to finish.
		 
		그럴 수 없어
		놔줘, 끝장을 봐겠어
00:28:09	 
		- What the hell is wrong with you?! - Let me go!
		 
		- 너 왜 그러는거야?!
		- 놔 달라고!
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:19	Matt?
		맷?
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:22	Matt?
		맷?
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:25	How did you--
		어떻게
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:28	Matt failed. If Matt fails, I can't.
		맷이 실패했네
		맷이 실패하면 안돼
00:28:32	 
		 
00:28:34	Tyler, look out!
		타일러, 조심해!
00:28:35	 
		 
00:28:47	Oh, my god. Sarah.
		세상에, 새라
00:28:49	 
		Sarah, open your eyes. Wake up.
		 
		새라, 눈 떠봐. 일어나
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:54	This can't happen.
		이럴 수 없어
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:56	This can't happen.
		이런 일이 생길 순 없다구
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	This can't be happening. Sarah! Sarah, get up!
		안돼
		새라, 일어나!
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:02	Sarah! Open your eyes!
		눈 뜨라구!
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:06	Oh, god.
		세상에
00:29:07	 
		 
00:29:07	This can't be happening.
		이럴수가
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:26	Tyler!
		타일러!
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:29	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:29:30	 
		 
00:29:31	Tyler, what's happening?
		타일러, 무슨 일이니?
00:29:33	 
		- Get away! - What's happening?!
		 
		- 저리 비켜!
		- 무슨 일이야?
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:44	Damn it. Where's that witch?
		젠장, 그 마녀는 어디 있지?
00:29:46	 
		 
00:29:47	We could play charades?
		맞추기 게임 해볼래?
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:49	You bargained the moonstone.
		월장석을 가지고
		거래를 했지
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:51	What are you mumbling about over there?
		뭐라고 중얼거리는 거야?
00:29:53	 
		When you struck a deal with George Lockwood
		 
		조지 락우드와
		거래를 할 때
00:29:54	 
		to help you fake your death,
		 
		널 죽인척 숨기기 위해서
00:29:55	 
		you told me that you gave George something that he needed.
		 
		조지한테 필요한걸
		주겠다고 약속했지
00:29:59	 
		 
00:29:59	It was the moonstone, wasn't it?
		그게 월장석 맞지?
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:01	Good for you, Stefan, 2+2...
		정답이야
		스테판 2 더하기 2는..
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	And it would have worked,
		먹히질 않았지
00:30:05	 
		except that people found out I wasn't in the tomb.
		 
		사람들이 내가 무덤속에
		없단 걸 알아내서 말야
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:08	Thanks to you.
		네 덕에 말이지
00:30:09	 
		By the way, have I mentioned how inconvenient
		 
		나에 대한 집착 때문에
		얼마나 불편했는줄 알아?
00:30:12	 
		your obsession with me has been?
		 
		나에 대한 집착 때문에
		얼마나 불편했는줄 알아?
00:30:14	 
		You and me both, honey.
		 
		너랑 나 둘 다 말이지
00:30:16	 
		Why do you need it back?
		 
		무엇 때문에
		돌려받으려는 거야?
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:22	I love you in a suit. So dashing.
		양복 입은거 맘에 들어
		정말 멋져
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	And what were you doing with it in the first place?
		애초에 그걸로
		뭘 했던 거야?
00:30:28	 
		You're wasting your breath, Stefan.
		 
		시간 낭비하지 마
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:31	Unless, it wasn't yours to begin with.
		처음부터 네 것이
		아니었다면 모를까
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:35	In 1864, you faked your death.
		1864년에 죽음을 위조했지
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:38	Who were you running from, Katherine?
		누구한테서
		도망쳤던 거야?
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	In 1987, you were in Chicago,
		1987년에는
		시카고에 있었지
00:30:43	 
		and a concert of all places.
		 
		콘서트나 다니면서
00:30:44	 
		With that wench Lexi.
		 
		매춘부같은 렉시와
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:47	Come on, Stefan. Don't look so surprised.
		스테판
		놀란 척 하지마
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:50	Of course, I checked in on you over the years.
		물론 몇 년 간
		널 찾아다녔어
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:55	You were standing in the front row dancing all night.
		넌 맨 앞좌석에 서서
		계속 춤을 췄었지
00:30:58	 
		 
00:30:59	You were watching Bon Jovi, and I was watching you.
		넌 본 조비를 보고 있었고
		난 널 지켜보고 있었어
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:05	Who were you running from?
		누구한테서 도망쳤던 거야?
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:11	I love you.
		사랑해
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:31	You looking for me?
		날 찾았니?
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	Who are you?
		누구세요?
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:34	Lucy.
		루시
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐하는 거죠?
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:38	I should have known I'd run into a Bennett.
		베넷가 사람을
		마주칠 줄은 몰랐네
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:41	How do you know me?
		날 어떻게 알죠?
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:43	you figure it out.
		생각해 봐
00:31:44	 
		Look, I have no interest in fighting you.
		 
		난 너랑 싸울 생각 없어
00:31:46	 
		Then stop the spell you put on my friend.
		 
		그럼 제 친구한테 걸은
		주문 좀 멈춰주세요
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	Give Katherine the moonstone, and I will.
		캐더린한테 월장석을 주면
		그렇게 할게
00:31:50	 
		Why are you helping Katherine?
		 
		왜 캐더린을 돕는 거죠?
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:52	Don't you know what she is?
		그녀 정체가 뭔줄 몰라?
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	Tell your friends to hand over the moonstone
		네 친구들한테
		월장석 건내라고 해
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	and all will be groovy.
		그럼 원상복귀 될테니
00:31:58	 
		 
00:31:59	You're not leaving this room until you stop the spell.
		주문을 멈추기 전까진
		이 방을 떠날 수 없어요
00:32:03	 
		I don't wanna hurt you.
		 
		널 해치고 싶지 않다
00:32:04	 
		I don't wanna hurt you.
		 
		나도 마찬가지에요
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:08	Look, I don't have a choice.
		선택권이 없어
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:10	The bitch saved my life, and now I owe her.
		그 년이 날 구해줘서
		빚을 진거지
00:32:13	 
		I have to pay up.
		 
		보답을 해줘야 해
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:18	You have the moonstone.
		월장석을 갖고 있군
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:21	I can sense it on you.
		너한테 느껴져
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:26	You feel that?
		느껴지니?
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:29	You can trust me.
		날 믿어도 돼
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:33	Give it to me.
		주렴
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:36	It's ok.
		괜찮아
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:39	we're missing the party.
		파티 놓쳤네
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:43	I'll have one of those.
		나도 그거 하나 갖고 있는데
00:32:45	 
		 
00:32:46	right away, miss Katherine.
		바로 대령하죠
		캐더린양
00:32:48	 
		 
00:32:52	Thank you.
		고마워
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:59	No! Damon, don't.
		아니, 데이먼
		안 돼
00:33:01	 
		Yes, Damon, please.
		 
		그래, 데이먼, 제발
00:33:03	 
		The second the spell is lifted,
		 
		그 주문이 풀리는 순간
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	I'm gonna drive this stake right through your heart.
		네 심장에 깊숙히 박을거야
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:08	God, you're hot.
		너 정말 섹시하다
00:33:09	 
		 
00:33:09	When did you get so hot?
		언제 이렇게 섹시해졌니?
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:17	Katherine...
		캐더린
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:19	The spell in this room has been broken.
		이 방의 주문은 풀렸어
00:33:21	 
		You're free to leave.
		 
		이제 떠나도 돼
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:22	Thank god.
		다행이군
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:24	When I hand this over,
		이걸 건내주면
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:26	my debt to you is over.
		내 빚은 끝난거야
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:27	Done.
		끝이야
00:33:28	 
		I owe you nothing.
		 
		아무것도 빚진게 없지
00:33:29	 
		I said "Done." Give it.
		 
		끝이랬잖아
		줘봐
00:33:31	 
		I wouldn't do that.
		 
		나라면 안 그럴걸
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:42	You should have told me another witch involved.
		다른 마녀가 연관된
		일이란 걸 알려줬어야지
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:48	She's a Bennett witch, Katherine.
		베넷가 마녀라구, 캐더린
00:33:49	 
		But I'm sure you knew that.
		 
		너도 알고 있었구나
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:52	Wait, Elena--
		엘레나
00:33:53	 
		Elena's fine.
		 
		엘레나는 멀쩡해요
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:56	The spell is broken. She'll heal quickly.
		주문이 풀렸어요
		빨리 회복될거에요
00:33:57	 
		Bonnie's with her.
		 
		보니랑 같이 있어요
00:33:58	 
		 
00:34:04	I apologize for my involvement.
		제가 끼어들어
		난처하게 만든 거 사과합니다
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:19	Matt and I were fighting. We broke up, you know.
		전 맷하고 싸웠어요
		헤어졌거든요
00:34:22	 
		And Sarah was drunk and dancing.
		 
		새라는 취해서
		춤 추고 있었고
00:34:25	 
		And she--she just tripped.
		 
		갑자기 걸려 넘어졌어요
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	And then she wasn't breathing.
		숨을 안 쉬더라구요
00:34:30	 
		Ok. Your mom's on her way.
		 
		엄마가 오는 중이셔
00:34:31	 
		And we called Sarah's parents.
		 
		새라 부모님도 연락했고
00:34:33	 
		It was an accident. It was a terrible, tragic accident.
		 
		사고였어
		정말 끔찍한 비극적 사고
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:37	Mom. The sheriff's here.
		엄마, 보안관님이 오셨어요
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:42	I'll go prepare her. Just don't leave.
		내가 준비하마
		가지 마렴
00:34:44	 
		Just stay here, ok?
		 
		여기 있어. 알았지?
00:34:46	 
		She's going to want to hear this story from you.
		 
		어떻게 된건지는
		너한테서 듣고 싶어하실 거야
00:34:48	 
		 
00:35:00	Matt's in the car, sleeping it off.
		맷은 차에서 자고 있어
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:03	I'll deal with him.
		내가 대면할게
00:35:04	 
		I don't want him involved in any of this.
		 
		맷이 이런데
		말려들길 원치 않아
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:08	What are you doing?
		뭐하는거야?
00:35:10	 
		 
00:35:11	I'm fixing a very bad situation.
		잘못된 상황을
		해결하는 중이지
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:15	Why? I did this.
		왜? 내가 한 일인데
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:18	I killed her.
		내가 죽였어
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	No, you didn't mean to.
		고의로 그런게 아니잖아
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:22	And I think it's best for everyone--
		내 생각에 모두들한테는..
00:35:24	 
		But she's dead.
		 
		죽었는걸
00:35:25	 
		 
00:35:26	You don't know what that means.
		그게 무슨 뜻인지 몰라서 그래
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:29	Actually, Tyler, I think I do.
		사실은 잘 알아
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:35	No, you don't, Caroline.
		아니, 넌 몰라
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:38	Has your wound healed?
		네 상처 낫앗니?
00:35:39	 
		 
00:35:53	How did you--
		어떻게..
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:58	Please, wait.
		기다려 봐
00:35:59	 
		 
00:36:01	Hey, I'm sorry about that spell.
		그 주문은 미안하다
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:03	Damn vampires.
		재수없는 뱀파이어들
00:36:04	 
		They pull you into the middle of it every time.
		 
		널 이 모든 일의 중간에 끌어들였군
00:36:06	 
		 
00:36:06	How do I know you?
		내가 어떻게 알죠?
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:08	When I gave you the stone,
		월장석을 줬을때
00:36:09	 
		How did I know I could trust you?
		 
		당신을 신뢰해도 되는지
		어떻게 알게 된거죠?
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:12	That feeling you got.
		네가 느낀 기운으로
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:15	You ever felt it before?
		전에도 느껴본 적 있나?
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:17	I mean, around family.
		우리 가족들 주변에서는요
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:20	My grams.
		우리 할머니
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:22	My mother is Johanna,
		우리 엄마 이름은 조아나야
00:36:24	 
		first cousin, twice removed from Pauline,
		 
		런던에서 두번 쫓겨난
		첫째 이모이자
00:36:26	 
		niece of Sheila a.k.a.--
		 
		쉴라의 조카딸
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	Grams?
		할머니가요?
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:31	We're related?
		우리 친척인건가요?
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:33	Yeah, we kinda are.
		그렇다고도 볼 수 있지
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:37	It's nice to meet you, Bonnie.
		만나서 반가웠다, 보니
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:40	Seeing you tonight was a wake up call for me.
		이렇게 널 만나고 나서
		정말 크게 깨달았다
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:44	I gotta stop letting vampires control me.
		뱀파이어가 조종하는 걸
		막아야할텐데
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:48	So thank you for that.
		그래서 고맙다
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:54	Please, don't leave.
		제발 가지 마세요
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	I have so many questions.
		질문이 너무 많은데
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:57	I don't wanna be in the middle either.
		나도 중간에 끼기 싫어요
00:36:59	 
		 
00:36:59	I hate it.
		정말 싫다구요
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:00	How do I stay out of it?
		어떻게 벗어나죠?
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:03	Unlike me, you're one of the good ones, Bonnie.
		나랑 달리 너는
		선한 편에 속했어, 보니
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:06	The middle of it is exactly where you need to be.
		바로 넌 그 중간에 서야만 하지
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:14	You take care, cos.
		잘 지내렴
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	Don't worry, you'll see me again.
		걱정마, 날 다시 볼테니
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:24	Yeah. I was gonna head home. Can I offer you a ride?
		집에 갈건데
		내가 태워줄까?
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:31	Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:37	When did you get your driver's license?
		언제 운전면허 땄니?
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:41	I'm not a kid anymore, Bonnie.
		난 이제 어린애 아냐
		보니 누나
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:44	I'd love a ride home.
		데려다주면 고맙지
00:37:47	 
		 
00:38:06	Elena.
		엘레나
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:10	I'm ok. I'm ok. Bonnie took away the pain,
		괜찮아
		보니가 고통을 죽였어
00:38:13	 
		and I think I'm healing.
		 
		회복하는 것 같아
00:38:14	 
		I know. But I think you should definitely see a doctor anyway.
		 
		알아. 하지만
		의사는 봐야하잖아
00:38:18	 
		I will.
		 
		그럴거야
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:21	I heard about Katherine.
		캐더린 얘기 들었어
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:23	Is it true? Is she really gone?
		사실이야?
		진짜 죽은거야?
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:26	Yep.
		그래
00:38:27	 
		 
00:38:29	I was so worried about you.
		정말 걱정됐어
00:38:30	 
		Stefan,
		 
		스테판
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:34	I...
		난..
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:42	Katherine being gone doesn't change anything for you, does it?
		캐더린이 죽어도
		변하는게 없구나?
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:46	I want to be with you, Stefan, you know that.
		너랑 함께 하고픈거
		너도 알잖아
00:38:48	 
		 
00:38:50	But first I need to wake up,
		하지만 난 깨어 나서
00:38:53	 
		and know that the people that I love are safe.
		 
		내가 사랑하는 자들이
		안전한걸 확인해야 해
00:38:55	 
		 
00:38:57	I need to feel safe.
		나도 안전하다 느껴야 하고
00:38:58	 
		 
00:39:01	Do you understand?
		이해되니?
00:39:02	 
		 
00:39:04	Yeah.
		응
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	Yeah. I--I understand.
		그래, 이해해
00:39:09	 
		 
00:40:11	Hello, Katherine.
		안녕, 캐더린
00:40:12	 
		 
00:40:13	Where am I?
		어디야?
00:40:14	 
		 
00:40:14	Where you should have been all along.
		네가 여태껏
		있어야 했던 장소
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:18	I thought you would have learned your lesson by now
		지금쯤 배웠을거라 생각했는데
00:40:19	 
		about messing with a Bennett witch.
		 
		베넷 마녀의
		성미 건드리는거
00:40:21	 
		 
00:40:22	You should have killed me.
		날 죽이지 그랬어
00:40:23	 
		Death would have been too kind.
		 
		죽이는 건
		너무 착한 방법이잖아
00:40:25	 
		 
00:40:27	No! Damon, don't.
		안 돼, 데이먼
		그러지 마
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:29	Damon, don't.
		데이먼, 제발
00:40:31	 
		You need me. Elena's in danger.
		 
		넌 내가 필요해
		엘레나는 위험해
00:40:32	 
		 
00:40:34	From who?
		누구 때문에?
00:40:35	 
		 
00:40:38	You're lying. You're always lying.
		거짓말하는군
		늘 그랬지
00:40:40	 
		 
00:40:41	Why do you think I haven't killed her?
		왜 내가 죽이지 않은 거 같아?
00:40:43	 
		 
00:40:44	She's the doppelganger. She needs to be protected.
		도플갱어야
		보호받아야 한다고
00:40:47	 
		 
00:40:49	Then I'll protect her.
		그럼 내가 보호해주지
00:40:50	 
		 
00:40:51	While you rot in hell.
		네가 지옥에서
		썩는 동안에
00:40:53	 
		No. Damon, don't.
		 
		안돼, 데이먼 그러지 마
00:40:55	 
		 
00:40:55	I'll do anything. Please, Damon.
		하라는 대로 다 할게
		제발, 데이먼
00:40:57	 
		You need me.
