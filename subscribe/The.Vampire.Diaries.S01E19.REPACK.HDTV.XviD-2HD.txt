00:00:00	previously on "the vampire diaries...
		지난 이야기.
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:02	" for over a century,I
		have lived in secret...
		한 세기를 걸쳐
		비밀을 간직한채 살았다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	Until now.
		여태까지
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	I know the risk,but I have to know her.
		위험한 건 알지만
		그녀를 알아야 한다
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	As a founding family member,
		설립자 가족의 일원으로써
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	I find it's my duty to report
		some very distressing news.
		끔찍한 소식을 전하는게
		제 임무라 느꼈습니다
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	He's a gilbert?
		길버트 가인가요?
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	Elena's uncle.
		엘레나의 삼촌이지
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	Mayor lockwood,is it?
		락우드 시장님이시라구요
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	- My name is pearl.
		- hi.
		- 펄입니다
		- 안녕하세요
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	This is my daughter anna.
		제 딸 애나구요
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	Maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
		뱀파이어라는게
		존재할 지도 몰라
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	They're just different from the
		way we always thought they were.
		우리가 늘 상상했던 것과
		다른 모습으로 말야
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:23	You got a problem with blood,anna?
		피를 두려워하니?
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:26	The coroner's office has officially ruled
		vicki donovan's death a drug overdose.
		검시관은 비키 도노반의 죽음을
		마약 과용사로 결론지었어요
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:31	- I don't think it was an overdose.
		- Jer,just let it go,ok?
		- 그래서 죽은거 같지 않아
		- 제레미 그만 잊어
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	Is there something
		you're not telling me?
		나한테 말 안하는거 있어?
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:37	Take my wrist,you need more blood.
		내 손목을 물어
		피가 더 필요하니
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:40	I have this hunger inside
		of me that I've never...
		내면의 배고픔이 느껴져
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	I've never felt before
		in my entire life.
		내 평생 처음이야
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:45	I don't want you to see me like this.
		내 이런 모습을
		보지 않길 원해
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	I don't want you to know
		that this side of me exists.
		이런 면이 존재한다는
		사실 자체도
00:00:51	 
		 
00:01:08	Nice car.
		차 멋진데
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:11	I thought it was a waste to
		leave it sitting in the garage.
		차고에만 썩혀두는게
		아깝다 싶어서
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:16	I didn't kno you were coming back today.
		오늘부터 다시
		학교에 나올줄 몰랐어
00:01:18	 
		 
00:01:19	You know,I woke up this
		morning and I was feeling great,
		아침에 일어났는데
		정말 기분이 좋더라고
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:23	and I figured it was time for
		me to get back into things.
		다시 원래대로
		돌아올 때다 싶었어
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	Does the mean you're ok now?
		괜찮은거야?
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:29	- With all the cravings?
		- Yeah.
		- 욕구도?
		- 그래
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	I mean,the worst part is over.
		끔찍했던 부분은 끝났어
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:33	So...
		그러니까
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:35	Now all I want to do is just spend
		as much time with you as possible.
		가능하면 많은 시간을
		너와 보내고 싶을 뿐야
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:39	I'm ok with that.
		그럼 좋지
00:01:41	 
		 
00:01:43	Hey,thank you.
		고마워
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:45	For helping me get through the...
		힘든 시간을
		견뎌내게 도와줘서
00:01:48	 
		힘든 시간을
		견뎌내게 도와줘서
00:01:48	The rough patch.
		힘든 시간을
		견뎌내게 도와줘서
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	You're welcome.
		천만에
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:53	We're going to be late.
		늦겠다
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	Ok,um,you know what,i'll catch up
		with you.I'm gonna grab my stuff.
		좀 있다가 보자
		챙길 게 좀 있어서
00:01:58	 
		 
00:01:58	I'll be right behind you.
		바로 따라갈게
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	- ok.
		- ok.
		알았어

		한글번역 박은희
		(twinkitty@lycos.co.kr)
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:24	There was a disturbance at the
		hospital blood bank last night.
		어젯밤 병원의 혈액고에
		소동이 생겼었네
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:27	Some of the supply was compromised.
		재고 일부가 사라졌어
00:02:29	 
		 
00:02:29	Compromised?You mean stolen.
		도난당했단 거겠죠
00:02:32	 
		 
00:02:32	We almost missed it.
		도난당한 사실을
		놓칠뻔 했지
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:33	The inventory records were altered,
		재고목록을 고쳐놨더군
00:02:35	 
		 
00:02:35	but when the night manager was questioned,he
		had no recollection of changing them.
		하지만 관리자를 심문해보니
		바꾼 기억이 없다는 거야
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	Meaning the vampire who stole the blood
		used mind control to hide the theft.
		그 뜻은 뱀파이어가 도난 사실을
		숨기기 위해 사람 마음을 조종한거군요
00:02:42	 
		 
00:02:43	- I know what she meant.
		- We wouldn't have noticed
		- 나도 뜻은 잘 알아요
		- 눈치 못챌뻔 했지
00:02:44	 
		 
00:02:44	if john not alerted us to recent discrepancies
		at other hospital blood banks in the county.
		존이 최근 우리 지역의 혈액은행의
		도난 사고에 대해 경고 안해줬다면
00:02:48	 
		 
00:02:48	How lucky for us,we have john.
		정말 행운이네요
		존이 있어서
00:02:51	 
		 
00:02:51	We're stepping up
		security at the hospital,
		병원 보안을 한층
		강화하기로 했네
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:53	giving the guards vervain to
		prevent this from happening again.
		이런 일을 예방하기 위해
		관리인들에게 마편초를 줬어
00:02:56	 
		 
00:02:56	Sheriff,might I offer a suggestion?
		보안관님 하나
		제안해도 될까요?
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	Why don't damon and I
		put our heads together?
		데이먼하고 제가
		합심하는게 어떨까요?
00:03:00	 
		 
00:03:00	We can track down whoever's doing this.
		이 짓을 하는게 누구든
		추적을 해보겠습니다
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	Truthfully,I could use the extra hands.
		솔직히 많이 도울수록 좋다네
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	Is that something
		you'd be willing to do?
		자네도 이 일을 하고 싶은가?
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	Well,of course,I mean,if it'll help.
		물론이죠, 도움만 된다면
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:09	I think we'll make a good team.
		환상의 팀이 될거 같아요
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	Don't you,damon?
		그렇지 않나요?
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	John,whatever I can do to
		help keep this town safe,
		존, 이 마을을 안전하게
		지키기 위해선 뭐든 할겁니다
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	even if it means spending time with you.
		당신과 같이 시간을 보내야 한대도
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:24	ok.
		좋아요
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	This week we're going to set aside our regular
		curriculum for a lesson in local history
		우리의 정규 커리큘럼을 제쳐두고
		지역 역사에 관한 강의를 하겠다
00:03:30	 
		 
00:03:30	as we approach founder's day.
		설립기념일도 가까워지고 하니
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:32	Apparently the community leaders feel
		that's more important than world war ii,
		알고보니 지역 지도자분들은
		세계 2차 대전보다 더 중요하다고 느끼셨더군
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	but hey,what do I know?
		내가 뭘 알겠어?
00:03:37	 
		 
00:03:37	Sorry I'm late.
		늦어서 죄송해요
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:39	Looks like we will be at full
		occupancy today.Welcome home,bonnie.
		오늘은 출석률은 백프로 같군
		돌아온 거 환영한다, 보니
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:43	Right,founder's day.
		설립기념일
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:45	What does it mean to
		have a founder's day?
		설립기념일의 의미가 무엇일까?
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	Well,if you'll turn your attention to
		 
00:03:49	 
		 
00:03:50	this exquisite diorama over
		here that I spent all night...
		 
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:57	I suppose I should be grateful
		you learned how to use the bell.
		벨 누르는 법을 배웠다니
		고마워해야 하는건가
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	I'm here on behalf of my mother.
		우리 어머니 때문에 온거야
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:01	On behalf of or in spite of?
		어머니를 위해서?
		아님 어머니를 무릅쓰고?
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:05	I'm sorry about what the
		other vampires did to stefan.
		다른 뱀파이어가
		스테판한테 했던 짓은 미안해
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:08	Abducting him,torturing him.
		납치해서 고문했던거
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:09	It wasn't supposed to go down like that.
		그렇게 만들
		의도는 없었는데
00:04:10	 
		 
00:04:11	You were playing house with half of
		a tomb of really pissed off vampires.
		무덤의 반을 데리고
		소꿉장난을 하니 열받으셨겠지
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:15	- What did you think was going to happen?
		- My mom is devastated.
		- 무슨 예상을 했어?
		- 엄마는 정말 충격받으셨어
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	They tried to overthrow her.
		그녀 계획을
		뒤집어 엎으려고 했지
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	Why isn't she here telling me this?
		왜 펄이 직접
		얘기 안하는거지?
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:21	She doesn't really do apologies.
		사과를 잘 못하셔
00:04:23	 
		 
00:04:23	Well,that's a coincidence,'cause I
		don'to forgiveness,so just run along.
		우연의 일치네
		나도 용서 잘 못하거든
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	And if you're going to continue playing
		house with your little vampire pets,
		뱀파이어 강아지들과
		계속 소꿉장난할 거면
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	you might want to stop robbing the
		blood bank dry,because they're onto it.
		병원 혈액 훔치는 짓 그만하셔
		이젠 들통났으니깐
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	I haven't been to the local
		blood bank in at least a week.
		난 이 지역 병원 안간지
		일주일도 넘었어
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	- Then it's one of your others.
		- The other ones are gone,damon.
		- 네 무리 중 하나겠군
		- 다들 사라졌거든, 데이먼
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Well,where'd they go?
		어디로 갔는데?
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:42	They weren't cut out for this town.
		마을을 위해
		떠나준게 아냐
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	After what happened with your brother,my
		mom kicked them out and they took off.
		네 동생한테 일이 생긴 후로
		엄마가 쫓아내서 떠났지
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	It's just us and harper now.
		이젠 우리랑 하퍼밖에 없어
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:51	Bonnie.
		뽀니
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:53	Hey,i,um,I tried to grab you after
		class but you'd already taken off.
		수업 끝나고 보려고 했는데
		벌써 나갔더라고
00:04:59	 
		 
00:04:59	How are you?
		어떻게 지냈어?
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	- How's your family?
		- We're dealing.It's been hard.
		- 가족들은 좀 어때?
		- 감당하기 좀 힘들었지
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:05	- Everyone here really missed you.
		- Yeah,
		- 모두들 널 그리워했어
		- 그래
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	I just had so much to deal
		with after grams' funeral,
		할머니 장례식 이후로
		해결할 일들이 많아서
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	and honestly after you told me
		that the tomb's spell failed,
		또 네가 무덤에 건 주문이
		실패했단 말 듣고 나서
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	I just didn't really want to come back.
		다시 돌아오고 싶지 않았어
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	I hope you understand why I called.
		내가 전화한 이유를
		이해했음 좋겠어
00:05:17	 
		 
00:05:17	I wanted you to know
		before you came home.
		집에 돌아오기 전에
		알았으면 했거든
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	Yeah,I understand why.I
		just wish I didn't know.
		그래, 왜인지 잘 알아
		몰랐길 바랄 뿐이지만
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:24	I know it's been really hard...
		힘들었던 거 아는데..
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	bonnie!Bonnie!
		보니!
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:28	Thank god you're home!
		돌아와서 다행이야
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	I know we talked every
		day,but I missed you!
		매일 전화했지만
		정말 보고 싶었다구!
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	How are you doing?
		좀 어떠니?
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	Better.Just better.You know,
		나아졌어
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	just glad to be back,and
		try to keep myself busy.
		돌아와서 기쁘지만
		바빠지려 노력중이야
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:38	Well,I can help with that.
		내가 도와줄게
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	Major wardrobe confab needed asap.
		당장 의상 조언이 필요해
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	You need to help me pick the perfect
		dress for the founder's court.
		창립자 건물 뜰에서 열리는
		행사를 위한 드레스 좀 골라줘
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:46	The founder's court?Did
		I miss something?
		창립자 건물 뜰?
		내가 빼먹은게 있나?
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:50	The founder's court.
		창립자 건물 뜰
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	You know,miss mystic falls.
		미스 미스틱폴즈 선발대회 말이야
00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:54	They announced it today,and,um,you
		and are both on it.
		오늘 발표했는데
		너랑 나 둘다 후보야
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	Oh,my god,we signed up
		for that so long ago.
		아, 그거 오래 전에
		신청했었지
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	- I completely forgot.
		- Yeah.
		- 완전 잊고있었네
		- 그래
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	So are you dropping out,then?
		참가 취소하게?
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:07	I can't.
		못하겠어
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:10	no?
		응?
00:06:11	 
		 
00:06:11	Her mom is the one who
		wanted her to enter.
		바로 엘레나 어머니가
		참가하라고 권유했었거든
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:22	How was school?
		학교는 어때?
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:24	Fine.
		좋아
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	Yeah?
		그래
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:27	Same old,same old?
		예전과 똑같던가?
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	Nothing new?
		새로운 건 없어?
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:30	No stories to bring home?
		가족에게 들려줄
		이야기도?
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:33	You're making small talk,why?
		갑자기 얘기를 하는 이유가?
00:06:35	 
		 
00:06:35	You seem awfully chipper lately.Less doom
		and gloom,a little more pep in your step.
		요즘 우울하지 않고 기운차 보여서
		도움 되게 얘기 좀 해보려고
00:06:39	 
		 
00:06:39	And you think it's because
		I drank human blood again.
		인간 피를 다시 마셔서
		이렇게 된거라 생각하시는거지
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	I mean,I don't want to brag,
		자랑하고 싶지 않지만
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	but I would definitely take responsibility
		for this new and improved you.
		새롭게 발전된 네 모습에
		기꺼이 책임을 지고 싶어
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:49	Right,right.Well,I hate to
		burst your bubble,but I'm clean.
		희망을 깨고 싶진 않지만
		이제 끊었어
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	Yeah,not possible.
		불가능해
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	Not only is it possible,but
		it is quite true.
		가능할뿐 아니라
		사실이기도 해
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	Stefan,let's be serious for a second.
		스테판, 조금 진지해져봐라
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	You spent the last century and a
		half being a poster child for prozac,
		지난 백오십년간 우울증약의
		대표 모델이었는데
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	and now you expect me to believe that this new
		you has nothing to do with human blood,nothing.
		이젠 새로운 모습이
		인간 피와 관련 없단걸 믿으라고
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:13	I'm clean.
		끊었어
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:15	You're lying!
		거짓말!
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:18	Believe what you want.
		원하는 대로 믿어
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:25	I'm sorry for the short notice.
		갑자기 알려준거 미안해
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	I didn't even know that the contest was
		coming up,much less that I would be in it.
		대회가 다가오는지 몰랐어
		내가 나가리라 기대도 못했고 말야
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	well,I'll be happy to
		escort you anywhere.
		기꺼이 어디든 모셔다 줄게
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	My mom was really into
		this founder's day stuff.
		엄마가 설립기념일 행사들을
		정말 좋아하셨거든
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	She was even miss mystic in her day.
		어머니도 한 때는
		미스 미스틱이셨으니까
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	I kinda wanted to do it for her.
		엄마를 위해 하고 싶어
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:40	Well,it'll be great.We'll have fun.
		잘됐다. 즐거울거야
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:43	Ok.
		알았어
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:44	I'll see tomorrow.I love you.
		내일 봐. 사랑해
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	Love you,too.
		나도
00:07:47	 
		 
00:08:14	well,well.
		이런
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	He's a liar and a thief.
		거짓말쟁이에다가 도둑놈이군
00:08:18	 
		 
00:08:26	So...When were you going to share?
		언제 나누려고 했지?
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:31	Go ahead.
		이리와
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:32	- Help yourself.
		- No,no,
		- 하나 집어
		- 아니
00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	I'm talking about the fact
		that you're a closet blood nknk.
		혈액은행의 피를 훔치는걸
		숨겨왔단 사실 말야
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	So I'm drinking blood again.
		그래 난 다시 인간 피를 마시지
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	You're the one that shoved
		it on me.What's your problem?
		강요했던건 형이잖아
		문제 있어?
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:42	I have it under control.
		다 처리해놨어
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	Under control?
		다 처리해놨다고?
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	You robbed the hospital.
		병원을 털었잖아
00:08:47	 
		 
00:08:47	So what's your point?
		하고 싶은 말이 뭔데?
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	Fine.
		좋아
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	Whatever,man.Drink up.
		아무렴 마셔보지
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	Just remember we're trying
		to keep a low profile.
		하지만 우리는 정체를
		숨기려 조심중이잖아
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:54	Why don't you just walk up to
		sheriff forbes,ask her to tap a vein.
		보안관님한테 직접 가서
		정맥 좀 물어도 되냐고 하지 그래?
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	Have my actions negatively impacted you?
		내 행동이 부정적인
		영향을 끼쳤나?
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:01	I can't imagine what
		that must feel like.
		그 심정이 어떤지
		상상이 안되는군
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	Yeah,what's elena think
		about the new...You?
		엘레나는 새로운.. 널
		어떻게 생각할까?
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:07	Noing's changed.I'm
		still the same person.
		변한거 없어
		똑같은 사람이니까
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	- Clearly.
		- Elena doesn't need to know anything yet.
		- 정말 그래 보이네
		- 엘레나는 아직 알 필요 없어
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:14	You've been off the human
		stuff for years,stefan.
		넌 몇십년간 인간피를 멀리했었어
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	- If you're having trouble controlling...
		- I'm not having any trouble.
		- 자제력에 문제가 있다면
		- 아무 문제 없어
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	Who do you think you're talking to?
		내가 누군줄 알고 그래?
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	I know what it's like.
		그 심정 알아
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	That jekyll and hyde feeling.
		이중 인격자가 된 느낌
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:24	There's that switch,sometimes
		it goes off and you snap.
		스위치가 있는데
		가끔 꺼지면 이성을 잃지
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Right now is not a good time for
		me to be worried about you snapping.
		지금 네가 이성을 잃는 걸
		걱정할 수 만도 없다고
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	I know that it pains you to see this.
		내 이런 모습을 보는게
		고통스러운 거 알아
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:34	But I'm fine,ok?
		하지만 괜찮다구
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	I'm fine.
		괜찮아
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	So please,do me a favor.
		그러니까 부탁 좀 들어줘
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:43	And back off.
		좀 비켜달라구
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:50	This year's queen will have the
		special honor of taking center stage
		올해의 여왕은
		설립기념일 축제때
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	at the 150th founder's day gala.
		무대에 나서는
		영광을 갖게 되죠
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	Before we crown our winner,we'd like to
		get to know a bit more about each of you.
		우승자에게 왕관을 씌우기 전에
		여러분들을 더 잘 알고 싶어요
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:01	I'm on the m.f.Beautification committee.
		전 미용 위원회에 있고
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	- I volunteer at the rec center soup kitchen.
		- I recognize that
		- 휴양센터 부엌에서 봉사활동을 하죠
		- 요즘 깨달았는데
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	I haven't been as involved
		this year as I used to be.
		예전처럼 교내 활동에
		많이 참여하지 못했어요
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	I implemented this year's
		go green campaign at school.
		이번해 환경보호 캠페인을
		이행했구요
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:11	I've been distracted,and I
		let a lot of things slide.
		요즘 마음이 산란해져서
		많은 걸 내버려뒀었죠
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	I don't think it's wrong for
		me to win 2 years in a row.
		2년 연속으로 선발되는건
		잘못된게 없다 생각해요
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:16	I was surprised to have been selected.
		후보로 뽑혔단 사실에 놀랐어요
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:18	- Since I'm not from one of the founding families.
		- But I'm aware of what an honor this is,
		- 설립자 가족 일원이 아니니까요
		- 하지만 이 행사의 명성을 잘 압니다
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	and I want you to know
		that I take it seriously.
		진지하게 받아들인다는 거
		알아주셨으면 좋겠어요
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	Worked with the county's
		recycling program
		이 지역의 재활용
		프로그램에도 참여했고
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	and was in charge of the
		policemen's yearly raffle.
		경찰서에서 마련했던
		복권 판매 일도 맡았죠
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	Just because my dul made my
		community service mandatory,
		음주운전 때문에
		지역봉사를 의무적으로 했지만
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	- doesn't mean I was any less committed.
		- This was really important to my mother.
		- 적극적으로 일했습니다
		- 어머니한테 중요한 일이죠
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	She believed in
		community,family,honor and loyalty.
		공동체와 가족과
		명예와 충의를 믿으셨거든요
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:40	It's the legacy she ft for me.
		어머니가 저에게
		남긴 유산이죠
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:46	- Hey,partner.
		- What do you want?
		- 파트너씨
		- 원하는게 뭐지?
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	You haven't returned any of my calls.
		내 전화를 안 받더군
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:51	Most people take that as a hint.
		다른 사람들이라면
		눈치를 챌텐데
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	Why don't we start looking for vampires?
		뱀파이어 찾는건 언제 시작할거지?
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:56	Why the act,john?I mean,you obviously
		don't care about catching vampires.
		왜 이래? 뱀파이어 잡는데
		신경 안쓰는게 확실한데
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	You're here talking to me.
		여기 와서
		나랑 얘기하는걸 보면
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	Actually,I care very much.
		사실 정말 신경 많이 써
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	What did isobel say about that?I
		mean,considering that she is one.
		이자벨이 뭐라든?
		당신의 운명이었으니
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	Isobel and I share a mutual interest.
		우리는 공통 관심사가 있었어
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	The original johnathan gilbert had an
		invention that was stolen by a vampire.
		1세대 조나단 길버트의 발명품이
		뱀파이어한테 도난당했었지
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	That vampire was then burned alive in
		fell's church,or so johnathan thought.
		그 뱀파이어는 교회에서
		산채로 불에 타 죽었다 생각했어
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	And the invention was lost forever.
		발명품은 영원히
		사라졌을줄 알았고
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	But then the vampires
		weren't killed,were they?
		하지만 뱀파이어들은
		죽지 않았지?
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:24	They were trapped.
		갇혀 있었지
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	And now they're free,thanks to you,which
		means the invention is retrievable.
		당신 덕에 이제 해방이 됐어
		그 물건을 되찾을수 있단 뜻이지
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	Well,what is it?
		그 물건이 뭔데?
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	The only thing that matters
		is that I want it back,
		제일 중요한건
		내가 되찾고 싶단 거야
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	and you're going to help me
		if you want your secret safe.
		네 비밀을 지키고 싶다면
		날 도와줘야 하고
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	I mean,why bring me into it,john?
		왜 날 끌어들이는거지, 존?
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	I mean,I don't even know what you're
		talking about,much less who has it.
		누가 가졌는지도 모르거니와
		무슨 말하는지 모르겠거든
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	Oh,come on,damon.
		왜 이러셔, 데이먼
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:43	You were around back then.
		그 시절에도
		살아 있었잖나
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	Yoknow who these people
		are,what they look like.
		그 인간들이 누군지
		어떻게 생겼는지도 알고
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:48	He was friendly with a woman
		who turned out to be a vampire.
		알고보니 조나단은
		뱀파이어인 여자와 친하게 지냈지
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:51	Her name was pearl.
		이름은 펄이었네
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Does that ring a bell?
		익숙한 이름인가?
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:59	I'm not playing anymore.
		이젠 게임은 안해
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:02	Get out.Get out.
		어서 나가
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	- I beg your pardon?
		- You know,
		뭐라고?
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:07	I only entertain this whole
		blackmail scheme thing of yours
		이런 협박같은 당신의
		책략에 응했던 이유는
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:10	because I thought that you and
		isobel could lead me to katherine.
		당신과 이자벨이 내가 캐더린을
		찾도록 이끌어줄거라 생각해서였어
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	But see,now I know you have
		no idea where katherine is,
		캐더린이 어디 있는지
		전혀 모르는게 확실해
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	because if you did,you would know that
		katherine and pearl were best friends.
		알았다면 캐더린과 펄이
		단짝 친구였단 사실을 알았을거거든
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:22	See,you don't know
		everything,do you,john?
		다 알지는 못하군, 존?
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:28	- I'll tell the entire council what you are.
		- Go for it.
		- 의회에 정체를 불어버릴거야
		- 그러셔
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	I'll kill every last one of them.
		남김없이 다 죽여버릴테니
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	Then I'll sever your hand,pull
		your ring off,and I'll kill you,too.
		네 손가락을 잘라
		반지를 빼고 죽일테니까
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:37	Do you understand that?
		알겠어?
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:41	Honor your partner.
		파트너에게 인사하세요
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:47	Let's focus.
		집중해요
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:49	Right hand around.
		오른쪽 손을 대고 도세요
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:53	Flirt with your eyes.
		눈으로 유혹하면서
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:59	Left hand around.
		왼쪽으로
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:07	- This is ridiculous.
		- Both hands.
		- 웃긴다
		- 두 손 모두 올리고
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	You're only saying that because
		you don't know how to do it.
		춤추는 방법을 몰라서
		그러는거지
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:12	Sorry only one of us was around
		when the dance was invented.
		이 춤이 발명되던 시대에
		태어나지 못해서 미안해
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:16	Oh,no,no,no,no.
		안돼요
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	There's no touching during this part.
		파트너와 닿으면 안되요
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	It's about the simple
		intimacy of the near-touch.
		닿을듯 말듯한
		친밀감이 중요하죠
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	Very nice,amber.
		아주 잘했어요, 앰버
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	Thank you,mrs.Lockwood!
		감사합니다
		락우드 여사님
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	If you ask me,the near
		touch is overrated.
		닿을듯 말듯한 건
		참 과대 평가 됐어
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:32	You seem to be in a good mood.
		정말 기분이 좋나봐
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	Is that a bad thing?
		안좋은건가?
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	Would you prefer me to
		be brooding and tortured?
		침울하게 고뇌하는
		내 모습이 더 좋아?
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Hey,I'm not complaining.
		불평하는 게 아니잖아
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	Oh,no touching.
		닿으면 안돼
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:43	the fell cousins don't have a shot.
		펠 자매들은
		전혀 가능성이 없어
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	And amber bradley is only on the court
		게다가 앰버 브래들리가
		후보로 뽑힌 건
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	so the pageant doesn't look
		like it's founding families only.
		설립자 가족들만 대표로 선발하는게
		아닌것처럼 보이려는 거지
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	Which,of course,it is.
		물론 맞지만 말야
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	So that leaves elena.
		그럼 엘레나만 남지
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	She totally has the sympathy
		vote since her parents died.
		부모님이 돌아가시고
		동정표를 많이 얻었어
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	How can I compete with that?
		어떻게 이길수 있겠어?
00:13:57	 
		 
00:13:58	Very nice.
		아주 착하네
00:13:59	 
		 
00:13:59	- Very sensitive.
		- Oh,I'm sorry.
		- 걱정도 해주고
		- 미안해
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	This must sound really
		unimportant in light of everything.
		다른 모든 면에서 볼 때
		정말 하찮은 일처럼 들리겠지만
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	It's ok.I get it.
		괜찮아. 이해해
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	You want to win.
		이기고 싶은거지
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	Well,my grandmother was miss mystic.
		우리 할머니가
		미스 미스틱이셨어
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	And both of my aunts.
		우리 이모 두분도
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	My mom's the only one who didn't
		get the gene,and I want this.
		우리 엄마는 그런 유전자를
		물려받지 못했지만, 난 되고 싶어
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:15	I mean,I actually deserve this.
		선발될 가치도 있다고
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:25	Bonnie.
		보니
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	hey.
		안녕
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	hey.How are you?
		어떻게 지냈어?
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:34	I begged bonnie to fill in for matt.
		보니한테 맷 대신
		와달라고 했어
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	He had to work today.
		오늘 일하거든
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:41	Bonnie,do you have a minute?
		보니, 잠깐 시간 있니?
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:44	- We only have 30 minutes for rehearsal.
		- It'll only take a minute.Please?
		- 리허설은 30분만이야
		- 몇 분 안 걸릴거야, 응?
00:14:50	 
		 
00:15:03	Bonnie,you have to tell me what's wrong.
		보니, 뭐가 잘못된건지 말해줘
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	It's not worth talking about.
		말할 가치도 없는 거야
00:15:07	 
		 
00:15:08	What do you mean,not worth it?
		가치가 없다니
		무슨 말이야?
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	You've barely said 10 words to
		me,and you won't even look at stefan.
		나한테 열마디도 안 말하고
		스테판은 쳐다보지도 않고
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:16	Is that what it is,is it stefan?
		그것 때문이니?
		스테판?
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:22	Listen.
		들어봐
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	Elena,I can't just pretend
		like everything is ok.
		엘레나, 난 모든게
		괜찮은 척 할 수 없어
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	Everything my grams did was to protect
		us from those vampires in the tomb.
		우리 할머니가 했던 건 무덤에 있는
		뱀파이어들을 막아내려는 거였어
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	And now they're out,which
		means she died for nothing.
		이제 무덤 밖으로 나와 버렸으니
		아무 의미 없이 돌아가셨단 거지
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:39	I'm so sorry,bonnie.
		정말 유감이야, 보니
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:43	What can I do to make it better?
		어떻게 해야
		해결할 수 있을까?
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	That's just it.
		그게 끝이야
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	There's nothing you can do.
		달리 할 방법이 없어
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:49	I blame him,elena.
		스테판을 저주했어, 엘레나
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	Him and damon.
		스테판하고 데이먼을
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	And I'm not going to put you in a
		situation where you have to choose sides.
		한쪽 편을 택해야 하는
		그런 상황은 만들지 않을거야
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:58	I'm just having a hard time with it.ok?
		그냥 힘들 뿐이야, 응?
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:19	Dude,are you ok?
		괜찮니?
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	You're bleeding.
		피가 나잖아
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:31	Ahh,stefan!
		스테판!
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:35	- Are you ok?
		- Yes.
		- 괜찮아?
		- 네
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	I'm sorry.
		미안해요
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	I was just..
		그저..
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:42	I was feeling a little sick.
		몸이 좀 안좋아서
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:44	I'll be fine.
		괜찮을거에요
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:59	- I heard you're driving.
		- Yeah,I am.
		- 데려다주신다면서요
		- 그래
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	Let me get that for you.
		내가 들어줄게
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	- Thanks.
		- Yeah.
		- 고마워요
		- 그래
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	Um,how,uh...
		그럼..
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	How is stefan?
		스테판은 좀 어떠니?
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:10	What do you mean?
		무슨 말씀이죠?
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	You know,he seems on edge.
		신경이 날카로운 거 같던데
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:14	He went through a lot,he
		was in bad shape for a while.
		많은 일을 겪은 후라
		상태가 안 좋아요
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	But he's bouncing back now.
		이젠 회복 중이에요
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:20	Alaric.
		알라릭
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	Hey,buddy.What are you doing here?
		안녕하세요
		여긴 왠일이죠?
00:17:24	 
		 
00:17:24	Well,I'm the chauffer.
		운전사가 되주기로 했거든요
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	Oh,I thought I was driving.
		내가 운전하는 건줄 알았는데
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:29	Oh,no need.We're going with rick.
		필요 없어
		릭하고 같이 갈거야
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:33	Are we ready?
		준비 됐지?
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	Jeremy can ride with you.
		제레미 태우고 가든가
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:58	In the running for miss mystic falls?
		미스 미스틱 폴즈 후보로
		참가하는 건가?
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	Somememis you have to wear
		uncomfortable heels to blend in.
		조화되기 위해서는 가끔씩
		불편한 힐도 신어야 하지
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:06	I remember this event from 1864.
		1864년때 이 행사가 기억나
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	I was supposed to enter,before
		everything happened.
		참가하려고 했는데
		큰일이 일어나 버렸지
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:14	Ahh,nostalgia's a bitch.
		추억이란 참 엿같지
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:17	If you're just going to mock
		me,then you move along,please.
		계속 날 놀릴거면
		그냥 비켜주지 않을래?
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	John gilbert thinks your mom stole an
		artifact from johnathan sr.Sr.Back in 1864.
		존 길버트는 너희 엄마가 1864년도에
		조나단한테 물건을 훔쳤다 생각해
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	What are you,his errand boy?
		그 인간 심부름꾼이라도 된거야?
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	I don't know what it is,but
		I don't want him to have it.
		그게 뭔진 모르지만
		그의 손에 넘어가지 않길 원해
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	I could ask her.
		내가 엄마한테 물어볼게
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	But,you know,you've made it pretty clear that
		you don't trust us,so why should I even bother?
		하지만 우릴 믿지 않다는 걸 확실히
		보여줬으니 내가 왜 신경써야 하지?
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:39	Because you want to stay in mystic falls,and
		john gilbert's in town,making that impossible.
		미스틱 폴즈에서 지내고 싶어하지
		존 길버트가 돌아온 이상 불편해졌어
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:43	Find out where it is.
		그 물건이 어디 있는지 찾아내
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	He leaves,you can buy a welcome mat.
		그가 떠나고 나서 기뻐하라구
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:52	Thanks for helping me.
		도와줘서 고마워
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	Don't thank me until you're sure
		your hair isn't going to burn off.
		머리카락 태울수도 있으니까
		날 조심히 봐야 할걸
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:59	You know,I remember when my mom
		and I were first applying for this.
		엄마랑 내가 처음에
		지원했을 때가 기억난다
00:19:03	 
		 
00:19:03	She was so excited.
		정말 기뻐하셨는데
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	So were you,if I recall.
		내 기억엔
		너도 기뻐했었지
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	I was.
		맞아
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	She just made it sound like so much fun.
		정말 재미있는 대회인것처럼
		말씀해주셨거든
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	Lots has changed since then.
		그 후로 많은게 변했지
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:14	Well,I hate to break it to you,but
		it's a little late for cold feet.
		솔직히 이런 말 하긴 싫지만
		생각을 바꾸기엔 너무 늦었어
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	I don't have cold feet.I just...
		생각 바꾼게 아니라..
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:20	I think I'd be enjoying it
		a lot more if she was here.
		엄마가 살아 계셨다면
		더 즐거웠을 것 같아서
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:26	I'll tell you one thing,your hair
		would have a better chance if she was.
		확실한건, 그녀가 있었다면
		네 머리가 더 예쁘게 됐었겠지
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:33	Ok,I should go put my dress on.
		가서 드레스 입어야 겠다
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	Be careful with that thing.
		그건 조심해
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:38	Don't hurt anybody.
		사람 다치게 만들지 말고
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:45	You look miserable.
		우울해보이는군
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:47	Are there really a whole month of these
		events that I'm supposed to show up at?
		제가 참석해야 할 이벤트가
		한달씩이나 더 있다구요?
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	You can fight it if you want,but
		it's part of being a gilbert.
		원하면 불참해도 돼
		하지만 길버트가의 역할이지
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	Yeah,you,uh,you mentioned you
		know a lot about the family.
		길버트 가문에 대해
		잘 아신다고 하셨죠
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	Do you know anything about
		our ancestor johnathan gilbert?
		조상 조나단 길버트씨에 대해
		아시는 거 있으세요?
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	Prolific writer,crazy inventor.
		다작 작가였고
		정신 나간 발명가였지
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	Why do you ask?
		왜 묻는거지?
00:20:06	 
		 
00:20:06	Well,I read his journal.
		일기장을 읽었거든요
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:08	Is that right?
		그래?
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:10	Yeah.I actually found
		it in all dad's stuff.
		아버지 유품을 뒤지다가
		발견했어요
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:14	Well,that's surprising.
		놀라운데
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	Most of them are locked away.
		대부분은 숨겨놨으니까
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:18	- There's more of them?
		- Johnathan gilbert journaled his whole life.
		- 일기장이 더 있다는 말씀인가요?
		- 조나단 길버트씨는 평생을 기록했어
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	Right down to the
		bitter,insane drunken end.
		술취해 안타까운
		결말을 맞은 것까지도
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:24	Guy had a lot of demons.
		귀신에 시달리셨었지
00:20:25	 
		 
00:20:25	And did you read 'em?
		읽어보셨나요?
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	I browsed,yeah.
		그래
00:20:28	 
		 
00:20:28	What'd you think about what he wrote?
		그가 쓰신 일기를 보고
		어떤 생각이 드셨나요?
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:31	Crazy ramblings of a mad man,of course.
		물론 정신나간 노인의
		정신나간 주절거림이라고
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:36	Yeah.
		네
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:42	Well,she's very pretty.
		예쁜 아이군
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	Yeah,yeah,she's a,uh,a friend of mine.
		제 친구에요
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	Excuse me.
		실례할게요
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:59	Are you ok,amber?
		괜찮아, 앰버?
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	I hate being the center of attention.
		사람들의 관심이 쏠리는게 싫거든
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:04	I get panic attacks.
		가끔 공황발작을 해
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	Do you need some privacy
		so you can change?
		갈아입게 좀 비켜줄까?
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	Actually,I'm just...I'm just
		going to go get some air.
		아니.. 그냥
		바람 좀 쐬러 갈게
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:18	hey.
		데이먼
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:20	You can't be back here.
		여기 오면 안되요
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:21	We need to talk.
		얘기 좀 해야겠다
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	Does it have to be right now?
		지금 당장 해야하나요?
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:26	Normally I would have a
		completely different outlook on
		보통 난 내가 할 말에
		다른 견해를 가졌었지만
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	what I'm about to tell you,but since it
		could really inconvenience me,i'll squeal.
		나한테 불편한 일이니
		일러바치겠어
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	What are you talking about?
		무슨 말씀이죠?
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:37	Stefan's still drinking human blood.
		스테판은 아직도
		인간 피를 마시고 있어
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:41	- What?
		- Yeah.
		- 뭐라구요?
		- 그래
00:21:43	 
		 
00:21:44	A month ago,I would have rejoiced.
		한 달 전이라면
		기뻐했을거야
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:47	But with the council back on the alert,it is
		not a good time for stefan to fly off the handle.
		하지만 의회가 경계모드로 돌입했으니
		스테판이 냉정을 잃기 좋은 때가 아니지
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:51	I know he's been a little
		edgy,but he said that was normal.
		약간 예민했지만
		정상적인 거랬어요
00:21:54	 
		 
00:21:54	He has a fridge full of stolen
		blood bank contraband in the house.
		스테판의 냉장고가
		병원에서 훔친 혈액으로 가득해
00:21:59	 
		 
00:22:01	Oh,my god.
		세상에
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	He has no idea what normal is.
		스테판은 정상이란 어떤건지 몰라
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	His entire existence isn't normal.
		그의 생활방식 자체가
		정상이 아녔지
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	Normal to a vampire is
		drinking human blood.
		뱀파이어에게 정상이란
		인간 피를 마시는 거야
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:10	But he spent all this time fighting it when
		he should have been learning how to ctrtrol it.
		자제하는 법을 배워야 할 시간에
		늘 맞서싸우기만 했지
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:14	And now it's controlling him instead.
		이젠 조종을 당하고 있어
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	I can't believe this.I mean,it's
		stefan that we're talking about here.
		믿을 수 없어요. 우린
		스테판 말하는 거잖아요
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	Stefan on human blood,elena.
		인간 피를 마신
		스테판 말이지
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	He'll do anything,he'll say anything,because
		he's not going to want to stop.
		뭐든지 하고, 무슨 말이든 할거야
		자신을 막는건 가만두지 않을테니
00:22:26	 
		 
00:22:27	Trust me.
		믿어봐
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:31	Anna!
		애나!
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:33	What is it?
		무슨 일이야?
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:36	Come on,don't be like that.
		그러지 마
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	Why not?
		왜?
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:40	You're basically using me to turn you into
		a vampire so you could be with someone else.
		넌 다른 여자와 함께하기 위해서
		날 이용해 뱀파이어가 되려 했잖아
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:44	No,I wasn't using you.
		널 이용한게 아녔어
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	Really?
		정말?
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:47	Then how would you like to define it?
		그럼 어떻게 설명할건데?
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	Look,I don't think it's any worse
		than becoming friends with me
		나랑 친구가 되서
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	so you could give your mother my blood.
		네 엄마한테 내 피를
		주는건 나쁘진 않을텐데
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:55	How do you know that?
		어떻게 알았어?
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	That's not important.
		중요치 않아
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	Seriously,jeremy.
		진짜, 제레미
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	What do you know?
		뭘 알고 있니?
00:23:02	 
		 
00:23:02	Everything.
		모든걸
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	I know everything.
		다 알아
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:08	This is all my fault.I'm the one who
		fed him the blood in the first place.
		다 내 잘못이에요
		애초에 피를 먹인게 나였으니
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:17	What's going on in here?
		무슨 일이야?
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	Just filling elena in on your
		extracurricular activities.
		엘레나에게 네
		비정상적 행동을 말해주고 있지
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:28	What are you talking about?
		무슨 말이야?
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:30	I know about the blood,stefan.
		피에 관한 얘기 들었어
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	I'm gonna..I'll be downstairs,drinking.
		난.. 아래층에 가서
		술 좀 마셔야 겠다
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:48	I was going to tell you.
		얘기하려고 했어
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:50	When?
		언제?
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:52	I'm fine.
		난 괜찮아
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	I'm fine.The blood,it
		doesn't change anything.
		괜찮다구, 피 때문에
		바뀐거 하나도 없어
00:23:57	 
		 
00:23:58	It's changing you.
		변하고 있잖아
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:00	Why,because I kept it a secret from you?
		왜, 너한테 숨겼던 거 때문에?

		데이먼 때문이 아니잖아
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:21	It's about what's happening to you.
		너한테 일어나는 변화 때문이야
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:22	I know,and I'm telling
		you that I'm fine.
		괜찮다고 말하잖아
00:24:24

00:36:42

		엄마 이름이 펄이라고?
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:51	Yes,so?
		그래
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:54	Well,I believe I already
		know all about her.
		벌써 다 아는 사이 같네
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:59	Oh,good,there you are.Jenna
		wanted me to get the car.
		다행이 여기 있었네
		너희 이모가 차 태워달래
00:37:02	 
		 
00:37:03	What happened?
		무슨 일이니?
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:11	All right,now this is getting weird.
		이상해져가는군
00:37:12	 
		 
00:37:12	We're here to talk.
		얘기 좀 해
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:17	I'm not in the mood.Today's
		been a no-good,very bad day.
		그럴 기분이 아냐
		오늘은 운없는 날이었거든
00:37:20	 
		 
00:37:20	Annabelle tells me you're looking for
		something I took from johnathan gilbert.
		애나벨이 그러길 조나단한테서
		빼앗아간 물건을 찾고 있다면서
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:24	I'm listening.
		듣고 있어요
00:37:26	 
		 
00:37:30	What is that?
		이게 뭐죠?
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	Johnathan was passionate
		about his inventions.
		조나단은 자신의 발명품에
		열정을 가졌었지
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:33	He confided in me that
		나한테 털어놨어
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:35	he had created a detection device meant
		to track down the town's vampire element.
		뱀파이어를 추적할 수 있는
		탐지 장치를 개발했다고
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:40	It was a pocket watch.
		주머니 시계가요
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:41	That's what it turned out to be,yes.
		알고 보니 그랬지
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:43	But that's not what I stole.
		하지만 내가 훔친건
		그게 아녔어
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:45	I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch
		in johnathan's hand the night they took us.
		조나단이 우리를 잡아간 날 밤
		들고 있던 시계를 보고 내 실수를 깨달았지
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:51	Its dial pointed at me.
		눈금이 날 향했거든
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:56	- So what is this?
		- I have no idea.
		- 그럼 이건 뭐죠?
		- 나도 전혀 모르겠어
00:37:58	 
		 
00:37:58	But now it's yours.
		하지만 이젠 자네꺼야
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:01	What's the catch?
		무슨 속셈이죠?
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	There's no catch.
		속셈은 없네
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:04	My daughter wants to stay here.
		내 딸은 여기 살고 싶어해
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:08	I want to stay here.
		나도 이 마을에
		살고 싶고
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	You refuse to trust
		us,and for good reason.
		우릴 믿길 거부한다면
		좋은 이유로
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	Consider this an apology.
		사과라고 생각하게
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:36	You shouldn't be here.
		여기 있어선 안돼
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:39	I know.
		알아
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:46	Now you know.
		이제 아는군
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:48	That wasn't you.
		그건 네가 아녔어
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:50	Oh,it was absolutely me.
		아니, 내가 맞아
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:52	I'a monster predator.It's
		who I am,elena.
		난 괴물이자 약탈자야
		바로 그런 존재지
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:56	That's what the blood makes you.
		피 때문에
		그렇게 된거야
00:38:57	 
		 
00:38:57	The blood brings out what's inside of me.
		The blood brings out what's inside of me.
		피는 내 본모습을 이끌어낸거야
00:38:59	 
		 
00:38:59	And if you think any
		differently, then you're an idiot.
		다르게 생각했다면
		넌 바보야
00:39:02	 
		 
00:39:03	I know this isn't you,Stefan.
		네가 아닌거 알아
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:05	I wanted to drain
		난 마시고 싶었어
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	Every ounce of blood
		from that girl's body.
		그 여자의 몸에서
		모든 피를 빨아내고 싶었지
00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:11	- No.
		- It's who I am,Elena.
		- 아니
		- 난 바로 그런 존재야
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:14	No. You can't scare me off.
		아니, 난 두려워하지 않아
00:39:16	 
		 
00:39:17	Why would you risk it?Why
		would you come here?
		왜 위험을 무릅쓰니?
		왜 여기에 온거야?
00:39:19	 
		 
00:39:19	Because I did this.
		내가 이렇게 만들었으니까
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	This is my fault.
		내 잘못이야
00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:22	I'm the one who made
		you drink the blood.
		네가 인간 피를 마시게
		만든 사람은 바로 나지
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	All you did was expose
		me to who I really am.
		네가 한 거라곤
		내 본모습을 노출시킨 것 뿐야
00:39:26	 
		 
00:39:26	- This isn't you.
		- Stop saying that!
		- 너답지 않아
		- 그건 그만 말해!
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:33	Don't get any closer to me.
		나한테 가까이 다가오지 마
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	- I'm not going to let this happen to you.
		- Stop.

		- 그만해

		to give up on you.******
		스테판, 난 널
		포기 안할거야
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:40	Stop!
		그만하라구!
00:39:41	 
		 
00:39:41	Stop!
		멈춰!
00:39:43

00:40:46	I'm sure.
		확실해요
00:40:47	 
		 
00:40:55	There's no guarantee

		보장은 못해
00:40:57	 
		 
00:40:58	It has to.
		효과가 있어야만 해요
00:40:59
