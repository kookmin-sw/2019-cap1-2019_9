00:00:10	Hey.
		안녕.
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	Hey, boss. I got your text.
		What's up?
		반장님, 문자 받았어요. 무슨 일이세요?
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	I got a call from the FBI.
		FBI에서 전화가 왔어.
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	What do they want?
		뭐래요?
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	It's about the investigation
		of Craig O'Laughlin's death.
		크레이그 오러플린 일이야.
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:23	It was an agent named wexler.
		자기 이름이 wexler 요원이라던데.
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	He said he'd been
		trying to reach you.
		너한테 연락하려다 안됐대. 
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	Yeah, he left some messages.
		그 사람 문자 저도 봤어요.
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	I haven't had a chance to call him back.
		What did he say?
		바빠서 아직 전화를 못했죠. 뭐래요?
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	The investigation's over.
		They've filed the report.
		수사는 끝났고 보고서 올라갔대. 
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:34	He just wanted you to know that
		he was returning your necklace.
		목걸이 보냈다고 알려주려고 연락했다고.
00:00:37	 
		 
00:00:37	My what?
		뭐요?
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	The necklace
		O'Laughlin gave you.
		오러플린이 너한테 준 목걸이. 
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	It was in evidence, but
		they're done with it.
		증거였지만 이제 다 끝났으니까.
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	He sent it over.
		보낸다더라.
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:44	I don't...
		전... 
00:00:45	 
		 
00:00:46	Look, I don't want it.
		You take it.
		저 필요 없어요. 그냥 가져 가세요.
00:00:48	 
		 
00:00:48	If you don't want it,
		you can sell it,
		이제 필요 없으면 팔아도 되고, 
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	or you could take it down
		to the evidence room,
		아니면 증거물 보관소에 놔두면 
00:00:52	 
		 
00:00:52	and they can auction it off.
		거기서 나중에 경매에 붙일거야.
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:57	Here. That's for you.
		널 위한거야.
00:00:58	 
		 
00:01:04	Hey, boss. Caught one.
		반장님, 사건입니다. 
00:01:07	 
		 
00:01:07	Shooting victim out in
		El Oro State Forest.
		El Oro 주립공원에서 피살자입니다.
00:01:09	 
		 
00:01:09	You two take it.
		둘이 가서 봐.
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:11	Grace? Are you okay?
		그레이스? 괜찮아?
00:01:13	 
		 
00:01:13	Fine, yeah.
		그럼요, 네. 
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	Do you want me to take it away?
		내가 그냥 가져갈까?
00:01:15	 
		 
00:01:15	No, it's okay.
		아뇨, 괜찮아요.
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:17	El Oro State Forest--that's
		east of Lake Tahoe, right?
		El Oro 주립 공원이면 타호 호수 동쪽이죠?
00:01:20	 
		 
00:01:20	Yeah.
		그래.
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:45	You get lost?
		길 잃었습니까?
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:46	Briefly.
		쪼금.
00:01:47	 
		 
00:01:47	Beautiful out here, though they
		could use a little more signage.
		풍문치곤 아름다운 곳이네. 
00:01:50	 
		 
00:01:50	Victim's name's Gabriel
		Porchetto Junior.
		피해자는 가브리엘 포르체또 주니어.
00:01:52	 
		 
00:01:52	Father's a big mob boss.
		아버지가 마피아 보스입니다.
00:01:54	 
		 
00:01:54	Runs narcotics and illegal
		gambling in the northeast.
		북동쪽에서 마약과 불법도박장 사업을 하죠.
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	They live in the city.
		This is a vacation house.
		살기는 시내에 살고 여긴 별장입니다. 
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	"Porchetto"-- that's
		Argentinian, I believe.
		포르체또, 아르헨티나인일거야. 아마도.
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	How can you tell?
		어떻게 압니까?
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:03	I used to read a lot
		of phone books.
		전화번호부에서 많이 봤어. 
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:06	As I recall, Buenos Aires
		had many Porchettos.
		기억하기론 부에노스 아이레스에 포르체또가 많았지. 
00:02:09	 
		 
00:02:09	You used to read phone books.
		전화번호부를 읽습니까. 
00:02:11	 
		 
00:02:11	Yes, it's an excellent mnemonic exercise.
		You should try it.
		기억훈련엔 최고라구. 너도 한번 해봐. 
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:15	Porchetto and his younger
		brother were throwing a party.
		포르체또는 동생과 파티를 열었습니다.
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:17	Had a half-dozen friends here.
		대여섯명 친구와 함께, 
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:19	Brought in hookers
		for entertainment.
		여자들도 불러서. 
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:21	Good, wholesome fun.
		광란의 파티, 좋구만. 
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:22	There's a security fence
		around the entire compound.
		별장 주변엔 울타리가 설치되어 있는데 
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:25	About a hundred yards
		back that way,
		길에서 100 야드 떨어진 지점에서 
00:02:27	 
		 
00:02:27	there's a blanket thrown
		over the barbed wire
		철조망 위로 담요가 걸려 있고
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:28	and footprints inside and out.
		그 안팎으로 발자국이 있다는군요.
00:02:30	 
		 
00:02:30	Looks like the point of entry.
		침입지점 같습니다.
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:33	And here we are.
		그래서 이거구만. 
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:44	Which one's the younger brother?
		동생이 누구야?
00:02:45	 
		 
00:02:47	Sergio.
		세르지오.
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:52	Yeah?
		네?
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:53	So you're Sergio, and, uh...
		who are you?
		네가 세르지오고, 그럼 그쪽은?
00:02:56	 
		 
00:02:56	Curtis Nett.
		I work for the family.
		커티스 넷. 일가를 위해 일하고 있소.
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	The enforcer.
		행동대장이시구나.
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	I work for the family.
		Ten years.
		일가를 위해 일해왔소, 십년 동안. 
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	Just tell us what happened.
		무슨 일이었는지 말해 보십쇼.
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:03	We were inside the
		house, partying.
		우리는 집 안에서 파티 중이었어요.
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:06	Gabe came out to the hot
		tub with one of the girls.
		형은 여자애 하나랑 노천탕에 들어갔는데 
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:08	There's a shot.
		총성이 들렸어요.
00:03:09	 
		 
00:03:10	Curtis and I run out and...
		커티스와 난 뛰쳐나갔고 
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:12	Gabe's... you know.
		형은 그만 이렇게... 
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:16	Girl's freaking out.
		여자애들은 겁을 먹었죠.
00:03:17	 
		 
00:03:17	I run to the fence.
		I see a guy just climbed over.
		울타리에 가보니 왠 놈이 펜스를 넘고 있었소.
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	I throw a shot at him.
		He throws a shot at me.
		우린 서로를 향해 총질을 했지. 
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:23	No one hit anything.
		He takes off running.
		하지만 아무도 맞지 않고 놈은 달아났소.
00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:25	You get a look at him?
		범인을 보셨나요?
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:27	White guy, jacket, baseball cap.
		백인이고 재킷을 입었고 야구모자를 썼소.
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	You gave your gun to
		the sheriff, right?
		총은 보안관에게 넘겼습니까?
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	That's right.
		그렇소.
00:03:32	 
		 
00:03:32	We need all the other guns,
		모든 총을 수거해야겠습니다.
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:33	the ones you and your friends
		hid before we got here.
		당신과 숨어버린 당신 친구들 것까지 다.
00:03:35	 
		 
00:03:35	Look at this mess.
		지금 꼴을 보시오.
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	You want to talk some
		crap weapons charges?
		고작 불법 총기 소지죄를 들먹일 때요?
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	We won't necessarily
		press charges,
		불법 총기 소지엔 관심이 없습니다. 
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	but I need every gun on the
		premises for a ballistics check.
		하지만 모든 총의 탄도분석을 해야 합니다.
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	I'll tell the guys.
		내가 가서 알릴게요.
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:45	You do that, Serge.
		그래라, 세르지오.
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	So what's the deal?
		어떻게 된 겁니까?
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	You--you work for the family, but
		you have no respect for him.
		일가를 위해 일한다며 도련님 취급을 않네요.
00:03:50	 
		 
00:03:50	Is that a question?
		그것도 질문이오?
00:03:51	 
		 
00:03:51	I don't know. Was it?
		모르겠는데. 그랬나?
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:53	Where's the girl?
		That's a question.
		여자는요? 이건 질문. 
00:03:56	 
		 
00:04:00	Her name is Janpen.
		이름은 젱펜. 
00:04:01	 
		 
00:04:02	She's Chinese.
		Doesn't speak English.
		중국인이고 영어를 못한대요.
00:04:04	 
		 
00:04:04	Okay. Hi.
		안녕. 
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:07	My name is Patrick.
		내 이름은 패트릭이에요.
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:12	We're gonna need a translator.
		통역사가 필요하겠군요.
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:15	What is that hideous
		thing on her shoulder?
		저 여자 어깨에 저 우스운건 뭐야?
00:04:17	 
		 
00:04:18	She speaks English.
		영어 하네. 
00:04:20	 
		 
00:04:20	She's just a little
		bit shy, right?
		그런데 조금 낯을 가리시나봐. 
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:24	I don't speak English.
		Guys don't talk to me.
		난 영어 안해. 남자들은 나한테 말 안 시키니까. 
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	It's better that way.
		그 편이 나아. 
00:04:28	 
		 
00:04:28	So what did you see when
		Mr. Porchetto was shot?
		포르체또가 총을 맞을때 뭘 봤죠?
00:04:30	 
		 
00:04:30	Nothing.
		아무것도.
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	There's a loud bang scares
		the crap out of me, and...
		총소리가 나고 너무 무서웠어.
00:04:34	 
		 
00:04:34	the guy's dead.
		I mean, I freaked out. That's it.
		남자는 죽었고 난 무서워 오줌을 쌀 뻔했지. 
		그게 다야.
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	What'd the shooter look like?
		범인은 어떻게 생겼던가요?
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	Didn't see him.
		보지 못했어.
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	You're a good liar--
		good, not great.
		좋은 거짓말쟁이네요. 최고는 아닌데, 좋아.
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:42	She saw him close up.
		가까이서 봤어.
00:04:43	 
		 
00:04:43	I know who these guys are, okay?
		그놈들 알긴 알아. 됐어?
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	I'm not getting involved.
		휘말리고 싶지 않을 뿐이야.
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Maybe you shot him.
		당신이 쐈을수도 있고. 
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:47	Yeah, I hid the gun in my pants.
		그래. 수영팬티 안에라도 총을 숨겨서 말야.
00:04:49	 
		 
00:04:49	I'm taking you in.
		We're gonna talk about this at the office.
		나랑 같이 가지. 얘기는 서에 가서 계속 하고. 
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	I don't have to go with you.
		너랑 같이 안 가.
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	I could arrest you
		for prostitution,
		매춘 행위로 체포할 수도 있어.
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	put you in cuffs, and book you.
		수갑 채워서 빵에 넣을 수도 있다고. 
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:55	Is that how you want to do it?
		그렇게 해주면 좋겠어?
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:58	Well, can I put some
		clothes on first?
		그럼 먼저 옷부터 입고 갈 수 있겠어?
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	Sure.
		그래. 
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:08	Interesting girl.
		재미난 아가씨네. 
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:11	So what's your take on this?
		그래서 당신 생각은 어떻습니까?
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	Well, the fresh air,
		my first mob hit...
		상쾌한 공기에 내 첫번째 마피아 사건... 
00:05:15	 
		 
00:05:16	I'm thrilled.
		흥분돼. 
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:59	What?
		뭐야?
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	The GPS says turn right,
		but I think it's confused.
		GPS에선 우회전 하라는데 아닌것 같아.
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:20	Morning. You lost?
		길을 잃으셨어요?
00:06:22	 
		 
00:06:22	We're fine, thanks.
		저흰 괜찮아요. 
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:48	Hang on.
		꽉 잡아! 
00:06:49	 
		 
00:07:27	Hey. You okay?
		이봐, 괜찮아?
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:36	Stop.
		거기 서.
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	Stop. I will shoot you.
		멈추지 않으면 쏘겠어.
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:44	Nice driving.
		운전 한번 잘하신다.
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:51	Don't waste your time.
		There's no signal.
		시간낭비 하지 마. 신호 없어. 
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:55	There was some noise over there,
		like some kind of animal.
		저쪽에서 소리가 나는데 동물인가봐.
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Freaked me out. Unlock me, okay?
		무서워 죽겠어. 수갑 풀어줘.
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	Look, we can't stay here,
		우린 여기 안 있을거야.
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	and we can't go back
		up to the road.
		도로 쪽으로도 못 돌아가.
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	There's too much chance
		우릴 쫓는 남자와 
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	of running into that
		guy who's after us.
		다시 마주칠 가능성이 너무 커.
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:07	We follow the
		stream east a ways,
		강을 따라 동쪽으로 가면
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	we'll probably run
		into State Route 4.
		4번 도로랑 만날 수 있을거야.
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	We can catch a
		cell signal there.
		거기서는 신호도 있을거고. 
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:12	I'm not going anywhere.
		가긴 어딜 가.
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	It's not a choice.
		다른 선택이 없어.
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	Can't make me.
		끌고는 못 갈걸.
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:17	We need help.
		I'm trying to protect you.
		도와달래야 해. 널 보호하려는 거야.
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	Yeah, so I can testify...
		against the mob.
		마피아한테 불리한 증언을 하게 말이지. 
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:23	Forget it.
		꿈 깨시지.
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:25	Okay.
		좋아. 
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:27	I'll go by myself.
		나 혼자 간다. 
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	Cool. Unlock me.
		쿨하네. 수갑 풀어주고 가.
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	I need to know where to find
		you when we come back for you.
		다시 돌아왔을때 네가 어딨는지 알 수 있어야 해. 
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:32	Hey, you can't do that.
		진짜 그럴거 아니지. 
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	Watch out for rattlesnakes.
		방울뱀 잘 보고 있어라. 
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	They're all over
		through these woods.
		근처 숲에 굉장히 많거든.
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:39	Okay, wait!
		알았어, 잠깐! 
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:42	I've spoken with the
		forestry service.
		산림감시대하고 말해놨으니 
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	They're beginning a
		coordinated search
		보안관서랑 같이 
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	with the sheriff's office.
		합동수색을 시작할거야.
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	It's likely the GPS gave
		Van Pelt bad directions.
		GPS가 잘못됐을 가능성이 커. 
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:49	They've had people
		lost this way.
		신호가 종종 교란되는 곳이래. 
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	They don't think she's
		gonna be hard to find.
		찾는데 그리 어렵진 않을거라고.
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	We should be out there.
		우리도 이럴게 아니에요.
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	Get some of our people looking.
		우리쪽도 사람을 모아 나갑시다.
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	- More boots on the ground.
		- Whoa--
		- 인원이 많을수록 좋으니까요.
		- 잠깐. 
00:08:55	 
		 
00:08:55	They don't think she's
		gonna be hard to find?
		찾는데 어렵지 않다구요?
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	They're not taking
		this seriously.
		진지하게 할 생각이 없잖아요.
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:57	How big is the area
		they're searching?
		수색구역이 얼마나 큰데요?
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	140 square miles.
		It sounds pretty serious to me.
		140평방마일이면, 그들도 장난삼아 하는건 아냐.
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:01	Hey. If you were out there,
		we'd look for you.
		국장님이 조난 당했으면 저흰 나갔을 겁니다.
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	I hope not.
		그러지 않길 바라네. 
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:05	If I'm lost, I want a
		search-and-rescue team
		내가 길을 잃은 입장이라면 
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:07	that knows the landscape
		and can cover ground fast.
		지형에 익숙한 수색구조팀이 나서주길 바랄거야.
00:09:09	 
		 
00:09:09	That's not us.
		우린 아니잖아. 
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	Now I will make sure every
		resource is devoted
		모든 가용 자원을 동원해 
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	to finding Van Pelt. Okay?
		반펠트를 찾기로 하지, 알겠나?
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	Meantime, let's do our jobs.
		그동안은 우리 일을 해야 돼. 
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:20	Boss, we need to be--
		반장님, 저희가... 
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	He's right.
		We don't know the terrain.
		국장님 말이 옳아. 우린 그 지역 몰라. 
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:23	We'll just get in the way.
		우린 가봤자 방해나 될거야.
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:25	Let's focus on what we can do.
		우리가 할 수 있는 일부터 하자.
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:27	What do you got?
		알아낸건? 
00:09:27	 
		 
00:09:29	Ballistics came in.
		Junior was shot with a .380.
		탄도분석이 나왔고, 피해자는 38미리에 맞았어요.
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:32	One casing found at
		the crime scene,
		탄피 하나가 현장에서 발견됐고 
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	another, 10 yards
		outside the fence.
		다른 하나는 펜스에서 밖으로 10야드 지점에서요.
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	So that must have been the
		shot the killer fired at Nett
		그 범인이 도주하면서 
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	when he was running away.
		넷에게 쏜 총알이겠지.
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	Any luck on the
		trace of the gun?
		총기 추적에서는?
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:40	No. Nothing.
		아직까지 나온게 없어요.
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	This feels like a hit to
		me, like a pro at work.
		전문가 소행 같아. 
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:45	He had to have driven there.
		차를 타고 접근해야 했을테니 
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	Let's check the gas stations
		and the convenience stores
		별장으로 가는 길목의 
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:48	on the road to the cabin.
		주유소와 편의점을 체크해봐.
00:09:49	 
		 
00:09:49	Maybe he stopped off somewhere.
		어딘가에 들렀을지 몰라. 
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	Do we have anything on
		the witness--Janpen?
		젱펜? 증인한테선 얘기 없어? 
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:53	No arrests. The other hookers
		didn't have anything to say.
		체포를 안했습니다. 다른 여자들은 필요가 없구요.
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	I'm talking to Vice,
		넷과 얘기해 
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	trying to find the pimp
		that arranged the party.
		파티를 조직한 포주와 연락해 보겠습니다.
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	Let's take a hard look at the
		wiseguys that were there.
		개중 뺀질거리는 놈이 있다면 잘 봐둬.
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	If someone would know how to
		hire a hit man, it's them.
		전문 살수를 고용할 법한 놈들이니까. 
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:04	Van Pelt is gonna be
		back here in 20 minutes,
		반펠트는 20분내로 돌아올거야.
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:06	and we're all gonna feel
		stupid for worrying.
		괜한 걱정 했다고 생각할 거라고. 
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:18	File on Porchetto Senior's
		quite an interesting read.
		포르체또 주니어의 파일 말이야, 재밌더라. 
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	Murder, robbery, thuggery--
		all sorts of skullduggery.
		살인, 강도, 살인강도, 모든 종류의 사기,
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	The organized crime unit's been
		after Porchetto for a while.
		조직범죄 전담반이 한동안 쫓아다녔어.
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:30	There's nothing more you can do.
		네가 할 수 있는 일도 없어.
00:10:31	 
		 
00:10:31	About what?
		뭐가?
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	Van Pelt.
		That's what you're fretting about.
		반펠트 말이야. 그래서 풀죽어 있는 거잖아. 
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	Van Pelt is missing
		because of the murder,
		반펠트는 살인사건 때문에 실종된 거니까
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	ergo, we focus on
		catching the murderer,
		살인범 잡는데 집중하면 
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	chances are we'll find Van Pelt...
		다른 누군가 먼저 찾아내지 않는 한 
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:41	unless someone else
		finds her first,
		반펠트를 찾아낼 가능성이 커지겠지. 
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:43	but right now? Let's go.
		Porchettos.
		하지만 당장은? 포르체또부터. 
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:52	Agent Lisbon. Mr. Jane.
		리스본 요원, 제인씨.
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	Andrew Kellogg.
		I'm the Porchettos' attorney.
		앤드류 켈로그, 포르체또가의 변호사입니다. 
00:10:56	 
		 
00:10:56	This is Iris Porchetto,
		Gabe's stepmother.
		가브리엘의 계모인 아이리스 포르체또구요.
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	Where is Mr. Porchetto?
		포르체또씨는요?
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:00	On his way.
		He's not feeling well.
		오는 중이세요. 컨디션이 안 좋으셔서.
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	We'll have to keep this brief.
		간단하게 하죠.
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:03	We'll have to be thorough,
		자세히 할 겁니다.
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	but I'll keep your
		concerns in mind.
		포르체또씨 상태는 염두에 두죠.
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	Let's play cards up, agent.
		톡 까놓고 얘기하십시다.
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	The police have unjustly hounded
		the Porchettos for years.
		경찰은 포르체또가를 어떻게 하려고 
		수년간 별러왔잖아요.
00:11:12	 
		 
00:11:12	I will not stand for
		that sort of thing.
		그런 거라면 못 참습니다.
00:11:14	 
		 
00:11:14	These the cops?
		이게 경찰이야?
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:16	We're with the CBI,
		Mr. Porchetto.
		CBI에서 왔습니다, 포르체또씨. 
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:18	This is who they send to
		find my boy's killer?
		내 아들 죽인 놈 잡으라고 보낸 놈들이라고?
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:22	A girl and a guy with a vest.
		계집애에 조끼 입은 놈팽이?
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:24	This is really a waste of my time.
		I want a drink.
		정말이지 시간낭비군. 술 한잔 하고 싶어.
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:27	No.
		안돼요.
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	Gabe is dead.
		I can have a drink.
		가브리엘이 죽었어. 술 한잔 정돈 할 수 있어. 
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:30	Not with your meds.
		You heard the doctor.
		의사 말 들으세요.
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	It's got bad interaction.
		상태가 더 나빠졌다잖아요.
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	Uh, excuse me.
		Where is the cancer?
		실례하지만 무슨 암이시죠?
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	What's your name?
		이름이 뭐라고?
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	Jane. Patrick Jane.
		Liver? Kidney? Spleen?
		제인, 패트릭 제인입니다. 
		간? 신장? 비장?
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:42	Kidney.
		신장. 
00:11:42	 
		 
00:11:43	Oh. How long did they give you?
		얼마나 오래요?
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	"How long"? I'm a dead man.
		That's how long.
		난 오늘 내일 하는 몸이야. 
		그만큼 오래지. 
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:48	Having trouble
		sleeping, I expect.
		주무시는데 어려움이 있으시겠네요.
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:51	Yes. Why?
		그래. 왜?
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:53	Well, I can tell you
		how to get to sleep
		아들을 죽인게 누군지 짐작가는 바를
		말씀해 주시면
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	if you tell us who you
		think killed your son.
		숙면을 취할 수 있는 법을 말씀드리죠.
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	Who says I know?
		내가 안다고 누가 그래?
00:11:59	 
		 
00:11:59	Well, you said you were
		wasting your time with us,
		그야 저희 만나는게 시간낭비라 하셨으니
00:12:02	 
		 
00:12:02	so I assumed you already
		knew who was responsible.
		속으론 짚이는 데가 있으시단 거죠.
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	Do you, Mr. Porchetto?
		그렇습니까, 포르체또 씨? 
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	- Don't say anything.
		- Honey, listen to Andrew.
		- 아무 말도 하지 마십쇼.
		- 자기, 앤드류 말 들어요.
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	This one--can't wait to
		put me in the ground.
		난 이것 때문에 곧 죽어.
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	That's not true.
		그렇지 않아요.
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:12	That's not true.
		그렇지 않아.
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:13	Maybe just a little true?
		어쩌면 요만 요만큼은 진짜일수도?
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:16	You want me to do your job?
		Fine.
		너희들 일을 대신 해달라? 좋아.
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:19	It was the Mexicans.
		멕시칸 놈들일거야.
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	What Mexicans?
		무슨 멕시칸요?
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	Julio Iglesias.
		Who do you think?
		훌리오 이글레시아스지 그럼 누구겠어?
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	The Zetas. The Zetas.
		Zetas 패밀리 말이야.
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	- The Mexican drug cartel?
		- Yeah.
		- 마약 카르텔?
		- 그래.
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	Why would they want
		to kill your son?
		왜 댁의 아드님을 노렸죠?
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	I'm not saying any more.
		더는 말 못해. 
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:33	About that sleeping trick...
		이제 어떡해야 잘 수 있는지 말해. 
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	Oh, yes.
		When you breathe in, count one.
		아, 그거요. 들이쉴때 숫자 하나 세고 
00:12:37	 
		 
00:12:38	When you breathe out, count two.
		내쉴때 숫자 둘 세고
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	In one, out two. Very simple.
		하나 둘, 하나 둘, 굉장히 간단하죠.
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	Think of nothing else, except
		your breath and those numbers.
		다른 생각은 일절 말고 호흡이랑 하나 둘만 
		생각하세요.
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	And that will make me sleep?
		그럼 잘 수 있다고?
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	Like a big, murderous baby.
		잔인한 살인자처럼 깊이 재워준다네, 베이비. 
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:52	Ciao.
		챠오. 
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:56	Organized Crime Unit says
		전담반 말로는 
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	Junior wanted the Porchettos
		to sell meth in the northeast.
		포르체또가 북동쪽에서 메테드린 사업을 하려 했대요.
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	The Zetas control the drug
		trade in that territory.
		그곳 마약사업은 제타 패거리의 몫이니. 
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	If junior did make a move,
		they could have killed him.
		포르체또가 가로채려 했다면
		제타들이 나섰을 수 있어요. 
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	Call Bernie Westeroff
		in Narcotics.
		마약반 Bernie Westeroff와 연락해봐. 
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	See if he has a line on any
		Zeta foot soldiers in the area.
		제타 행동대원과 연결할 수 있는지. 
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	- Maybe we can talk to one of 'em.
		- Yeah, you got it.
		- 어쩌면 그중 하나랑 얘기할 수 있을지도.
		- 알겠습니다.
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	You're gonna get a Mexican
		drug dealer to talk?
		멕시칸 마약상과 얘기를 하겠다고? 
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	I'll think of something.
		나도 생각이 있어. 
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:17	Wayne.
		웨인.
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:20	Sarah.
		사라.
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	Yeah, I was looking for you.
		Lunch.
		우리 점심 먹기로 했는데. 
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	Oh. Damn. I forgot.
		이런. 잊고 있었어요.
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:25	No, look, I'm sorry.
		Grace is missing.
		너무 미안해요. 그레이스가 실종되어서. 
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	Oh, my lord. What's happened?
		그거 어떡해, 어쩌다가요?
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	Um, we--we don't know.
		Look, she was in a state park and...
		우리도 몰라요. 주립 공원에 있었는데... 
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:33	Anyway, I have to work.
		I'm sorry.
		아무튼 지금 일이 바빠요. 미안해요.
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	Of course. You work.
		We'll just do it another time.
		그래요. 우린 다른 때 만나면 되죠.
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Thanks.
		고마워요.
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Yeah. Just call me later, okay?
		나중에 전화해요, 알았죠?
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:39	And I'm sure it's fine.
		She's fine.
		그레이스는 괜찮을 거예요.
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:41	Thanks.
		고마워요.
00:13:42	 
		 
00:14:00	It's really hard
		to walk like this.
		이 상태로 걷는거 너무 힘들어.
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:02	Should have thought of
		that before you ran.
		그러게 도망치기 전에 생각을 잘했어야지.
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:10	Stay here.
		기다려.
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:36	Hey, Grace.
		안녕, 그레이스.
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:44	Who are you?
		누구야?
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:45	Come on, Grace.
		이봐, 그레이스.
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	Craig's dead. I killed him.
		크레이그는 죽었어. 내가 죽였다고.
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	Yeah. Yeah, you did that.
		그래, 그랬지.
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:51	Are you a ghost?
		유령인가?
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:53	What do you think?
		네 생각은 어때?
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:58	If you're not a ghost,
		what are you?
		유령도 아니면 넌 뭐야?
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	Grace, look, you've
		been in a car accident.
		그레이스, 넌 교통사고를 당했어.
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:02	You're dehydrated,
		pumped on adrenaline.
		탈수증세에 아드레날린이 솟구쳤지. 
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Maybe I'm just something
		you're seeing.
		그래서 그냥 보이는 거야.
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:07	The question is, why now?
		문제는 왜 지금일까?
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:11	Why do you need
		to see me, Grace?
		지금 내가 왜 보이는 걸까? 
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:15	What's going on?
		뭐야?
00:15:16	 
		 
00:15:17	Nothing. Let's keep walking.
		아무것도. 계속 걸어. 
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:30	Hey, Lisbon.
		리스본. 
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:32	What'd you get for me, Bernie?
		가져온 건 뭐야, 버니?
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	You wanted a Zeta, I got you one.
		Luis Osorio.
		제타랑 연결해 달랬지. 한 놈 있어. 
		Luis Osorio.
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	A lieutenant, connected,
		should know stuff.
		중간 보스 급이니 뭔가 알거야.
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	I owe you one. Thanks.
		내가 신세를 졌어, 고마워.
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	Yeah, maybe not.
		아닐지도 몰라. 
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	The charge I got Osorio on
		is bogus, and he knows it,
		오소리오는 가짜 혐의로 잡아둔거야. 놈도 알지. 
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	so all he's gotta do is
		keep his mouth shut.
		그러니 입을 쳐닫고 있을거야.
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	His lawyer gets here, he walks.
		변호사만 왔다 하면 나갈거야.
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	I like my chances.
		하는데까지 해봐야지. 
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:56	Hi, Mr. Osorio.
		Uh, Patrick Jane.
		오소리오씨, 패트릭 제인이에요.
00:15:59	 
		 
00:16:00	Sorry we've kept you so long.
		오래 기다리게 해서 미안합니다.
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:02	Promise we won't keep
		you much longer.
		더는 오래 붙잡지 않을 겁니다.
00:16:04	 
		 
00:16:06	You play cards?
		카드 하세요?
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:09	Want to play a little game?
		나랑 살짝 놀아볼래요?
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:12	It's Find The Queen. All right?
		여왕을 찾아라, 좋아요?
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:15	There she is there.
		아가씨가 여기 있다가 여기. 
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:17	All you have to do is find her.
		아가씨만 잘 보고 있으면 돼요.
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:19	You follow the queen, you keep
		an eye on where she goes,
		아가씨를 따라서, 아가씨가 어디로 가나
		계속 눈여겨 보세요.
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	and then you bet.
		그리고 걸어요.
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	There. Not here. There she is.
		여기 있네, 이건 아니죠. 여기 있군요.
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:29	Where is she?
		아가씨는 어디 있죠?
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:31	I don't give a
		damn where she is.
		여자가 어딨는지 안 가르쳐줘.
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:35	What do you think I am? A child?
		내가 바보인줄 알아?
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:36	Excuse me. I was just trying
		to kill a little time.
		난 그냥 시간이나 죽이러 온 거라구요.
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:46	Where is she?
		아가씨는요?
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	She's on the right.
		오른쪽. 
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:54	How you do that?
		어떻게 한 거야?
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	The hype.
		트릭이죠.
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	You pick up two cards between
		your fingers like so,
		손가락 사이에 두 장을 끼워요.
00:16:59	 
		 
00:17:00	but when you throw down,
		하지만 내려놓을 땐 
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	it appears that you
		throw the bottom card,
		아랫쪽 카드를 내려놓는 것처럼 보이죠.
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	when in fact, you
		throw the top card.
		하지만 사실은 윗카드를 내려놓고 있는데.
00:17:06	 
		 
00:17:07	Like that.
		이렇게. 
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	See how that looked like
		it was the bottom card?
		어떻게 밑장으로 보이는지 알아챘나요?
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:12	Nice.
		잘하는데.
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	You hold it like that, you just
		drop it down there like that.
		쥘때는 이렇게, 내려놓을 때는 이렇게. 
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:16	It's very easy. Lot of practice.
		쉬워요. 연습만 하면 돼요.
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	It's fun to watch, when you know
		what's happening, isn't it?
		트릭을 아니까 재미있죠?
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	Kind of relaxing. Soothing.
		그럼 마음 편안히 먹고 차분하게 
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:28	Tell me something.
		말해봐요.
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:31	You think the Zetas
		killed Gabriel Porchetto?
		제타가 가브리엘 포르체또를 죽였을까요?
00:17:34	 
		 
00:17:34	Nah. Zetas didn't have
		any reason to kill him.
		제타는 놈을 죽일 이유가 없어.
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Not yet, anyhow.
		아직까지는. 어쨌거나.
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:40	Man was all talk.
		사내는 허세지.
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:42	Good to know.
		그랬구나.
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:44	All right, you try.
		이제 직접 해 봐요.
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:47	Go ahead.
		해보래두.
00:17:48	 
		 
00:17:52	Look at you. You're a natural.
		타고나셨네. 
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	Look at the way you
		hold those cards.
		카드 쥔 손을 봐요.
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:57	And you drop the first
		one down just like that.
		첫번째 장을 그렇게 내려놔요.
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Two hands, let it flop.
		두손으로 탁, 탁.
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	That's a beginning, that's a start.
		Baby steps.
		여기부터, 이게 시작이에요. 걸음마예요.
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:06	Who do you think
		killed Porchetto?
		포르체또를 누가 죽였을까요?
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:08	Well, people say, uh...
		소문으로는 
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:11	he got into a fight
		with a biker.
		폭주족과 싸움이 붙었대. 
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:15	Biker named Wood. Ha.
		이름이 우드랬나.
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:18	Almost have it. Almost.
		거의 하셨어요. 거의요.
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:21	You can swindle people
		before you behead them,
		이제 다른 사람을 목베기 전에
		갖고 놀 수 있어요.
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	or whatever it is
		you do to them.
		목을 베거나. 뭐든지. 
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:27	I never beheaded nobody.
		나는 목벤적은 없어.
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:30	Slit a few throats maybe.
		칼집은 몇번 낸 적 있지만.
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:32	Okay. Zero beheadings.
		알았어요, 0명 참수. 
00:18:35	 
		 
00:18:37	Ran the biker named Wood.
		우드라는 폭주족 조사를 해 봤습니다.
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	There's an incident report
		on a bar fight Junior had
		2주전 Elwood Spiller라는 치와 
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	with a gang member named
		Elwood Spiller two weeks ago.
		포르체또가 술집에서 시비가 붙었다는 기록이 있군요.
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:44	No arrest.
		Spiller refused to press charges.
		체포는 없었고 스필러가 고소하지 않았습니다.
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	Find out what it was about.
		어떻게 된건지 알아봐.
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	Boss, check this out.
		반장님, 이거 보세요.
00:18:48	 
		 
00:18:48	Nothing from the gas
		stations in the area,
		근처 주유소에서 나온건 없지만
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	but I found some video cameras
		near the crime scene--
		현장 근처에서 비디오 영상이 나왔어요.
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	some professor studying
		animal migration patterns.
		야생동물 이동경로를 조사하는 교수중 하나가
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	One of them caught a white
		male driving on a road
		포르체또 별장에서 총격이 있고 직후에 
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	near the Porchetto cabin
		right after the shooting.
		백인 남자가 운전해 가는걸 찍었어요.
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Did they get the plate?
		번호판 보여?
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	No, but we were able
		to enhance the image.
		아니요. 하지만 이미지를 보정할 수 있어요.
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:02	Asked the FBI to run it through
		the facial recognition software,
		FBI 안면인식 프로그램을 돌렸더니 
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:05	got a few hits, and this one
		seemed like the best shot.
		몇개 나왔는데 그중 이게 제일 가능성 있어요.
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	Raynor Marquette. He's from LA.
		He's got a long sheet.
		Raynor Marquette. LA에서 왔고 전과가 많아요.
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	FBI thinks he runs
		guns into Tijuana
		FBI말론 티후아나로 도망간 것 같고
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	and that he's a killer for hire.
		살인청부업자래요.
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	See if you can find out
		anything else about him
		가능한 것 전부 조사해보고 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	and send that picture to the
		county sheriff's office.
		사진 보안관서로 보내줘.
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	Okay. Hey.
		You, uh, hear anything?
		반장님, 거기선 아직 아무 얘기 없어요?
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	They've covered 40% of the search area.
		Nothing yet.
		지역의 40%정도 수색했대. 아직 없어. 
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:27	So where are you from?
		어디서 왔어?
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	Barstow.
		Barstow.
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:30	A cousin of my mom's raised me.
		엄마 사촌이 날 키워줬어. 
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:32	Meth head.
		Not so great with the mother thing.
		마약 중독자였으니 좋은 엄만 못 됐지. 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:35	She got me started in
		this massage parlor.
		안마시술소 접수부터 보게 시켰어.
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	I was, like, 11, maybe.
		그때가 11살이었나.
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:42	I wasn't the youngest.
		나보다 어린애도 있었어. 
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:45	Anyways, a couple years after,
		아무튼 몇년 후에 
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	this Guatemalan arms
		dealer bought me.
		이 과테말라 무기상이 날 샀지.
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:50	And I was, like, his pet.
		애완동물처럼. 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:53	And that was kind of weird.
		그게 또 이상한게 
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:55	And then he got k--
		무기상도 후에 죽... 
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:59	Are you okay?
		괜찮아?
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	No!
		아니!
00:20:01	 
		 
00:20:01	Bitch, take these off.
		이거 풀란 말이야, 썅년아.
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:05	Like I'm gonna run. Where?
		내가 도망가면 어디로 가니?
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	I have no idea where we are
		난 여기가 어딘지도 모르고 
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	or how to get to where
		you say we're going.
		네가 가자는데 어떻게 가야 하는지도 몰라.
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:12	Last thing I'm gonna
		do is take off.
		딴건 몰라도 도망은 안 가.
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:19	All right.
		알았어.
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:21	Thank you.
		고마워.
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:23	It's getting dark.
		어두워질거야.
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:25	We need to find a place
		to spend the night.
		노숙할 곳을 찾아야 해. 
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:30	Shouldn't there be people out looking for us?
		Where are they?
		사람들이 찾으러 올거라며? 어딨는데?
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	I don't know. Come on.
		나도 몰라. 따라와.
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:36	Come on.
		어서.
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:53	Elwood Spiller.
		Kimball Cho, CBI.
		엘우드 스필러. CBI의 킴벌 조다.
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:56	I want to talk about
		Junior Porchetto.
		주니어 포르체또에 관해 얘기하러 왔다.
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	Did you and he have a
		fight on the 17th?
		17번가에서 싸운 적이 있지?
00:20:59	 
		 
00:21:00	No, we did not.
		아니.
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	Well, according to
		the incident report,
		사건사고 리포트에 의하면 
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	you got into an
		argument with Junior,
		네가 주니어와 언쟁을 벌였고
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:05	and he had three of his
		guys beat you to a pulp.
		주니어가 남자 셋을 시켜 널 늘씬하게 패줬다던데. 
00:21:07	 
		 
00:21:07	Nope.
		아니. 
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	Well, how'd all this happen?
		그럼 이건 다 뭐지?
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	A boating accident.
		선박 사고야.
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	Now Junior did this to you.
		주니어가 한게 맞군. 
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:13	Now you must have
		a major grudge,
		주니어에게 앙갚음할게 있으니 
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:15	and we can talk about it
		here, or I can take you in,
		여기서 얘길 하든가 아니면 서로 가서 
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	you can sit in a cell and
		talk about it tomorrow.
		일단 유치장에 앉아 있다가 내일 얘길 하든가.
00:21:19	 
		 
00:21:20	Old man Porchetto is on a hunt.
		포르체또 늙은이가 수배령을 내렸어. 
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	Anybody he thinks had anything
		to do with hitting Junior
		주니어랑 약간이라도 험한 일이 있던 놈은 
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:26	is gonna get clipped.
		쥐도새도 모르게 죽을거야.
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	So you can take me
		wherever you'd like.
		그러니 유치장이든 뭐든 가주지. 
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:33	All I'm saying
		내가 할 말은 
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:35	is Junior Porchetto was
		one hell of a guy,
		주니어 포르체또는 남자중의 남자였고 
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	and he always treated me good.
		나한텐 언제나 잘해줬단 거야.
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:47	You do know his old
		man is sick, right?
		늙은이가 아픈건 알고 있지?
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:50	When he dies, come back.
		늙은이가 아주 죽거든 다시 와.
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:54	I might say something different.
		그땐 조금 다른 얘기를 해 줄테니까.
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	Interesting.
		재미있군. 
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:59	He said, come back after
		the father's dead.
		그 아버지가 죽으면 다시 오랬단 말이지.
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	That's right.
		그렇습니다.
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:03	That's interesting.
		그거 참 재밌어.
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	We know killing Junior
		was a major play.
		주니어를 죽인건 큰 도박이야.
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	Whoever did it took a big risk.
		누가 했건 리스크가 컸을거야.
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:09	Must have expected a big payoff.
		Who's that?
		반드시 걸맞는 보상을 기대했겠죠. 누굴까요? 
00:22:10	 
		 
00:22:10	Hard to say.
		단언하기 어려워요.
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	According to the
		Organized Crime Unit,
		조직범죄 전담반 말론 
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	the main person who benefits
		from Junior's death
		주니어가 죽었을때 가장 큰 수혜자는
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	is old man Porchetto himself.
		포르체또 노인 본인이래요.
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	Why?
		왜?
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	Well, if they moved in
		after Zeta territory
		주니어가 하려던대로 
00:22:18	 
		 
00:22:18	just the way that Junior wanted,
		제타 영역에 들어가면 
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	they would have started a war.
		그 다음은 전쟁이 벌어질텐데 
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	Could have ended the
		Porchetto organization.
		포르체또 조직이 더 세거든요. 
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	Junior was getting in
		way over his head.
		그때면 주니어는 방해만 되죠. 
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:27	It's the sheriff's office.
		Lisbon.
		보안관서다. 리스본입니다.
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:32	Okay, thank you.
		알겠습니다. 감사합니다.
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:35	They're suspending the
		search for the night.
		밤이라 수색을 중단했대. 
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	They're gonna start again
		first thing in the morning.
		다음날 날 밝고 바로 재개한다고.
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	They're doing something wrong.
		뭔가 잘못하고 있어요.
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:40	They should have
		found her by now.
		지금쯤이면 찾았어야 해요.
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	They're doing something wrong.
		뭔가 잘못하고 있어.
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:43	Um, either of you play squash?
		둘 중 누구라도 스쿼시를 하는지?
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	What?
		뭐?
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:48	You know, squash.
		알잖아, 스쿼시.
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	No.
		아니.
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	No.
		아뇨.
00:22:51	 
		 
00:22:52	I need a squash ball.
		스쿼시 공이 필요한데. 
00:22:53	 
		 
00:22:56	It's about that big,
		little, black thing.
		크기는 이만하고 검은 색에. 
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:57	Doesn't bounce very well.
		너무 잘 튀지 않는걸로. 
00:22:58	 
		 
00:23:09	I know what you want to ask.
		뭘 묻고 싶어하는지 알아.
00:23:11	 
		 
00:23:11	Don't be embarrassed.
		당황하지 마.
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	I am not talking to you.
		난 너하고 얘기하는 거 아니야.
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:16	You are just a figment
		of my imagination.
		넌 내 상상의 산물일 뿐이야.
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	Please yourself.
		좋을대로 생각해.
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:28	Did you love me?
		날 사랑했어?
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:30	Of course I loved you.
		물론 사랑했지.
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	Then why did you try to kill me?
		그럼 왜 날 죽이려 했어?
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:34	I had to make a choice
		between you and Red John.
		레드존과 너 사이에서 선택했어야 했어.
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	We all have to make
		hard choices, Grace.
		누구나 힘든 선택을 할 때가 있지, 그레이스.
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:40	Doesn't make me evil.
		날 너무 나쁜 사람 만들지 마.
00:23:40	 
		 
00:23:42	Kind of does.
		그 비슷하잖아.
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	Grace.
		그레이스.
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:45	I was just too stupid to see it.
		네 본색을 몰랐다니 내가 멍청했지.
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:47	Oh, no, you saw it.
		아니, 넌 알고 있었어.
00:23:48	 
		 
00:23:48	No, I didn't.
		아니야.
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:49	Not all of it, but you
		knew there was something--
		적어도 네 일부는 그걸 간파했지. 
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:52	something a little dangerous
		under the nice guy stuff.
		선량한 체 하는 남자의 위험한 이면. 
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:55	You kind of liked it.
		넌 그걸 즐기기까지 했어.
00:23:56	 
		 
00:23:58	Can't open your eyes
		a little bit, Grace.
		너는 눈을 반쯤 감고 있는거야, 그레이스. 
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:00	Gotta open 'em all the way
		네가 진실을 보고 싶다면 
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:02	if you want to see
		the truth of things.
		눈을 바르게 뜨고 있어야지.
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:03	What are you talking about?
		무슨 말을 하는거야?
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:06	Why are you doing this to me?
		나한테 지금 왜 이러는 거야?
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:10	How should I know?
		내가 어떻게 알겠어?
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:12	I'm just a figment
		of your imagination.
		난 그저 네 상상의 산물일 뿐인데. 
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:56	Did you find your squash ball?
		스쿼시 공은 그래서 찾았어?
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	Oh, yes, I did, as a matter of fact.
		Thank you.
		어, 찾았고 말고. 
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	Um, I'm headed over
		to the Porchettos.
		지금 포르체또 가로 갈 건데 말야.
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	Why?
		왜?
00:25:04	 
		 
00:25:04	It probably won't
		work, but if it does,
		먹힐것 같진 않지만 만약 먹히면, 
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	you're gonna have to move
		fast, so stay on your toes.
		네가 빨리 움직여줘야 하니까 대기타고 있어.
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:11	Boss. They're looking
		in the wrong place.
		반장님, 수색대가 실수를 했어요.
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	What do you mean?
		무슨 뜻이야?
00:25:14	 
		 
00:25:14	The searchers messed up.
		수색대가 엉뚱한 데를 뒤졌다구요.
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	That's why they haven't
		found anything.
		그러니까 아무것도 못 찾은 거예요.
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:16	What's going on?
		어떻게 된 거야?
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:17	They started the search at
		the last cell phone tower
		수색대는 반펠트의 신호가 마지막으로 접속했던 
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	that Van Pelt's phone
		made contact with.
		기지국 중심으로 찾고 있는데 
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:20	They figured she was within a
		15-mile radius of this point.
		이 지점에서 반경 15마일 내라는 거죠.
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:23	That makes sense.
		말이 되잖아.
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:23	But they're wrong.
		I just checked.
		하지만 제가 봤는데 아니었어요.
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:25	The next cell phone tower, here,
		이 다음 기지국, 여기요.
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	was down for
		maintenance yesterday.
		어제는 수리중이었어요.
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	If her phone tried to make contact
		with this cell phone tower,
		이 기지국에 접속하려 했다면
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:30	there'd be no record.
		기록이 없을 거예요.
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	They should be looking 10 miles
		further into the forest.
		숲 방향으로 10마일은 더 가서 수색해야 했군요.
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	I'm going out there.
		I don't care what Wainwright says.
		제가 가야겠어요. 웨인라이트가 뭐라던간에요.
00:25:35	 
		 
00:25:35	You go.
		I'll deal with Wainwright.
		가봐. 웨인라이트는 내가 알아서 할테니. 
00:25:37	 
		 
00:25:42	Hey.
		안녕. 
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:43	Wayne, hi.
		Um, I know you're busy.
		웨인, 바쁜 건 아는데요.
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:45	I was just wondering
		how things are.
		어떻게 됐는지 궁금해서요.
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:48	Uh, we still haven't found her yet.
		I'm heading out there.
		아직 찾고 있는 중이고 저도 따라 가려구요.
00:25:50	 
		 
00:25:50	Um, well, I just want you to
		know I was thinking about you
		내가 당신 생각 하고 있고 
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:54	and praying for Grace, and...
		그레이스를 위해 기도한다는 걸 알려주고 싶어요.
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	I just know that this is gonna
		turn out all right.
		결국엔 다 잘 될 거예요.
00:25:58	 
		 
00:25:58	Thanks.
		고마워요.
00:25:59	 
		 
00:25:59	Listen, I have to go.
		미안한데 끊을게요.
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:00	The, uh, elevator's here.
		I'll call you later, yeah?
		엘리베이터를 타려구요. 나중에 전화할게요.
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:07	Janpen?!
		젱펜?
00:26:08	 
		 
00:26:09	Janpen?!
		젱펜?
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:11	Don't blame yourself.
		자신을 탓하지 마.
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	I fell asleep.
		잠들었어.
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	Yeah. You were tired.
		피곤했으니까.
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:15	She gets lost, she could die.
		그 여자 길을 잃으면 죽을거야.
00:26:17	 
		 
00:26:17	Why did I think I
		could stay awake?
		내가 왜 불침번을 설 수 있다고 생각했지?
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	Grace, everything
		isn't your fault.
		그레이스, 모든게 너의 잘못은 아니야.
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:20	This is my fault.
		내 잘못이야.
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:21	- I wasn't your fault.
		- Yes, you were.
		- 나도 네 탓이 아니야.
		- 아니야, 맞아.
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	You were with me when you killed
		those cops and you shot Lisbon.
		네가 경찰들을 죽이고 반장님을 쐈을때
		넌 내가 데려간 거였어.
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	I should have stopped you.
		내가 널 막았어야 했어.
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	You did. You killed me.
		막았잖아. 날 죽였잖아.
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:31	I was too late.
		너무 늦었지. 
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:32	I should have seen it sooner.
		I-I should have done something.
		내가 일찍 알아차려야, 
		내가 그 전에 뭐든 했어야 했어.
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	How? You were in love with me.
		Don't you remember?
		어떻게? 넌 내게 빠져 있었어. 기억나?
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:43	There she is.
		여자가 저기 있네. 
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:49	Where'd you go?
		어디 갔다 온거야?
00:26:50	 
		 
00:26:50	I had to pee.
		Who were you talking to?
		소변보러. 누구랑 얘기하고 있었어?
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:55	Nobody.
		아무도.
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	Great. Lost in the woods
		with a crazy cop.
		최고네. 미친 경찰과 조난 당하다니.
00:26:59	 
		 
00:27:00	Hey, I got it worse.
		나는 더 나빠. 
00:27:01	 
		 
00:27:01	I'm lost in the woods with
		a grumpy hooker. Let's go.
		투덜대는 창녀랑 조난 당했으니까. 이리 와. 
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:12	The silent intimidation
		act is quite effective.
		이 조용한 위협 작전은 효과가 좋지요.
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:16	I'll admit, I'm intimidated.
		인정해야겠군요. 나는 겁이 납니다.
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	Then he forced himself in
		here, and now he won't leave.
		무작정 밀고 들어와서 저러고 버티고 있어.
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:20	You have to do
		something, Andrew.
		당신이 어떻게 해봐, 앤드류. 
00:27:20	 
		 
00:27:20	Iris. You need to relax.
		Tension causes wrinkles.
		아이리스, 진정해요. 긴장하면 주름 생겨요.
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:24	Mr. Jane, what are
		you doing here?
		제인씨, 여기서 뭐하시는 겁니까?
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:25	I'd like to speak to
		Mr. Porchetto.
		포르체또씨와 말씀 나누고 싶습니다.
00:27:27	 
		 
00:27:27	You can't talk to him.
		그렇게는 못해요.
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:28	Yes, I can.
		I talk to all sorts of people.
		할 수 있어요. 난 얘기 못할 사람이 없어요.
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	Do you see what I mean?
		This is...
		이제 내 말 알겠지? 저 남자.. 
00:27:32	 
		 
00:27:32	Mr. Jane, if you don't leave,
		제인씨, 계속 이러시면 
00:27:33	 
		 
00:27:33	I will protest to your superiors
		and the Attorney General.
		당신 상관과 검찰에 항의할 겁니다.
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:36	You can't harass my
		client like this.
		내 의뢰인을 이렇게 귀찮게 구시면 안되죠.
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:38	Excuse me, how long have you two
		been carrying on this affair?
		근데, 둘이 뒤로 사귄지는 얼마나 오래됐죠?
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	What do you mean?
		뭐라구요?
00:27:42	 
		 
00:27:42	Your protectiveness of
		Iris is more than legal,
		아이리스를 감싸는 투가 법적 요구 이상이네요.
00:27:45	 
		 
00:27:45	and she keeps touching your elbow.
		Hard to misinterpret.
		그리고 아이리스는 당신 팔꿈치를 자꾸 만지는데,
		오해할 수 없는 신호죠.
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	I'm pretty sure Curtis
		here already knows.
		커티스는 진작에 알았다에 걸겠습니다.
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	Yes, he looks dense, but
		he's as sharp as a tack.
		도무지 속을 모르겠지만 핀처럼 날카롭거든요.
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:54	Doesn't miss a beat,
		do you, Curtis?
		뭐든 놓치는게 없죠, 그렇죠 커티스?
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:57	This is...
		completely irrelevant.
		이건 정말이지 헛소리야.
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	Are you worried that
		Porchetto's gonna find out,
		포르체또가 알아챌까 겁이 나나요,
00:28:02	 
		 
00:28:02	or does it add a little
		more excitement?
		아니면 그래서 더 재밌어질까요?
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	Did you just threaten us?
		지금 날 협박하는 거야?
00:28:04	 
		 
00:28:04	All right, let's just
		take a breath here.
		일단 진정해.
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	What's going on?
		무슨 일들이야?
00:28:07	 
		 
00:28:09	You.
		너.
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	Well, good morning.
		좋은 아침입니다.
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:11	That trick--one two, one two--
		damned if it doesn't work.
		그 하나 둘, 하나 둘 하는 수작,
		안 통했으면 넌 죽었어.
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:15	- Fell asleep in no time.
		- Glad to hear it.
		- 세상 모르고 잤군.
		- 그렇다니 기쁩니다.
00:28:18	 
		 
00:28:18	What do you want?
		원하는게 뭔가?
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:20	Do you think we could
		talk someplace else?
		자리를 옮겨서 얘기할 수 있을까요?
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	It's kind of a private matter.
		조금 사적인 얘기라. 
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:35	So what is it?
		그래서 뭐야?
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:40	Well, colleague of
		mine is missing.
		제 동료가 실종됐어요.
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:42	I think it's connected
		to your son's murder.
		아드님 사건과 관련있는 것 같습니다.
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	You're still looking for
		the murderer, right?
		아직 그 범인 찾고 계시죠?
00:28:46	 
		 
00:28:47	Maybe.
		아마도.
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	Sure you are.
		You want to kill him.
		잡아 죽여야 하니까, 그러실 겁니다.
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:50	I get it, believe me,
		전 다 이해해요. 믿어도 좋아요.
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	but what I need to know
		is, have you found him?
		알고 싶은건 이겁니다. 찾으셨습니까? 
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:54	'Cause I'd like to talk to him,
		and then you can have him back.
		얘기 좀 하려구요. 그리고 돌려보내드리죠.
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	You can do whatever
		you want with him.
		그리고 뭐든간에 하고 싶은대로 하세요.
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	I don't know anything about it.
		난 아무것도 몰라.
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	Are you sure?
		정말요?
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	Yeah, I'm sure.
		그래. 
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	Crap.
		이런 젠장. 
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:03	You were my last hope.
		당신이 내 마지막 구명줄이었는데. 
00:29:05	 
		 
00:29:05	Okay. What do I do now?
		I could use a drink. Um...
		좋아. 이제 어쩐다? 술이 있어야겠어.
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:11	You don't have any
		vodka, do you?
		보드카 없죠?
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	I can't have booze around.
		My meds.
		의사 때문에 술은 옆에 못 둬. 
00:29:16	 
		 
00:29:16	Surely, you got a stash.
		꿍쳐놓은게 있으실텐데. 
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	I mean, a man like you
		would have a stash.
		당신같은 분들은 숨겨놓은게 있거든요. 
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:19	I only want a nip,
		just--maybe two.
		한 모금만, 아니 두 모금 정도만 마시면 돼요.
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	Really craving that warm,
		comforting feeling
		알콜이 목을 때리며 넘어갈때 
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:25	of alcohol hitting the
		back of your throat.
		그 따뜻한 안도감이 필요해요.
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	You know.
		Just-- it just levels me.
		그럼 좀 마음이 다스려지거든요.
00:29:29	 
		 
00:29:32	Uh, don't tell my wife.
		아내한텐 말하지 마. 
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:50	Love that sound.
		소리 좋고. 
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:54	You're a Saint. Thank you.
		당신은 천사예요. 고마워요.
00:29:56	 
		 
00:30:10	Yep, that's it. Just levels me.
		아, 이거야. 좀 살겠군. 
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	It's like an angel
		crying on your tongue.
		혀 위에서 춤추는 천사 같죠.
00:30:15	 
		 
00:30:17	That's good.
		이거 좋아. 
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:19	You?
		당신도?
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:21	Doctors say it messes me up.
		의사가 먹으면 안된대. 
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:23	Oh, them. Doctors.
		Always with the rules.
		의사들이란. 항상 꼬장꼬장하게 규칙만 말하고.
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	I mean, as if they know
		anything for sure.
		꼭 지들이 뭐든지 아는 것처럼. 
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:31	One.
		한 잔만. 
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:49	So Mike has a...
		그래서 마이크는... 
00:30:50	 
		 
00:30:51	pool cue, and, uh...
		당구채를 들고 있었는데..어.. 
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:55	Cheers.
		건배. 
00:30:56	 
		 
00:30:56	Cheers.
		And Sammy's right behind me.
		건배. 그리고 새미는 바로 내 옆에 있었지.
00:30:59	 
		 
00:31:00	And, uh...
		그래서.. 
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:02	and I have a shovel. He says...
		난 삽을 들었는데... 
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:17	Man down! Man down in here!
		사람이 쓰러졌어요! 여기요!
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:20	What the hell happened?
		무슨 일이요?
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:22	- He j--he just fell off. I don't know. Does--
		- Are you okay?
		- 그냥 쓰러졌어요. 왠지 모르겠어요. 
		- 여보 괜찮아?
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	Does he have a pulse? Check.
		맥박 있어요? 봐요.
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:27	I don't feel anything.
		안 느껴져.
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	- Let me check.
		- Oh, my God.
		- 내가 볼게. 
		- 이럴수가.
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	Is he breathing?
		I c--I can't tell if he's breathing.
		숨은 쉬어요? 숨쉬는지 모르겠어.
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:33	I'm not getting a pulse.
		맥박이 안 잡혀. 
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	I don't think he's breathing.
		숨쉬는 것 같지도 않아. 
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	Is this it? Is this happening?
		Oh, my God.
		정말이야? 정말 이렇게 된거야?
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:37	Call an ambulance.
		Someone call an ambulance!
		구급차, 누가 구급차 불러! 
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	I'll call. I'll call right now.
		내가 부를게. 
00:31:40	 
		 
00:31:40	What should we do?
		We should do something.
		어떡해, 어떻게 해야할거 아냐.
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	I'll get the guys.
		난 애들 불러올게. 
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	Well, we can't just leave
		him here for starters.
		사람이 올때까지 이러고 놔둘 순 없잖아요.
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:45	It's so undignified.
		품위 없게. 
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	Do you have a couch or somewhere
		where you can lay him down?
		소파라든지 들어 옮겨 놓을데가 없습니까?
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	In the front room.
		거실에 있어요.
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	Front room it is, then.
		그럼 거실로 옮겨요.
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	Guys. Come on, come on!
		여기! 여기로!
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	- I need a hand here. Thank you.
		- Not now, please, baby.
		- 누가 좀 도와주세요.
		- 여보, 지금은 안돼.
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	- Be careful with him.
		- Oh, please.
		- 조심들 해요.
		- 어떡해. 
00:31:56	 
		 
00:31:56	The living room.
		거실로.
00:31:57	 
		 
00:32:14	Porchetto's dead?
		포르체또가 죽은거야?
00:32:15	 
		 
00:32:15	Oh, more like drunk.
		취한데에 가깝지.
00:32:16	 
		 
00:32:16	Are you drunk?
		너 술먹었어?
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	A little.
		Let's not get distracted.
		쬐금. 초점을 흐리지 말자고.
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:19	I think someone is staging a coup
		inside the Porchetto family,
		포르체또 노인이 죽으면 
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	a takeover when
		the old man dies.
		쿠데타를 일으키려고 준비한 사람이 있을거야.
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:25	- That's who killed Junior.
		- Why?
		- 그가 바로 주니어를 죽였지.
		- 왜?
00:32:27	 
		 
00:32:28	Because Junior wanted
		to go to war with the Zetas--
		주니어는 제타와 전쟁을 하고 싶어했으니까.
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	would have destroyed the family
		그랬단 모반자가 조직을 접수하기도 전에 
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	before the plotter
		could take over.
		조직 자체가 괴멸될지 모르고. 
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	So you're trying to get the
		plotter to reveal himself
		그래서 포르체또가 죽은 것처럼 꾸미고
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	by pretending that
		Porchetto's dead?
		모반자가 나타나는걸 보려고?
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	Oh, you're very
		good, Grasshopper.
		똑똑해요, 리스본 학생. 
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:39	Won't the doctors figure
		out he's not dead?
		의사가 보면 바로 알지 않을까?
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	They're figuring it out now.
		That's why we have to work fast.
		이미 알았어. 그러니 빨리 움직여야지. 
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:44	I know it's a force, but
		Van Pelt is missing.
		무리란걸 알지만 반펠트가 실종 상태니까.
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	- Excuse me, doctor?
		- Yes.
		- 잠시만요, 선생님.
		- 네.
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	Uh, my name's Patrick Jane.
		I'm with the CBI.
		전 CBI의 패트릭 제인입니다.
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	Do you take much bribe
		money from big pharma?
		대형 제약업체에서 뇌물을 받고 계십니까?
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	What?
		뭐요?
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:54	That's an offensive suggestion.
		Why would you say that?
		정말 불쾌한 가정이군. 그런걸 왜 묻는거요?
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	Well, a lot of doctors...
		그, 많은 의사들이... 
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	What's he saying?
		뭐라는 거야?
00:32:59	 
		 
00:33:02	I mean, obviously,
		in any profession,
		사실 이런 전문직들이 많이... 
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:05	people fall short of
		the ethical mark.
		사람들은 직업 윤리를 잃어가고 있어요.
00:33:07	 
		 
00:33:08	What's that doctor
		saying to the cop?
		의사가 경찰한테 뭐라는 거야?
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	Mm, free trips to the Bahamas...
		바하마로 공짜 여행을 간다거나...
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:13	Think it's about dad?
		아버지 얘기인것 같아?
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	Well, thanks for chatting.
		말씀 감사합니다.
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:21	What was that doctor saying?
		의사가 뭐래요?
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:22	Well, he should probably
		tell you himself.
		선생님께서 직접 말씀하실 겁니다.
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:24	It's not really my place.
		제가 나설 자리가 아니라 되서요.
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:26	Mr. Jane, people are suffering.
		Tell us what you know.
		제인씨, 사람들이 걱정하잖아요. 
		그냥 말씀하십쇼.
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:30	We're very sorry for your loss.
		유감입니다.
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:33	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
		He's gone.
		어머, 어떡해. 이걸 어째, 죽었대. 
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	Son of a bitch.
		이런 빌어먹을. 
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:38	Can't help but feel a
		little responsible here.
		책임감을 느끼지 않을수가 없군요. 
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:41	What'd you do to him?
		아버지한테 뭘 어쩐거야?
00:33:42	 
		 
00:33:42	Serge.
		세르지오.
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	You were the last one with him.
		당신이 아버지 임종 자리에 있었잖아.
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	If I find out you did
		anything to him,
		당신이 뭐라도 잘못했다면 
00:33:46	 
		 
00:33:46	I swear you're gonna die.
		You hear me?
		맹세컨대 당신 죽일거야. 알아들어?
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:48	Shut up.
		닥쳐.
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	It's not a threat.
		It's a promise.
		이건 협박이 아니라 맹세다.
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:52	Shut... up. All right?
		닥치라고. 알아들어?
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:55	You can't say that to me.
		네가 감히 내게 그런 말을. 
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:57	You work for me.
		I'm in charge now.
		넌 날 위해 일하는 사람이야.
		내가 명령한다고.
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:58	No, you're not.
		아니야.
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:01	I am.
		명령은 내가 한다.
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:03	I talked to the crews, all of them.
		They're with me.
		조직원들과는 얘기가 끝났어. 모두 날 따르기로.
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:07	And we're gonna do
		this smooth and smart,
		우리는 과도기를 현명하게 넘길거다.
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:09	and we're not gonna go around
		그리고 공공장소에서 
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:10	threatening cops in public places.
		Got it?
		경찰을 협박하지도 않을거다. 알겠나?
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	- But you have--
		- No.
		- 하지만... 
		- 아니야.
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:15	No, he's right. Wait.
		저 말이 맞아.
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	We will talk at the house.
		얘기는 집에 가서 하지. 
00:34:18	 
		 
00:34:18	You're in charge now?
		그래서 당신이 두목인가?
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	This is none of your business.
		당신이 상관할 바가 아니오.
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	You need to speak with us alone.
		우리랑 잠깐 얘기 좀 합시다.
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:25	Right.
		좋소.
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:25	You really do.
		혼자만 오세요.
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:30	Wait here.
		기다려.
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:36	So?
		그래서?
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:43	What the hell?
		이게 뭐야?
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:44	It's an old trick.
		오래된 속임수지.
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	Small ball under the arm
		stops the blood flowing.
		작은 공을 겨드랑이에 끼우면 혈류가 그쳐,
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:49	No pulse.
		맥박이 없어지지. 
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:52	He's alive. That's great.
		살아있어 잘됐어.
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:55	Not for you.
		당신한텐 안 잘됐지. 
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:57	You hired Raynor
		Marquette to kill Junior
		당신이 레이놀 마퀘트를 고용해 주니어를 죽였어.
00:34:59	 
		 
00:34:59	because he was getting
		in your way, didn't you?
		주니어가 당신 계획에 방해가 되니까. 
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:01	Good luck proving that.
		한번 증명해 보시지. 
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:02	I don't have to prove it in court.
		I'll just tell him.
		법정에서 증명할 필요나 있나.
		포르체또한테 말하면 되지. 
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:14	Don't do that.
		그러지 마.
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	I will if I have to.
		그래야 한다면 할거야.
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	I think Marquette's put one
		of my people in danger.
		마퀘트가 우리 요원 하나를 위험에 빠뜨렸어. 
00:35:20	 
		 
00:35:20	You're gonna help us find him.
		마퀘트를 찾게 도와줘.
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:22	Or I will take you in there
		and sign your death warrant.
		아니면 저기 데리고 들어가 사형 선고를 내릴거야.
00:35:25	 
		 
00:35:25	I think she means it.
		정말 그럴건가봐.
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:29	We got Marquette's cell phone.
		마퀘트의 전화번호를 알아냈어.
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:30	We were able to track
		it to State Route 4
		포르체또 별장에서 동쪽으로 14마일 떨어진 
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	14 miles east of
		Porchetto's cabin.
		4번 도로야.
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:34	He must be somewhere nearby.
		그 근처에 있을거야.
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:36	Yeah, it's pretty close to here.
		네, 거의 다 왔어요.
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	I can get some rangers to
		meet me there. Thanks.
		거기서 산림감시원들과 만날 거예요.
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:41	So do you ever think
		about getting out of,
		그, 성산업을 
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:44	you know, sex work?
		그만 두려고는 생각해 봤어?
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:46	What kind of car you got?
		너 차 뭐 몰아?
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:48	Piece of crap, I bet.
		똥차겠지, 보나마나.
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:50	I drive a Lexus, fully loaded.
		난 풀옵션 렉서스 몰아.
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:53	Oh, excuse me.
		이봐.
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:55	There's more to life than that.
		인생에는 그게 전부가 아니라고.
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:59	Get down.
		엎드려.
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:01	Stay here. Don't make a sound.
		소리 내지 말고 가만히 있어.
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:17	Grace. Behind you.
		그레이스, 뒤야.
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:26	Bitch. Get off.
		이거 놔, 썅년아.
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:29	Stop.
		그만둬.
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:31	Get off.
		놓으라고!
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:32	Just... relax.
		가만...있어.
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:37	So I guess we can call
		it even now, huh?
		또 연락해도 되겠지?
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:42	Bye, Grace.
		안녕, 그레이스.
00:36:43	 
		 
00:36:43	Look after yourself.
		몸 조심해. 
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:48	Grace! Where are you?!
		그레이스! 어딨어!
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:50	Over here!
		여기야!
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:55	You okay?
		괜찮아?
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	Yeah, I'm fine.
		괜찮아. 
00:36:57	 
		 
00:37:07	This is your chance to do
		something for yourself, Janpen.
		스스로에게 도움이 될 수 있는 기회다, 젱펜. 
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	Marquette's still
		in the hospital.
		마퀘트는 아직 병원에 있다.
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:11	You talk first,
		네가 먼저 말하면 
00:37:12	 
		 
00:37:12	the DA will take first-degree
		murder off the table.
		검사가 일급살인 혐의는 면해줄거다.
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:19	No death penalty. You want that?
		사형은 피할 수 있지. 어떤가?
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:28	Marquette and I are a team.
		마퀘트와 난 한 팀이었어.
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:31	Part of the job is getting
		closer to the target.
		타겟에 가까이 접근하는 일, 
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:35	That's what I do.
		그게 내 역할이었지. 
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:46	Nett had planted the gun.
		총은 넷이 숨겨놨어.
00:37:48	 
		 
00:37:48	Nett grabbed the gun
		when he came out.
		넷이 총을 집어서 
00:37:49	 
		 
00:37:49	He took it to the fence.
		Raynor was waiting.
		레이놀이 기다리는 울타리 밖으로 던졌지. 
00:37:52	 
		 
00:37:54	We had to make it look like the
		shooter came from the outside.
		범인이 외부에서 침입한 것처럼 보이게 말야. 
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:58	That was Nett's thing.
		그게 넷의 계획이었어. 
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	He was terrified
		넷은 포르체또 노인에게 들킬까봐
00:38:01	 
		 
00:38:01	old man Porchetto would
		find out he was behind it.
		겁을 먹고 있었어.
00:38:04	 
		 
00:38:05	When I was sleeping, you found
		a cell signal, didn't you?
		내가 잠든 뒤에 휴대폰 신호가 잡힌거지?
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:09	That's how Marquette found us.
		You called him.
		네가 전화해 마퀘트가 우릴 찾은거야.
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:12	- Just wanted to get out of there.
		- By killing me.
		- 거기서 탈출할 작정이었어.
		- 날 죽이고.
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	Oh. Well, it wasn't personal.
		개인적인 원한은 없어.
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:18	Come on.
		이봐.
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:19	I kind of like you.
		You know, you're--you're hard-core.
		실은 널 좀 좋아했어. 넌 억센 구석이 있거든. 
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:23	I respect that.
		존경스럽더라. 
00:38:24	 
		 
00:38:26	Let's go.
		가자.
00:38:27	 
		 
00:38:43	Hey.
		안녕.
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:44	Hey.
		안녕.
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:47	How are you feeling?
		좀 어때?
00:38:48	 
		 
00:38:49	Better. Okay.
		훨씬 나아.
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:53	Come here.
		이리 와.
00:38:54	 
		 
00:38:57	Hi.
		안녕하세요.
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:59	Oh, hey.
		오, 안녕.
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:03	I heard you got back all right.
		무사히 돌아오셨다는 거 들었어요.
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:05	Yep. Safe and sound.
		네, 무사히 돌아왔어요.
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	Congratulations.
		It's just such great news.
		축하해요, 너무 좋은 소식이네요.
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	I'll see you tomorrow, Wayne.
		내일 봐, 웨인.
00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:11	Yeah, see you tomorrow.
		그래, 내일 봐.
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:12	Excuse me.
		잠시만요.
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:18	Um, you want to--you want
		to get something to eat?
		뭐 먹으러 갈래요?
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	Yeah. Absolutely.
		그럼요.
00:39:22	 
		 
00:39:28	I'm sorry if that
		was uncomfortable.
		아까 불편했다면 미안해요.
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	It didn't mean anything.
		Really. Nothing at all.
		아무 의미도 아니었어요. 정말 아무 의미도.
00:39:33	 
		 
00:39:34	No, it's okay.
		Wayne, I understand.
		괜찮아요, 웨인. 다 이해해요.
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:42	So... how have you been?
		어떻게 지냈어요?
00:39:44	 
		 
00:39:44	Good. Fine.
		잘 지냈죠.
00:39:46	 
		 
00:39:47	I'm pregnant.
		나 임신했어요.
00:39:48	 
		 
00:40:09	Jane?
		제인씨?
00:40:10	 
		 
00:40:11	I'm sorry to ask this, but...
		이런거 물어봐서 죄송한데요, 
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:14	do you ever talk to your wife?
		아내분이랑 대화한 적 있으세요?
00:40:16	 
		 
00:40:18	Yes, sometimes.
		응, 가끔.
00:40:20	 
		 
00:40:20	Do you ever see her?
		본 적도 있으세요?
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:22	No, never.
		아니, 전혀.
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:24	If you did see her...
		만약 아내분을 봤다면
00:40:25	 
		 
00:40:27	Would you think you were crazy?
		스스로 미쳤다고 생각하셨을까요?
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:32	Craig came to see
		you, didn't he?
		크레이그가 만나러 왔구나?
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:34	Yeah.
		네. 
00:40:35	 
		 
00:40:35	What did he want?
		뭘 원하든?
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:38	I don't know.
		모르겠어요.
00:40:39	 
		 
00:40:41	This will sound
		really weird, but...
		이렇게 말하면 정말 이상한데요... 
00:40:43	 
		 
00:40:44	He kind of saved my life.
		제 목숨을 살렸어요.
00:40:46	 
		 
00:40:46	Figuratively speaking, I hope.
		하나의 비유이길 바라. 
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:48	Yes. I mean, he wasn't...
		really there, but...
		네, 제 말은....
		크레이그가 진짜 거기 있던 건 아닌데, 
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:52	Now you can't decide what to do
		with the necklace he gave you
		옛 일을 회상하게 하기 때문에 
00:40:54	 
		 
00:40:54	because it reminds
		you of your past.
		그 목걸이를 어떻게 처분할지 모르겠나 보구나.
00:40:56	 
		 
00:40:59	You can try to forget it,
		잊으려고 해보거나 
00:41:00	 
		 
00:41:01	or you can learn
		to live with it.
		아니면 그걸 껴안고 사는 법을 배워야 해. 
00:41:03	 
		 
00:41:04	Yeah.
		네.
00:41:05	 
		 
00:41:09	Well?
		그래서요?
00:41:10	 
		 
00:41:11	"Well" what?
		그래서 뭐?
00:41:12	 
		 
00:41:13	What do you think I should do?
		Keep it or get rid of it?
		어떡해야 할까요? 버릴까요, 놔둘까요?
00:41:17	 
		 
00:41:23	Well, I think that's
		your call, Grace.
		네가 원하는대로 해야지, 그레이스.
00:41:25	 
		 
00:41:27	Don't you?
		그렇지 않니?
00:41:28	 
		 
00:41:30	Good night.
		잘 자라.
00:41:32	 
		 
00:41:32	Good night, Jane.
		제인씨도요.
