00:00:02	For over a century, I have lived in secret,
		한 세기를 걸쳐

00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	Until now. I know the risk,
		but I have to know her.
		위험하단걸 알지만
		그녀를 만나야 한다
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	Elena, she's a dead ringer for katherine.
		엘레나 말야. 캐더린과
		정말 똑닮았더군
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	Our love for katherine wasn't real, damon.
		캐더린에 대한 우리의
		사랑은 진심이 아녔어
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:11	I'm gonna bring her back.

		불러들일거야
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	I'm anna. Uh, jemy.

		우리 증조 할아버지가
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	A journal. He had written all of this
		일기를 보여주셨었는데, 거기엔
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	Creepy stuff about vampires.
		뱀파이어에 대한
		무서운 얘기들이 써있었어
00:00:18

		당신 차례에요
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Any sad relationship stories?
		슬픈 과거 얘기 없나요?
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	Fell in love, married young...
		사랑에 빠져
		어린 나이에 결혼했는데
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:24	Wifeied.
		아내가 세상을 떠났죠
00:00:26	 
		 
00:00:26	I've never been in your room before.
		네 방은 처음 와본다
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:30	Who am I you?
		난 너한테 누구냐고?
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	You are not katherine.
		넌 캐더린이 아냐
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:33	Why do I look like her?
		그럼 왜 닮은거야?
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	You were adopted.
		입양됐거든
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:48	Aah! How you doin' in there?
		괜찮니?
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:51	Stefan, who was that man in the road?
		스테판, 그 도로에
		있던 남자는 누구야?
00:00:54	 
		 
00:00:54	I don't know. Do you remember
		anything else about him?
		모르겠어
		다른건 기억 안나?
00:00:58	 
		 
00:00:58	I wish. I never really saw his face.
		그랬으면 좋았겠지
		얼굴도 제대로 못봤어
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:02	He was wearing a hoodie.
		후디를 입고 있었어
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	All I caremember is that there was
		these black boots coming towards me.
		기억나는 거라곤 검은색 부츠가
		내쪽으로 걸어왔다는 거야
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	I brought some vervain
		마편초를 좀 가져왔어
00:01:11	 
		 
00:01:11	For, um-- for you and jenna.
		너랑 제나 이모를 위해
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	And, um, I made this bracelet for jeremy,
		제레미랑 친구들한테 주라고
00:01:17	 
		 
00:01:17	Few extra on for friends.
		팔찌도 만들었고
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	You can put it in jewelry,
		네 보석류에 넣거나
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:21	Or you can even put it in food or drink,
		음식이나 음료에
		넣어도 되
00:01:24	 
		 
00:01:24	But as long as it's in you or on you,
		몸속에 있거나
		차고 있으면
00:01:27	 
		 
00:01:27	A vampire cann control you.
		뱀파이어는 널
		조종하지 못해
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:29	Wow. So mucho remember.
		와. 기억할게 많네
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	I know, but there's another vampire in tow
		하지만 미스틱 폴스에
		또다른 뱀파이어가 있어
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	So until we find out who
		it is and what he wants,
		누구인지 뭘 원하는지
		알아내기 전까지
00:01:38	 
		 
00:01:38	We have to be careful.
		조심해야돼
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:50	Hey.

		정말 괜찮은 에세이야
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	Your thoughts are clear,
		and your argument is well laid out.
		생각이 명백하고
		주장도 잘 배열되었어
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:24	It's just, uh, you don't actually

00:03:25	 
		 
00:03:26	Think the are vampires in mystic falls.
		미스틱 폴스에 뱀파이어가
		있다고 생각하진 않지?
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	No. I mean, I think
		statistically there's been
		네. 통계적으로는
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	More animal attacks, mystious deaths, uh,
		동물의 습격과

00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:34	People gone missing,
		more than any other place

00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	In the whole commonwealth of virginia.
		버지니아주에서
		제일 많이 증가 했지만요
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	It's conjecture,
		추측이긴 한데
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:40	But creative, which is why you got the "a."

		A를 준거야
00:03:43

00:03:45	In the whole conspiracy theory of it all.
		사로잡히진 않을거야
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:47	Ah, I won't.
		저도요
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:48	All right.

00:04:35	Your friendship is important to me.
		너와의 우정은 중요하거든
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	Why aryou being so mushy?
		왜 이리 감상적이 됐어
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	Because you've been avoiding me,
		날 피해 다녔잖아
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:42	And I wanted you to know that whatever
		네가 알아줬음 좋겠어
00:04:43

		맷하고 무슨 일이
		진행중이건 괜찮다고
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:47	I was gonna talk to you about that.
		그 얘기하려고 했었어
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	I was,
		원래는
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	But there's just not much to say.
		하지만 할 얘기가 별로 없다
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	We've hung out a couple times.
		몇 번 같이 어울렸어
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	That's it, but...

00:04:59	I just feel like we've peed as friends.
		우리 친구 사이가
		발전한 것 같아
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:04	This is weird.
		이상하다
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	I shouldn't be talking you about this.
		이런 얘기해선 안되는데
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	It's weird. It's weird, ght?
		이상해. 맞지?
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:09	It's a little weird, but--heh.
		좀 이상하지만
00:05:10	 
		 
00:05:10	If it's what you and matt want,
		then it's not about me.
		너랑 맷이 원한다면
		난 신경쓰지 마
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:14	But it's all about you.
		너도 신경써야 해
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:17	Matt's not over you, and we all know it.

00:05:19	I'm with stefan w.
		난 스테판하고 사귀잖아

00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	Yeah.
		맞아요
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	So what's the plan? Cook line?

00:05:54	 
		 
00:05:58	I n't believe you're adopted.
		입양이 됐다니
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:00	I never saw that coming.
		And it gets weirder.
		- 예상 못했어
		- 더 이상한 건
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	I looked at my birth certificate.
		내 출생신고서를 봤는데
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	It lists miranda and grayson
		gilbert as my birthparents.
		미란다 그레이슨 길버트가
		내 친부모로 나와 있어
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	None oit makes any sense.
		이해가 전혀 안돼
00:06:07	 
		 
00:06:07	Which is why you should ask jenna.
		그러니까 제나 이모한테
		물어봐야 해
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:10	First of all, the elena I know
		우선 내가 아는 엘레나는
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	Would always want the
		real truth, good or bad.
		좋은 싫든 늘 진실을
		알아내고 싶어했거든
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	And second of all?
		두번째는?
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:16	You just found out your
		boyfriend is a vampire,
		남자친구가 뱀파이어라는걸
		알게 되었는데
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	So unless your birthparents are aliens...
		네 친부모가
		외계인이 아닌 이상
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:22	How bad could it be?
		얼마나 안좋겠어?
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store.
		봐, 나 옷가게에 가야해
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	My outfit for the dance is
		severely lacking accessories.
		내 댄스파티 의상에
		악세사리가 부족하거든
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	Ok, I'll pay the bill.
		내가 돈 낼게
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:31	Ok. Bye.
		잘 있어
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	Bye.
		안녕
00:06:33	 
		 
00:06:35	What do you want from me?
		나한테 뭘 원하는 거죠?
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	I think we need a fresh start.
		깨끗하게 시작하고 싶어
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	You tried to kill me.
		날 죽이려 했잖아요
00:06:41	 
		 
00:06:41	But I didn't, and if I wanted to,
		I would have.
		죽이진 않았잖아
		원했다면 이미 죽었을걸
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	Does that not count for anything?
		아무 눈치 못채겠어?
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	You know, I can start fires with my mind.
		마음만 먹으면
		불을 피울수도 있어요
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	Fires kill vampires, right?
		뱀파이어는 화상으로 죽기도 하죠?
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:50	Just stay the hell away from me.
		내 근처엔 얼씬도 말라구요
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	Everything ok over here?

		날 아는지도 몰랐어요
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	I always know a pretty face.

00:07:58	 
		 
00:08:08	Why me? What does he want with me,
		왜 나인거지?
		나한테 뭘 원하길래
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	A-and if he's trying to kill me,
		그리고 날 죽이려 한다면
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	Then why call first?

00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	That's because we're predators, ena.

00:08:33	 
		 
00:08:33	It's a-- it's a sort of compass,

		내리는 사람으로 생각했거든
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	Well, I do that, too,
		그러기도 하지
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:31	But if you want something done right,

00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	You gotta do it yourself.
		직접 해야 돼
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:40	You know, I just like

00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	I just meant that I

00:16:21	Well, he gets points fothat.
		1점 추가군
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	Did he say what he wanted?
		원하는걸 말했어?
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	No. He was too busy trying to kill me.
		아뇨. 날 죽이려들기 바빴죠
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	And you have no idea who this is?
		누군지 전혀 모르고?
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:28	No.
		응
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:31	Don't look at me like that.
		그런 식으로 쳐다보지 마
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	I told you we had company.
		동지가 있을거랬잖아
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	You think there's more than one?
		한명 이상일 것 같아요?
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	We don't know.
		몰라
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:38	Damon, he was invited in.
		데이먼, 초대를 받았어
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:45	Then we go get him tonight.
		그럼 오늘밤 잡자
00:16:48	 
		 
00:16:48	You up for it?
		도와줄수 있지?
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	What do I have to do?
		뭘 해야하죠?
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	Let your boyfriend take you to the dance.
		남자친구가 파티
		데려가게 만들어
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:54	Wel see who shows up.
		누가 나타나나 보자고
00:16:55	 
		 
00:16:55	That's a bad idea.
		좋은 생각이 아냐
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	Till we get him, this house isn't safe.
		그 놈을 잡기 전까진
		집안은 안전하지 않아
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:58	For anyone who lives in it.
		이 집안 사람들은 다 말야
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:03	It's worth a shot.
		시도해볼만 해
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:06	I'll do it.
		할게요
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:14	I'll be with the o of you. I'll be safe.
		너랑 같이 있으면
		안전할거야
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:49	Alaric.
		알라릭
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:52	Hey, look at you.
		당신 좀 봐요
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	I figured I'd stand out
		less if I dressed up.
		꾸미고 오면 덜 튈 것 같았어요
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	Heh heh. Liar.
		거짓말쟁이
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance.
		70년대 댄스파티라면
		사족을 못쓰거든요
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	I went to school here, you know.
		이 학교를 나왔어요
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:03	They do the sixts and seventies, too, fyi.
		그때도 60, 70년대를
		주제로 한 댄스파티가 있었죠
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	Oh. Can't wait.
		기대 되는군요
00:18:08	 
		 
00:18:08	Can I get you a drink?
		음료라도 한잔 드릴까요?
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	I hear the punch is real boss.
		여기 음료가
		정말 맛있다던데
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	Heh.
		 
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:19	Having fun?
		즐거운 시간 보내고 있니?
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	No, but this took about 2 hours,
		아니, 하지만
		2시간 걸려 꾸몄으니
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:24	So I'm at least staying half of that.
		꾸민 시간 반은
		버티고 있는 중이지
00:18:27	 
		 
00:18:27	What's damon doing here?
		데이먼은 뭐하러 온거야?
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:32	He wanted to come.
		오고 싶어하더라
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	I promise. He'll behave.
		약속했어
		조심히 행동할거야
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:36	So what is this, like, a threesome now,
		뭐 양다리라도 걸치는거야?
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	You and the salvatore brothers?
		너랑 살바토어 형제끼리?
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:39	No, but if I'm gonna be with stefan,
		아니, 스테판과
		사귈 거라면
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	Then I have to learn to tolerate damon.
		데이먼 참는 법도
		배워야 하잖아
00:18:43	 
		 
00:18:43	It's not like I can kill him.
		죽일 수도 없는 일이고
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	There's a thought.
		괜찮은 생각인데
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:46	Mmm. I'll help.
		내가 도울게
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:49	I'm really starting to
		see a change in jeremy.
		제레미가 변하는게
		보이기 시작해요
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	Finally.
		마침내 말이죠
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	Uh, losing someone you love so suddenly,
		사랑하는 사람을
		갑자기 잃게 되면
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	The, uh--the trauma and the grief ther
		마음의 상처와
		슬픔이 남죠
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Are some of the tougher
		things 'll face in life.
		살면서 직면하기 힘든 일이죠
00:19:01	 
		살면서 직면하기 힘든 일이죠
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:02	From someone who knows.
		경험에서 우러나온 말이군요
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	You have no idea what happened?
		어떻게 된건지 모르시나요?
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	That's the hard part, not knowing.
		그게 제일 힘들어요
		모르는거 말이죠
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	Is it ok to talk about your wife?
		아내분 얘기해도 괜찮나요?
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	Heh. There's not much to talk about.
		얘기할 것도 별로 없어요
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Th must be impossible to deal with,
		not having any answers.
		참 감당하기 어렵겠어요
		아무런 해답도 없으니 말이죠
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	I'd be lying to you if I told you
		it didn't keep me up at night.
		그 생각으로 밤샌적 없다고
		한다면 거짓말 하는 걸거에요
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	Wondering why, by who,
		그 범인이 누군지와
		이유를 말이죠
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:28	Maybe one day.
		언젠간 알게 될거에요
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:30	Hope so.
		그러길 빌어요
00:19:31	 
		 
00:19:34	Hope so.
		정말로요
00:19:36

		되는거 아니야?
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	No. Doesn't work that way.
		아니. 그렇지 않아
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:59	See him anywhere?
		뭐 보이는 사람 없어?
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	Not unless he has a pompadour.
		올백머리 빼곤
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	Heh. Wow. Was not one of
		the better fashion trends.
		그건 그 당시 유행이 아녔는데
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	Come on. I'm sure you
		looked great back then.
		그때 정말
		멋있었을거 같은데
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	Are there pictures?
		사진 없어?
00:21:10	 
		 
00:21:10	No. Burned. Buried.

		내 마음속에는
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	Between "american bandstand," "grease."
		'아메리카 밴드스탠드'와
		'그리스'가 떠오르는데
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.
		대학교 스웨터와
		밀크셰이크 말야
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	Well, that and, you know, mccarthyism
		매카시즘과 인종 차별주의

00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	There were poodle skirts.

00:22:01	 
		 
00:22:01	I took matters into my own hands.
		내 스스로 와야겠다 싶었지
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	You're doin' that thing again.

		그래
00:22:11

00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:27	I'm his legal guardian,

		보호자로 동반하게 됐죠
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	I hear he's very bright,
		명석하다고 들었는데
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	Not that I've had a
		chance to see for myself.
		직접 만나보진 못했어요
00:23:34	 
		 
00:23:34	Well, his attendance
		record's a little spotty.
		출석률은 조금 저조하죠
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:37	Family drama.
		집안 일이 많아서
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:39	Arents?

00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:00	Look, it was nice meeting you.
		만나서 반가웠습니다
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:03	You, too.

00:24:16	Tonight was so much better on paper.
		오늘밤은 책속에서나
		더 재미있었어
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:18	Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself.
		낙담한 것 뿐야
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:20	Go and tk to him.
		가서 말해봐
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:21	Be bold and fearless.
		대담하고 뻔뻔하게 나오라구
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:23	Yeah, this coming from the girl who's
		그래. 바텐더를 눈으로

00:24:42	I'm proving something to my friend.
		친구한테 증명하려구요
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	Oh, yeah? What's that?
		뭘?
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	That you don't have to sit around and
		wait for a guy to come up to you.
		앉아서 남자가 다가오기만을
		기다릴 필요 없단 걸요
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:48	Does that mean that you're
		asking me out on a date?
		그럼 나한테
		데이트 신청하겠단 소리야?
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:51	Does that mean you want me to?
		그러고 싶단 뜻인가요?
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	Well, what did you have in mind?
		어떤 계획이 있는데?
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:57	Do you like karaoke?
		노래방 좋아해요?
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:59	No.
		아니
00:25:00	 
		 
00:25:00	But I would really like
		to go on a date with you.
		하지만 너와 정말
		데이트하고 싶어
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:14	Seriously?
		진짜?

00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:20	Do you need something?
		뭐 필요하니?
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	Are you mad at me or something?
		나한테 화라도 났어?
00:25:24	 
		 
00:25:24	No, care. I'm not mad. I--
		아니. 화 안 났어
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:25	Well, then why are you being so weird?
		왜 이상하게 굴어?
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	I'm not. I'm working.
		아냐. 일하느라
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:27	You're avoiding.

		아니. 닦아야 할 테이블이 있어서
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:31	You know, that's the kind of thing
		돈 좀 벌자고 한물간
		운동선수들이 하는 일이거든

		이 학교 안 다니잖아
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:44	You know, you don't have to help.
		도울 필요 없어
00:25:45	 
		 
00:25:45	Oh, I don't mi.

00:26:03	 
		 
00:26:03	Wait. Why did you give it to him?
		잠깐. 왜 준거야?
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	Because he wanted to read it.
		읽고 싶으시대서
00:26:07	 
		 
00:26:07	You know, you shouldn't be
		giving that to just anybody.
		그런건 아무한테나 주면 안돼
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:10	But I should give it to you?
		너한텐 왜 줘야 하는데?

00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:18	What's the big deal with the stupid journal?
		그 멍청한 일기장이
		뭐가 대수라고?
00:26:21	 
		 
00:26:23	Your eye.
		네 눈이..
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:26	Um, there's something in it.

00:26:28	Forget it. I gotta go.
		됐어. 그냥 갈게
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:39	Maybe he's not gonna show.
		안 나타날 건가봐
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	You mean we did all this
		dancing for nothing?
		춤을 춘게 그럼
		헛수고였다고?
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	Ahh. The horror.

		여기 있기로 결정했지
00:26:52	 
		 
00:26:52	I officially signed up for it,
		내가 시작한 일인데
00:26:53	 
		 
00:26:53	So I don't wanna hear

00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	Come on. One move?

00:27:21	Now you remember that,
		그거 기억해
00:27:22

00:27:51	She looks like katherine.

00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:52	She's not katherine.
		캐더린이 아냐
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	Ok, katherine is in the tomb.
		캐더린은 묘지 밑에 있지
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	I know, but until we open that tomb,
		알아. 하지만
		묘지를 열기까지
00:27:57

00:28:12	Just let me have my fun.

00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:37	I got a job as a teacher.
		이 학교에 배정을 받아서
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	Do you know what I am?
		You're my student's brother.
		- 나의 정체를 아는가?
		- 내 제자의 형이지
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:41	Is everything you're telling me the truth?
		넌 진실만을 얘기하는가?
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	Yes.
		그래
00:33:44	 
		 
00:33:44	Then forget we had this conversation.

00:34:12	That was emily's, right?
		에밀리 꺼였지?
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:14	That's what you need to reverse the spell.
		주문을 뒤집으려면
		그게 필요한거고
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:17	When the founding families burned her,
		they took her things,
		설립자 가족들이 그녀를
		화형시키고 물건을 뺏었는데
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	And you were hoping that dad's
		journal would tell you where it is.

00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:23	Look at u puttin' the pieces together.

00:34:26	Good for you.

00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	I was half-right.
		내가 반 정도 옳았어
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	Well, it's out there now.
		이젠 어딘가에 있지
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:33	Let the games begin.

00:34:37	Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no dou.
		숨겨둔 꿍꿍이가 있겠지
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:39	No. Nothing hidden about it.
		아무것도 없어
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	No lies. No deception.
		거짓말도 속임수도
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:42	I'm there when you open up that tomb,
		형이 묘지를 열때
		같이 있을거야
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	You and katherine go,
		형하고 캐더린이
		사라져 주고
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	And the other 26 vampires die.
		다른 26명의 뱀파이어는
		죽어야 하지
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:49	If I agree I'll help you.
		- 동의하면?
		- 도와줄게
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	Why should I trust you?
		Because I'm your brother.
		- 왜 널 믿어야 하지?
		- 동생이니까
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:53	No, that's not gonna cut it.
		아니, 그걸론 부족해
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:55	Because I want you gone.
		형이 사라지길 바라거든
00:34:57	 
		 
00:35:04	Ok.
		좋아
00:35:06	 
		 
00:35:12	Looki said something stupid.

		even taing about you.
		미안해, 하지만
		너에 대한게 아녔잖아
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	Yes, you were, caroline.

00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	Ben could easily be .
		나도 벤처럼 될 수 있다고
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:22	We're just alike.
		같은 처지인걸
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	That's not true.
		사실이 아냐
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	Are you seriouy mad about this?
		진짜 이 일로 화난거야?
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:27	Matt, you know me.
		맷, 넌 날 몰라
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	Ok, I say stupid things without thinking,
		난 생각 없이
		바보같은 말을 해
00:35:31	 
		 
00:35:31	And then I have to apologize
		and take it back, and...
		그리고 사과하고
		말을 취소하지
00:35:34	 
		 
00:35:34	I'm a terrible, awful person,
		but I'm rking on it.
		난 정말 끔찍한 인간이야
		하지만 노력중이라고
00:35:37	 
		 
00:35:37	Look, can we just not do this right now?
		지금은 이러지 말아줄래?
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	Ok.
		좋아
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	When do you get off?

00:35:46	It's nice, and it feels really good,
		기분이 좋아
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	And I know you wna take the next step.
		관계를 진전시키고 싶은거 알고
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:50	How do you know that?
		어떻게 알아?
00:35:51	 
		 
00:35:52	Have you even asked me?
		나한테 물어보기라도 했니?
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:54	I'm--I'm not over elena.
		난.. 엘레나를
		아직 못 잊었어
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:58	I mean, I don't know if I am,
		but if we go there,
		잊었는지도 모르지만
		우리가 사귀다가
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:02	Then it could mess things up,
		and we might lose this,
		일을 망치면
		이런 사이를 잃게 될거야
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:05	And this is the only good thi
		I've got going for me right now.
		지금 너와의 우정은
		유일하게 좋은 일이란 말야
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:08	So if it doesn't work,
		I'll just disappoint you
		잘 안되면
		널 실망시키게 되고
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	And hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.
		상처 줄텐데
		그러고 싶지 않아
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:16	Well, big problem, matt,
		큰 문제네, 맷
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:18	Because you took the next
		step all by yourself,
		왜냐면 너 혼자서
		관계를 진척시켰거든
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:21	And you played the whole
		thing out in your head,
		머리속에서 모든 일을
		상상 해놓고
00:36:23	 
		 
00:36:23	And you decided to bail
		before even giving it a shot.
		시도하기도 전에
		도망치기로 결심한거지
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:26	So this really great thing that we have,
		그러니까 우리가 가진
		이 멋진 우정
00:36:28	 
		 
00:36:28	Don't worry about losing it,
		잃는 걱정 하지 마
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:30	'cause it's already gone.
		이미 사라졌으니까
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:40	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	I needed that.
		이런 시간이 필요했어요
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	Well, thank you for--for coming.
		와줘서 고마워요
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	I--I really appreciate it.
		정말로 감사해요
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:45	You made the evening much more...
		저녁을 참..
00:36:48	 
		 
00:36:49	Well, you made it, period.
		잘 해내셨어요
00:36:52	 
		 
00:36:52	I'm glad I could help.
		도움이 되어 기쁘군요
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:54	And thank you for puttinup
		with all that wife talk.
		내가 아내 얘기하는거
		참고 들어준거 고맙구요
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:57	I--I gotta stop doin' that.
		그만 좀 해야겠어요
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:58	It doesn't bode well for dating.
		데이트 할 때는
		마이너스 요소잖아요
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:02	Is that what this was, a date?
		그럼 오늘 이게
		데이트였나요?
00:37:04	 
		 
00:37:04	No, definitely not a date.
		아뇨, 데이트는 아녔죠
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:06	Oh.
		 
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:07	But Friday...
		하지만 금요일날
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:08	You, me, and dinner and a movie,
		당신하고 제가
		저녁식사도 하고 영화도 보면서
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:11	That could be a date.
		데이트 하는 거에요
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:14	How 'bout it?
		어때요?
00:37:15	 
		 
00:37:15	Works for me.
		좋아요
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:17	Heh.
		 
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	Uh, you can talk about
		your wife all you want.
		원하면 아내 얘기
		실컷 하셔도 되요
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	It's gonna take time to heal.
		상처 치유하는데
		시간이 걸릴거에요
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:23	We should just be ourselves.
		그냥 자기 답게 행동하면 되죠
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:25	Still, I think I'll keep the
		isabelle talk to a minimum.
		이자벨 얘기는
		최소로 줄여야 겠네요
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:29	Isabelle?
		이자벨이라구요?
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:31	Yeah. That was her name.
		네. 아내 이름이었죠
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:32	Where was isabelle from?
		어디 출신이죠?
00:37:34	 
		 
00:37:34	Virginia. I mean, not too-
		-not too far from here, actually.
		버지니아요
		여기서 그리 멀지 않은 곳요
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:43	Caroline!
		캐롤라인?
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:45	Care, get in the truck.
		차에 타
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:53	What?
		뭐라고?
00:37:54	 
		 
00:38:03	This'll never work.
		잘 안될지 몰라
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:17	Doin' ok?
		괜찮아?
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:22	Is it weird if I say yes?
		괜찮다고 한다면 이상하나?
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:25	Is it true?
		사실이야?
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:26	I should feel more upset
		화가 난다거나
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:28	Or scared or something, but I...
		두렵거나 해야되는데..
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	Feel kind of exhilarated.
		들뜬 기분이야
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:33	It's the adrenaline.
		아드레날린 때문이야
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	You'll crash soon enough.
		곧 기진맥진 할거야
00:38:37	 
		 
00:38:37	Yeah, I gus.
		그렇겠지
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:40	I fought back tonight.
		오늘 맞서 싸웠어
00:38:42	 
		 
00:38:42	It felt good.
		기분 좋았어
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:43	I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
		싸울 일 없었으면 좋았을텐데
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:45	Still...
		그래도..
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:51	I need to tell you something,
		얘기하고 싶은게 있어
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:53	And I don't know how
		you're gonna feel about it.
		네가 어떻게 느낄지 모르겠고
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:58	What?
		뭔데?
00:38:59	 
		 
00:38:59	I told damon that I'd help
		him get into that tomb
		데이먼한테 묘지 여는 걸
		도와주겠다고 했어
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:04	To get katherine back.
		캐더린 되찾는거
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:05	But it was a lie.
		거짓말이야
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:07	I let him believe that he could trust me.
		날 믿어도 된다고
		믿게 만들었지
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:12	Well, then why would you be
		worried about telling me?
		그럼 왜 나한테
		말하는 걸 조마조마해?
00:39:15	 
		 
00:39:15	Because he can be very persuasive,
		형은 아주 설득을 잘해
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:17	And you two have bonded lately.
		최근에 둘이
		친해지기도 했고
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	hat doesn't mean I trust him.
		그를 믿는단 뜻은 아니지
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:23	It's gonna take a lot more than
		just a road trip and a rescue
		로드트립을 하고
		날 구해줬대도
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:28	For me to forget who damon
		is and everytng he's done.
		데이먼의 정체와 그가 한 짓을
		쉽게 잊지 못할거야
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:33	I don't wanna be his enemy, elena,
		난 적이 되고 싶지 않아
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	But I can't let him do it.
		그대로 둘 수 없어
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:37	Then don't,
		그럼 막아
00:39:39	 
		 
00:39:39	And I'll help you, whatever it takes.
		내가 도울게
		무슨 일이든
00:39:42	 
		 
00:39:43	Ok?
		괜찮겠지?
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:46	Ok.
		응
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:49	Come here.
		이리 와
00:39:51	 
		 
00:40:24	Don't sneak up on me.
		몰래 다가오지 좀 마
00:40:26	 
		 
00:40:27	You love it.
		좋아하면서
00:40:29	 
		 
00:40:30	Where's noah?
		노아는 어디있어?
00:40:32	 
		 
00:40:32	His obsession got the best of him,
		집착 때문에
		되려 당했지
00:40:34	 
		 
00:40:34	And so did the salvatore brothers.
		살바토어 형제들처럼
00:40:35	 
		 
00:40:35	They killed him?
		죽였어?
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:37	Tortured and staked.
		고문하고
		찔러 죽였어
00:40:38	 
		 
00:40:38	You're not very upset.
		화 별로 안난 눈치네
00:40:40	 
		 
00:40:40	I warned him, ben,
		전에 경고했어
00:40:41	 
		 
00:40:41	And he was just gonna
		screw everythingp anyway.
		어짜피 망칠 거였는걸
00:40:43	 
		 
00:40:43	Let's be honest. He wasn't exactlan asset.
		솔직하게 말하자
		쓸만한 인재는 아녔잖아
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:47	How'd you do?
		넌 어땠어?
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:48	Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me.
		마녀가 나한테
		완전 넘어갔어
00:40:50	 
		 
00:40:51	Did you get the journal?
		일기 가져왔니?
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:52	No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.
		아니, 하지만 어디있는지 알아
		꼭 가져 올거야
