00:00:00	Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
		지난 이야기
00:00:01	 
		For over a century, I have lived in secret.
		 
		한 세기를 걸쳐
		비밀을 간직했다
00:00:03	 
		Until now.
		 
		여태까지
00:00:04	 
		I know the risk, but I have to know her.
		 
		위험한 건 알지만
		그녀를 알아야만 한다
00:00:06	 
		What are you?
		 
		정체가 뭐야?
00:00:08	 
		I'm a vampire.
		 
		뱀파이어야
00:00:09	 
		Tell me about your ex, Katherine.
		 
		네 전 여친
		캐더린에 대해 말해줘
00:00:11	 
		You must be Elena.
		 
		네가 엘레나구나
00:00:12	 
		How do we look exactly alike?
		 
		우린 어째서 닮은거죠?
00:00:14	 
		The Lockwoods are werewolves.
		 
		락우드가 사람들은
		늑대인간이야
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	Tell me what triggers the curse!
		저주를 일으키는
		원인이 뭔지 말해줘!
00:00:17	 
		You have to kill somebody!
		 
		사람을 죽여야 해!
00:00:18	 
		 
00:00:18	Paralyzed from the waist down.
		하반신마비
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:21	And dead.
		죽었네
00:00:22	 
		Matt failed. I can't.
		 
		맷이 실패하면 안돼
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:27	Tyler, what's happening?
		타일러, 무슨 일이야?
00:00:28	 
		- Get away! Get away! - What's happening?!
		 
		- 저리 비켜!
		- 어떻게 된거냐고?
00:00:33	 
		We were stupid, sneaking around, thinking we weren't gonna get caught.
		 
		몰래 만나며 들키지 않을거라
		생각했던 우리가 바보같았어
00:00:36	 
		But it's over.
		 
		이젠 끝났어
00:00:37	 
		You need me. Elena's in danger.
		 
		내가 필요해
		엘레나는 위험하다구
00:00:38	 
		She's the doppelganger. She needs to be protected.
		 
		내 도플갱어야
		보호받아야 해
00:00:41	 
		Then I'll protect her.
		 
		그럼 내가 보호하지
00:00:42	 
		Please, Damon.
		 
		제발, 데이먼
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:45	No!
		안돼!
00:00:47	 
		 
00:01:13	Where is she?
		그녀는 어디 있지?
00:01:15	 
		In the trunk. I did exactly what you said.
		 
		트렁크 안에요
		당신이 말한대로 했습니다
00:01:18	 
		Good. Put her in the back.
		 
		좋아
		뒤에다가 실어
00:01:21	 
		 
00:01:43	Thank you for your help.
		도와줘서 고맙네
00:01:44	 
		Is there anything else?
		 
		달리 도와드릴 일이라도?
00:01:46	 
		One more thing. Come closer. Please.
		 
		한가지 더 있지
		가까이 와 봐
00:01:49	 
		 
00:01:53	Closer.
		더 가까이
00:01:54

		The Vampire Diaries 2x08
		Rose
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:29	Yo, Elena!
		엘레나!
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:48	So, Sarah attacks Tyler, and he pushed her away,
		새라가 타일러를 공격해서
		그녀를 밀었는데
00:02:51	 
		And she tripped, and she fell, and she hit her head.
		 
		발을 헛디뎌서 넘어지고
		머리를 다쳤다
00:02:54	 
		Does Matt remember anything?
		 
		맷은 기억하는 거 없대?
00:02:56	 
		Mmm, he thinks he blacked out.
		 
		필름이 끊겼대
00:02:58	 
		Mmm. But I think--
		 
		하지만 내 생각엔..
00:03:00	 
		I think they were both compelled by Katherine.
		 
		캐더린이 둘한테
		주문을 걸은 것 같아
00:03:02	 
		That's why I covered for Tyler and said it was an accident.
		 
		그래서 타일러 대신에
		사고였다고 둘러대는 거지
00:03:05	 
		Yeah, I don't understand that. The guy's a tool.
		 
		그래, 이해가 안가지
		그 녀석은 못된놈이란 말야
00:03:07	 
		Well, gee, duh.
		 
		무슨 소리 하셔
00:03:08	 
		Tyle's getting blamed for Sarah's death
		 
		타일러 때문에
		죽은걸 알게 되면
00:03:10	 
		just opens up questions that he can't answer.
		 
		답할 수 없는
		질문만 많아진다구
00:03:13	 
		And do you really think it's a good idea
		 
		어머니한테
		늑대인간이라고 말하는게
00:03:15	 
		for him to tell his mom he's a werewolf?
		 
		좋은 생각이라고 생각해?
00:03:18	 
		Well, no.
		 
		아니
00:03:19	 
		And that werewolf road leads straight to vampire boulevard.
		 
		늑대인간 얘기를 시작하면
		뱀파이어까지 갈테니
00:03:22	 
		I thought I was thinking fast on my feet.
		 
		나도 머리 꽤 쓰지
00:03:24	 
		Where's your mom?
		 
		어머니는 어디 계셔?
00:03:25	 
		Leading the search party for Aimee Bradley.
		 
		에이미 브래들리
		수색팀을 지휘중이지
00:03:28	 
		They haven't found her body yet.
		 
		아직 시체를 못 찾았대
00:03:29	 
		Oh, teens today and their underage drinking. Tragic.
		 
		10대들의 불법 음주라
		참 비극적이군
00:03:33	 
		Wait. Did you see Tyler's eyes turn yellow?
		 
		잠깐. 타일러 눈이
		노랗게 변한거 봤어?
00:03:35	 
		More gold with amber highlights.
		 
		호박색 빛이 감도는
		금색이었네요
00:03:39	 
		Can he turn into a wolf now?
		 
		이제 늑대인간으로
		변할 수 있는거야?
00:03:41	 
		Only on a full moon,
		 
		보름달이 뜨면
00:03:42	 
		but now he has increased strength and who knows what else.
		 
		지금은 힘이 커지는 중인데
		어찌될지 누가 알겠어
00:03:45	 
		I wonder what Mason told him.
		 
		메이슨이 뭐라고 했을까
00:03:46	 
		Does he know about us?
		 
		우리 정체를 알아?
00:03:48	 
		Hey. What'd you tell him?
		 
		넌 뭐라고 말했는데?
00:03:50	 
		Nothing, really.
		 
		아무것도.. 말 안했어
00:03:52	 
		I--I don't think he knows much of anything.
		 
		뭐 아는 거 없는 것 같아
00:03:55	 
		He seemed really freaked out, and honestly...
		 
		정말 놀란 눈치였어
		사실은..
00:03:58	 
		 
00:04:00	I felt kinda bad for him.
		참 안타까웠어
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:03	He's gotta know something.
		뭔가 아는게 틀림 없어
00:04:05	 
		All right. I'll ask him.
		 
		좋아. 가서 물어보자
00:04:08	 
		No, you won't, Caroline.
		 
		아니, 그럴 수 없어
00:04:09	 
		He cannot know about us.
		 
		우리를 알면 안돼
00:04:11	 
		A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
		 
		늑대인간에 물리면
		뱀파이어는 죽는다고
00:04:13	 
		So don't be his friend. Do you understand me?
		 
		그러니까 친구가 되지 마
		알아들었니?
00:04:15	 
		I understand.
		 
		알았어
00:04:18	 
		I'm late for school.
		 
		학교 늦었다
00:04:20	 
		Right.
		 
		좋아
00:04:23	 
		If you want to drop the hint to your mom,
		 
		엄마한테 힌트 주고 싶으면
00:04:25	 
		Aimee's body is at the bottom of the ravine with a cracked spine.
		 
		에이미 시체는
		계곡 골짜기 아래에 있단다
00:04:27	 
		Might save your mom some time.
		 
		수색 시간을 좀 덜어줄지도
00:04:29	 
		 
00:05:23	Hey, Jeremy.
		제레미
00:05:24	 
		Look, Elena's gotta let me know
		 
		누나한테 둘러댈 핑계 필요하면
00:05:25	 
		if I'm supposed to cover for her.
		 
		미리 알려달라고 하세요
00:05:26	 
		I mean, Jenna's cool with the two of you,
		 
		이모도 둘의 사이를
		괜찮게 생각해요
00:05:27	 
		but you guys are pushing it.
		 
		하지만 이건 너무하잖아요
00:05:29	 
		- What are you talking about? - You and Elena.
		 
		- 무슨 말이니?
		- 형하고 엘레나요
00:05:30	 
		Look, I'm glad you guys are back together,
		 
		둘이 화해한 거 다행인데
00:05:32	 
		- But if she's gonna sleep over-- - Wait, wait.
		 
		- 집에 안 들어올거면
		- 잠깐만..
00:05:34	 
		Hold on a minute. We're not back together.
		 
		잠깐만
		우리 화해 안했다
00:05:37	 
		Wait. She didn't-- she didn't stay at your place last night?
		 
		잠깐.. 어젯밤에
		집에 안 왔니?
00:05:40	 
		No. I mean, I saw her at the party, but that was it.
		 
		파티 때 봤지만
		그게 다였어
00:05:42	 
		She didn't sleep over.
		 
		우리 집에 있지 않았어
00:05:44	 
		'cause her bed hadn't been slept in,
		 
		침대에 자고 간 흔적도 없고
00:05:45	 
		And Mrs. Lockwood said that her car was still in the driveway.
		 
		락우드 여사님이 그러길
		차가 아직도 주차장에 있었대요
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:50	Where is she, then?
		그럼 어디 있는거죠?
00:05:53	 
		 
00:06:14	Please.
		제발
00:06:16	 
		 
00:06:30	- What do you want? - Shh.
		- 뭘 원하는거죠?
		- 쉿
00:06:34	 
		- Please, I'm hurt. - I know.
		 
		- 아프다구요
		- 알아
00:06:37	 
		Uhh. Just a taste.
		 
		한 방울만
00:06:39	 
		- Aah! Aah! - Trevor!
		 
		트레버!
00:06:41	 
		Control yourself.
		 
		자제해
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:47	Buzz kill.
		흥을 깨는군
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:51	What do you want with me?
		뭘 원하시는 거죠?
00:06:52	 
		My god, you look just like her.
		 
		세상에
		정말 똑닮았잖아
00:06:55	 
		But I'm not. Please, whatever you want--
		 
		하지만 난 아녜요
		뭘 원하시든..
00:06:57	 
		- Be quiet. - But I'm not Katherine.
		 
		- 조용히 해
		- 난 캐더린이 아녜요
00:07:00	 
		My name is Elena Gilbert. You don't have to do this.
		 
		엘레나 길버트에요
		이럴 필요 없어요
00:07:03	 
		I know who you are. I said be quiet.
		 
		네가 누군지 안다
		조용히 하랬지
00:07:06	 
		What do you want?
		 
		뭘 원하는거죠?
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:10	I want you to be quiet.
		네가 조용히 하길 원해
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:20	This has Katherine written all over it.
		캐더린 짓이 틀림 없어
00:07:21	 
		Katherine's in the tomb.
		 
		무덤 안에 있다구
00:07:22	 
		Trust me. I'm the one that shut her in.
		 
		날 믿어
		그녀를 가둔게 바로 나야
00:07:24	 
		- Did you? - Did I what, Stefan?
		 
		- 정말?
		- 뭘?
00:07:25	 
		Well, I know the hold that Katherine has on you.
		 
		캐더린이 형을
		갖고 노는걸 안다구
00:07:27	 
		She's in the tomb.
		 
		무덤에 있어
00:07:28	 
		Period. End of story.
		 
		그렇게 끝났어
00:07:31	 
		But she did say something to me
		 
		하지만 가두기 전에
00:07:33	 
		right before I shut her in.
		 
		뭐라고 말을 하더군
00:07:35	 
		I thought she was lying.
		 
		거짓말인줄 알았는데
00:07:37	 
		What did she say?
		 
		뭐라고 했는데
00:07:39	 
		Elena's in danger.
		 
		엘레나가 위험하다구
00:07:40	 
		What, and you didn't think you should ask her to elaborate?
		 
		잘 설명하라고
		말 안했어?
00:07:42	 
		Everything she says is a lie.
		 
		캐더린이 하는 말은
		다 거짓말인걸
00:07:44	 
		How am I supposed to know if she's gonna start spouting off the truth?
		 
		사실을 고백하기 시작하는 걸
		내가 어떻게 알겠어?
00:07:46	 
		We have to go talk to her.
		 
		가서 얘기하자
00:07:47	 
		No, no. Let me tell you how that's gonna go.
		 
		아니, 어떻게 할지는 내가 말하지
00:07:48	 
		We're gonna go ask her for help.
		 
		가서 도움을 요청할거야
00:07:49	 
		She's gonna negotiate her release,
		 
		해방해주는 조건으로
		협상하는 거야
00:07:50	 
		which we're gonna be dumb enough to give her,
		 
		그럼 바보같이
		풀어주게 될거고
00:07:52	 
		and then she's gonna get out and kill us.
		 
		밖으로 나와서
		우릴 죽일거라고
00:07:53	 
		- That's exactly what she wants. - I don't really care.
		 
		- 바로 그걸 원하지
		- 상관 안 해
00:07:56	 
		Bad idea, Stefan.
		 
		나쁜 생각이야
00:07:57	 
		It's Elena.
		 
		엘레나 일이라구
00:07:59	 
		 
00:08:11	Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:08:12	 
		Hey. How are you doing?
		 
		타일러
		잘 지냈니?
00:08:15	 
		- Not good. - How's your mom?
		 
		- 별로
		- 어머니는?
00:08:16	 
		My mom said that she was pretty freaked out
		 
		우리 엄마가 그러길
		새라 일 때문에
00:08:18	 
		about everything that happened with sarah.
		 
		정말 놀라셨다던데
00:08:21	 
		How did you know?
		 
		어떻게 알아?
00:08:24	 
		What do you mean?
		 
		무슨 말이야?
00:08:25	 
		About me.
		 
		나에 관해서
00:08:27	 
		How did you know?
		 
		어떻게 알아냈니?
00:08:28	 
		Know what? That you were upset?
		 
		뭘 안다고?
		네가 화낸거?
00:08:31	 
		I thought I was doing a good thing by covering for you.
		 
		너 대신 둘러대준거
		잘하는 거라 생각했는데
00:08:35	 
		That's not what I'm talking about.
		 
		그 말이 아냐
00:08:37	 
		Look, it was an accident.
		 
		있지, 그건 사고였어
00:08:39	 
		Ok? And I've gotta run.
		 
		응? 나 가봐야겠다
00:08:41	 
		Just please don't blame yourself.
		 
		제발 자책하지 말아줘
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:47	How's it go?
		어떻게 됐어?
00:08:48	 
		Still pass out.
		 
		아직 기절 중이야
00:08:49	 
		You didn't touch her, did you?
		 
		너 건들지 않았지?
00:08:50	 
		Give me some credit.
		 
		날 그렇게 못 믿어?
00:08:52	 
		So you called him?
		 
		그 분한테 전화했어?
00:08:53	 
		No, Il called one of his contacts. You know how this works.
		 
		아니, 그분 지인한테 연락할거야
		어떤식으로 처리되는지 알잖아
00:08:57	 
		Look, Did you or did you not get the message to Elijah?
		 
		엘라이자한테
		메세지 전달했어?
00:09:01	 
		- They say he got it. - Wonderful. And what?
		 
		- 그들은 전달했다고 했어
		- 잘됐네. 그리고 나선?
00:09:04	 
		So, that's it, Trevor.
		 
		끝이야, 트레버
00:09:06	 
		He either got it, or he didn't.
		 
		메세지를 전달 받았거나
		못 받은 거겠지
00:09:07	 
		We just have to wait.
		 
		그냥 기다려야 해
00:09:08	 
		Look, it's not too late.
		 
		늦지 않았어
00:09:09	 
		We can leave her here.
		 
		여기 두고 가자
00:09:10	 
		We don't have to go through with this.
		 
		이런 일을
		겪어낼 필요 없다고
00:09:12	 
		I'm sick of running.
		 
		난 도망치는데 지쳤어
00:09:14	 
		Yeah? Well, running keeps us from dying.
		 
		도망치지 않으면
		죽게 될거라구
00:09:17	 
		Elijah is old school.
		 
		엘라이자는 고지식해
00:09:18	 
		If he accepts our deal, we're free.
		 
		우리 협상을 받아들이면
		자유의 몸이 된다구
00:09:21	 
		you!
		 
		너!
00:09:23	 
		 
00:09:25	There's nothing around here for miles.
		이 주변은 다 허허벌판이야
00:09:27	 
		If you think you're getting out of this house,
		 
		이 집에서 도망칠 수 있다고 생각하면
00:09:28	 
		you're tragically wrong. Understand?
		 
		정말 잘못 아는거야
		알았어?
00:09:31	 
		Who's Elijah?
		 
		엘라이자는 누구죠?
00:09:33	 
		He's your worst nightmare.
		 
		네가 상상할 수 있는
		최악의 공포지
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:38	I can't undo the tomb spell, Stefan,
		무덤의 주문을
		깰 수 없어
00:09:40	 
		even if I wanted to.
		 
		내가 원해도
00:09:42	 
		It took both me and my grams to do it the first time.
		 
		처음에 풀었을 때
		할머니와 나 두명이 필요했어
00:09:45	 
		All right, but I can open the door, though, right?
		 
		하지만 내가
		문을 열수는 있는거지?
00:09:46	 
		I could talk to her?
		 
		얘기는 할 수 있겠지?
00:09:47	 
		Yeah, but Damon's right.
		 
		응, 하지만 데이먼이 맞아
00:09:49	 
		She's not gonna tell you anything,
		 
		아무것도 말 안할거야
00:09:51	 
		not without something in return.
		 
		답례가 없는 한은
00:09:53	 
		I know. But, Bonnie, I have to do something.
		 
		알아. 하지만 보니
		난 뭔가 해야해
00:09:54	 
		I have no idea who has Elena.
		 
		엘레나를 데려간게
		누군지 몰라
00:09:56	 
		I have no idea where she is.
		 
		어디 있는지 모른다고
00:09:58	 
		 
00:10:00	What if there was another way to find her?
		찾을 방법이 또 있다면?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:06	How does this work?
		어떻게 하는 거지?
00:10:08	 
		I'll use your blood to draw the energy for the tracking spell.
		 
		네 피를 이용해서
		추적 주문의 힘을 모을거야
00:10:11	 
		You're blood-related. It'll make the connection stronger.
		 
		넌 혈연관계라
		더 연결이 강하지
00:10:13	 
		All right, Alaric said we gotta clear out of here
		 
		좋아, 알라릭이 그러길
00:10:15	 
		within 10 minutes.
		 
		10분 안에 정리해야 한대
00:10:16	 
		I got weapons. He stocked me up.
		 
		무기는 챙겼어
00:10:18	 
		Are you ready?
		 
		준비 됐니?
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:56	There.
		거기
00:10:59	 
		- She's there. - That's 300 miles away.
		 
		저기 있네
		300마일이나 떨어진 곳에
00:11:01	 
		No, Bonnie, we need a more exact location than that.
		 
		아니, 보니, 그것보다
		더 정확한 위치가 필요해
00:11:04	 
		That's as close as I can get.
		 
		그게 최대야
00:11:05	 
		We can map it an aerial view.
		 
		위성 지도를 만드는거야
00:11:07	 
		It'll show us what's around there,
		 
		그 주변에 뭐가 있는지
		나타날거야
00:11:08	 
		- Help us narrow down the area. - Perfect.
		 
		위치를 좁히는데
		도움이 될거에요 / 좋아
00:11:10	 
		- Call me with whatever you find. - No, no.
		 
		- 찾으면 말해줘
		- 아뇨
00:11:11	 
		I'm coming with you.
		 
		같이 갈래요
00:11:12	 
		No, Jeremy, you're not.
		 
		제레미, 안된다
00:11:13	 
		I'm not gonna just sit here. What if she's hurt, ok?
		 
		그냥 앉아있지 않을거에요
		누나가 다치면 어쩌려고요?
00:11:15	 
		Or worse? What if she's...
		 
		더 심한 일이 생기면?
00:11:16	 
		She's not. You two go back to your house just in case.
		 
		안 그럴거야. 둘은
		모르니까 집에 가있어
00:11:18	 
		I'm gonna call you the minute I find her.
		 
		내가 찾으면
		바로 전화할게
00:11:20	 
		But you can't do this alone.
		 
		혼자서 하면 안되요
00:11:22	 
		He's not. Let's go.
		 
		혼자 안 가
		어서 가자
00:11:24	 
		You're coming with me?
		 
		나랑 같이 가게?
00:11:26	 
		It's Elena.
		 
		엘레나 일인걸
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:47	Du, What the hell was that? Where did that come from?
		대체 그거 뭐였냐?
		어떻게 한거야?
00:11:51	 
		How did you do that?
		 
		어떻게?
00:11:52	 
		Hi, Tyler. Where you goin'?
		 
		타일러
		어디 가?
00:11:54	 
		Come on, man. Do what we got, play the game.
		 
		어서 경기 계속 하자고
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:59	Hey. Um, are...You ok?
		타일러
		너.. 괜찮니?
00:12:04	 
		You lied to me earlier. Why?
		 
		아까 거짓말했지. 왜?
00:12:07	 
		Look. Tyler...
		 
		타일러..
00:12:09	 
		I think that you misunderstood me at the party.
		 
		파티때 날
		오해했던 거 같아
00:12:11	 
		I get it. It was very traumatic.
		 
		이해해
		충격이 컸지
00:12:13	 
		- You're lying. - Nope. But I'm late.
		 
		- 거짓말 하는군
		- 아니. 하지만 늦었어
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:27	How did you...
		너 어떻게...
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:29	- You're stronger than me? - Please. That was nothing.
		- 나보다 강한거야?
		- 그러지마. 아무것도 아녔어
00:12:33	 
		Listen, if you know something, you gotta tell me,
		 
		너 아는 거 있으면
		나한테 말해줘
00:12:35	 
		Because I can't handle this.
		 
		감당할 수 없거든
00:12:37	 
		I'm sorry, Tyler,
		 
		미안해, 타일러
00:12:39	 
		But I think that you're still in shock over Sarah dying.
		 
		새라 죽은것 때문에
		쇼크 먹은 거 같아
00:12:42	 
		And it's understandable.
		 
		이해된다구
00:12:44	 
		 
00:13:09	Alaric likes his weapons.
		알라릭은 무기를 좋아하는군
00:13:11	 
		What the hell is that?
		 
		대체 그게 뭐야?
00:13:12	 
		Well, it's a vervain bomb or grenade launch
		 
		마편초 수류탄
00:13:14	 
		- Or something like that. - Weird.
		 
		- 뭐 그런거야
		- 별나군
00:13:16	 
		- Hey, how much further is it? - About 80 miles.
		 
		- 얼마나 남았지?
		- 80마일 정도
00:13:19	 
		Who do you think took her?
		 
		누가 납치한거 같아?
00:13:21	 
		Someone from Katherine's past.
		 
		캐더린 과거의 누군가
00:13:22	 
		She said she was running from someone.
		 
		누군가로부터
		도망치고 있댔어
00:13:25	 
		Maybe they got the wrong girl.
		 
		사람을 잘못 잡았나봐
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:29	Thank you for helping me.
		도와줘서 고마워
00:13:32	 
		Can we not do the whole road-trip bonding thing?
		 
		로드트립을 하면서
		우애다지기 하지 말아줄래?
00:13:35	 
		The clich of it all makes me itch.
		 
		그 진부함에
		닭살이 돋는다
00:13:36	 
		Oh, come on, Damon.
		 
		왜 이래
00:13:38	 
		We both know that you being in this car
		 
		형이 이 차에 탄 건
00:13:39	 
		has absolutely nothing to do with me, anyway.
		 
		나랑 상관 없는게 뻔한데
00:13:42	 
		The elephant in the room lets out a mighty roar.
		 
		다 아는 얘기를
		드러내는군
00:13:45	 
		Well, it doesn't have to be an elephant.
		 
		숨길 필요 없잖아
00:13:46	 
		Let's talk about it.
		 
		얘기해보자
00:13:48	 
		There's nothing to talk about.
		 
		얘기할 거 없어
00:13:49	 
		That's not true. Sure there is.
		 
		- 거짓말
		- 맞는걸
00:13:51	 
		Let's get it out. I mean, are you in this car
		 
		어서 털어놔
		이 차에 탄게
00:13:52	 
		because you want to help your little brother save a girl that he loves,
		 
		동생이 사랑하는 여자를
		구해주고 싶어서야?
00:13:55	 
		Or is it.. is it because you love her, too? Hmm?
		 
		아니면 형도
		그녀를 사랑해서야?
00:13:59	 
		 
00:14:00	I mean, come on. Express yourself.
		어서, 표현해보라고
00:14:02	 
		I happen to like road-trip bonding.
		 
		로드트립을 통한
		우애 다지기를 좋아해서 말야
00:14:04	 
		Keep it up, Stefan. I can step out of helping as easily as I stepped in.
		 
		계속 그래보셔. 쉽게 발들인만큼
		발빼기도 쉬우니까
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:10	Nope. See, that's the beauty of it.
		아니, 그게 좋은 점이야
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:14	You can't.
		빠져나갈 수 없단거
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:27	Alaric just left with jenna.
		알라릭은 방금
		제나 이모랑 나갔어
00:14:28	 
		He's getting her out of the house for a while
		 
		잠시 외출을 하면
00:14:29	 
		so she doesn't ask questions about Elena. Look, I pulled this up
		 
		엘레나에 대해 묻지 않을거야
00:14:32	 
		based on that spot on the map.
		 
		지도의 장소에 근거해서
		이 위치를 찾아냈어
00:14:33	 
		There's nothing for miles except for this old house.
		 
		집이 한 채 외에는
		아무것도 없어
00:14:35	 
		- Did you send it to Stefan? - Yeah.
		 
		- 스테판한테 보냈니?
		- 응
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:41	I hate sitting here, waiting like this.
		여기 앉아서
		이렇게 기다리기 싫다
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:48	She's gonna be fine.
		괜찮아질거야
00:14:50	 
		You don't know that.
		 
		모르는 소리잖아
00:14:54	 
		No, I don't.
		 
		그래
00:14:57	 
		 
00:15:05	What are you doing?
		뭐 하는거야?
00:15:06	 
		I have something else I want to try.
		 
		시도하고 싶은게
		하나 더 있어
00:15:08	 
		 
00:15:10	I don't get it.
		이해가 안 가
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	I need a candle. Grab Elena's hairbrush.
		양초가 필요해
		엘레나 머리빗도
00:15:15	 
		Ok, yeah.
		 
		알았어
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:31	What's all this stuff for?
		이게 다 왜 필요한대?
00:15:32	 
		I know it's crazy,
		 
		미친 것 같아 보이는 거 아는데
00:15:33	 
		But I might be able to get her a message.
		 
		메세지를 전달할 수 있을거야
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:55	Bonnie?
		보니?
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:57	Bonnie.
		보니
00:15:58	 
		Bonnie. Bonnie!
		 
		보니
00:16:01	 
		Bonnie.
		 
		보니
00:16:03	 
		 
00:16:07	Bonnie.
		보니
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:14	Bonnie!
		보니
00:16:15	 
		Bonnie! Bonnie!
		 
		보니!
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:18	Why am I here?
		내가 왜 여기 있는거죠?
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	You keep asking me these questions
		계속 질문을 한다고
00:16:22	 
		like I'm gonna answer them.
		 
		내가 답할 것 같니
00:16:23	 
		Why won't you?
		 
		왜 대답을 안해주시는 거죠?
00:16:24	 
		That's another one.
		 
		또다른 질문이군
00:16:26	 
		You got me.
		 
		제가 졌어요
00:16:27	 
		Ok? It's not like I can go anywhere.
		 
		어딜 나갈 수 있는 것도 아니잖아요
00:16:29	 
		The least you can do is tell me what you want with me.
		 
		최소한 무슨 이유 때문에
		절 원하는지 알려줄 수 있잖아요
00:16:32	 
		I personally want nothing.
		 
		난 개인적으로
		원하는 게 없어
00:16:33	 
		I'm just a delivery service.
		 
		그저 배달서비스를
		해주는 것 뿐이지
00:16:35	 
		Delivery to who? Elijah?
		 
		누구한테 배달을요?
		엘라이자요?
00:16:38	 
		Ah heh. 2 points to the eavesdropper.
		 
		엿듣기 좋아하는 엘레나. 2점 획득
00:16:41	 
		Who is he?
		 
		엘라이자가 누구죠?
00:16:43	 
		Is he a vampire?
		 
		뱀파이어인가요?
00:16:44	 
		He's one of the vampires, the originals.
		 
		1세대 뱀파이어지
00:16:47	 
		What do you mean, the originals?
		 
		1세대라뇨?
00:16:49	 
		Again with the questions. Haven't the Salvatores
		 
		또 질문이군
		살바토어가 남자들이
00:16:50	 
		Been teaching you your vampire history?
		 
		네 뱀파이어 역사를
		안 가르쳐 준거니?
00:16:53	 
		So, you know Stefan and Damon.
		 
		스테판과
		데이먼을 알아요?
00:16:55	 
		I know of them. A hundred years back,
		 
		알지. 백년 전에
00:16:58	 
		A friend of mine tried to set me up with Stefan.
		 
		내 친구가 스테판을
		소개해주려고 했었거든
00:17:01	 
		She said he was one of the good ones.
		 
		선한 부류라면서
00:17:03	 
		I'm more of a sucker for the bad boys, though,
		 
		난 나쁜 남자라면
		죽을 못쓰는 타입이라
00:17:06	 
		but I digress.
		 
		말이 딴길로 샜군
00:17:07	 
		Who are the originals?
		 
		1세대 뱀파이어들은 누구죠?
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:14	Trevor and I have been running for 500 years.
		트레버와 나는
		500년간 도망쳐 다녔어
00:17:16	 
		We're tired. We want it over.
		 
		지쳤어
		끝내고 싶지
00:17:19	 
		We're using you to negotiate ourselves
		 
		널 이용해서
00:17:21	 
		out of an old mess.
		 
		우리의 혼란을
		정리하려는 거야
00:17:23	 
		But why me?
		 
		하지만 왜 저를?
00:17:25	 
		Because you're a Petrova doppelganger.
		 
		넌 페트로바의
		도플갱어니까
00:17:28	 
		You're the key to breaking the curse.
		 
		넌 저주를 깨는
		열쇠거든
00:17:30	 
		Curse?
		 
		저주요?
00:17:33	 
		The sun and the moon curse?
		 
		태양과 달의 저주요?
00:17:36	 
		Ohh. You do know your history.
		 
		역사를 알긴 아는군
00:17:37	 
		What do you mean I'm the key?
		 
		내가 열쇠라뇨?
00:17:39	 
		The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
		 
		월장석이 저주를 깨는 열쇠잖아요
00:17:42	 
		No. The moonstone is what binds the curse.
		 
		아니. 월장석은
		저주를 묶는 도구고
00:17:45	 
		Sacrifice is what breaks it.
		 
		제물이 있어야
		풀 수 있지
00:17:47	 
		Sacrifice?
		 
		제물요?
00:17:49	 
		The blood of the doppelganger.
		 
		도플갱어의 피
00:17:51	 
		You're the doppelganger.
		 
		네가 바로 그 도플갱어야
00:17:53	 
		Aka, in order to break the curse,
		 
		그러니까, 저주를 풀려면
00:17:55	 
		You're the one that has to die.
		 
		바로 네가 죽어야 하는 거지
00:17:58	 
		 
00:18:14	Mom?
		엄마?
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:36	- What are you doing here? - I know.
		- 여긴 왠 일이야?
		- 알아
00:18:38	 
		Breaking and entering the sheriff's house?
		 
		보안관 집에
		무단침입하는 거
00:18:40	 
		That move will win you an award.
		 
		상도 받으시겠는 걸
00:18:42	 
		Go ahead. Keep dodging.
		 
		계속해봐
		회피해보라고
00:18:45	 
		Keep changing the subject.
		 
		계속 주제를 바꾸고
00:18:47	 
		But I know.
		 
		하지만 난 알아
00:18:49	 
		You're just like me. Aren't you?
		 
		너도 나와 같은 존재지?
00:18:52	 
		No.
		 
		아니
00:18:54	 
		Keep it up, but I'm not buying it.
		 
		열심히 연기해 봐
		안 믿으니까
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:58	I saw how strong you were.
		네가 얼마나 강한지 봤어
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:01	I'm not leaving here until you tell me the truth.
		사실을 말하기 전까지
		떠나지 않을거야
00:19:05	 
		Tyler...
		 
		타일러
00:19:06	 
		You're a werewolf. Say it.
		 
		너 늑대인간이지
		말해
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:18	What?
		뭐라고?
00:19:19	 
		- Stop lying. - I'm not lying.
		 
		- 거짓말 그만해
		- 거짓말 아냐
00:19:22	 
		Say it!
		 
		말하라고!
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:34	I'm not a werewolf. Ok?
		난 늑대인간이 아냐
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:41	Tell me more.
		더 말해줘요
00:19:43	 
		Captivity has made her pushy, eh?
		 
		가둬두니까
		더 뻔뻔해졌군?
00:19:46	 
		What do you want to know, doppelicious?
		 
		뭘 알고 싶지?
		도플갱어?
00:19:49	 
		Who are you running from?
		 
		누구한테서
		도망치는 거죠?
00:19:52	 
		The originals.
		 
		1세대
00:19:53	 
		Yeah, she said that. What does that mean?
		 
		그건 들었어요
		그게 무슨 뜻이죠?
00:19:55	 
		The first family--
		 
		1세대 가문..
00:19:57	 
		The old world-- Rose and I pissed 'em off. Mm-mmm.
		 
		구세계를
		나와 로즈가 열받게 했지
00:20:00	 
		Correction-- I pissed them off.
		 
		정정하지
		내가 열을 받게 만들고
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:02	Rose had my back. And for over half a millennium,
		로즈가 날 도왔지
		500년 동안
00:20:05	 
		They've wanted us dead.
		 
		우릴 죽이려 찾아다녔지
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:08	What did you do?
		뭘 하신거죠?
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:10	He made the same mistake countless others did.
		다른 많은 사람들과
		같은 실수를 저질렀지
00:20:12	 
		He trusted Katerina Petrova.
		 
		캐터리나 페트로바를 믿었어
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	Katherine.
		캐더린
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	The one and only-- the first Petrova doppelganger.
		유일무이한
		1세대 페트로바의 도플갱어
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:21	I helped her escape her fate.
		그녀의 숙명에서
		도망치게 도와줬어
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	And now I've-- sorry, we've--
		이제 난..
		미안. 우리는
00:20:25	 
		been marked ever since.
		 
		그 후로 요주인물이 되었지
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	Which is why we're not gonna make the same mistake again.
		그래서 똑같은 실수는
		저지르지 않을거야
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:38	Here. Drink this.
		여기. 마셔
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:39	Thanks.
		고마워
00:20:41	 
		 
00:20:43	What happened? You scared the hell out of me.
		어떻게 된거야?
		깜짝 놀랐잖아
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:46	It's nothing.
		아무 것도 아냐
00:20:47	 
		It wasn't nothing, Bonnie.
		 
		아무것도 아니긴, 보니 누나
00:20:48	 
		 
00:20:49	I've been doing a lot of magic lately.
		요즘 마법을 많이 써서
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:52	It wears me down.
		녹초가 되거든
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:54	When I'm worn down, I take a nap.
		난 녹초가 되면 낮잠을 자
00:20:55	 
		You were-- you were unconscious.
		 
		누나는.. 정신을 잃었다구
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	Witchcraft has its limits.
		마법은 한계가 있는걸
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:02	If I push too hard, it pushes back.
		심하게 몰아붙이면
		반발력이 생기지
00:21:04	 
		 
00:21:05	How do you know all this?
		그걸 다 어떻게 알아?
00:21:07	 
		It's all in here.
		 
		다 주술서에 적혀 있는걸
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	It's like a reminder that I'm not invincible.
		내가 무적이 아니란걸
		상기시켜주는 거야
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:14	Please...
		제발..
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:16	Don't--don't tell anyone.
		아무한테.. 말하지 마
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:19	Why not? Because it's a weakness,
		왜? / 내 약점이니까
00:21:21	 
		And I don't want certain people to know that.
		 
		특정한 사람들이
		알지 않았음 좋겠어
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:24	By certain people, you mean Damon.
		특정한 사람이라면
		데이먼 말이구나
00:21:26	 
		 
00:21:27	I mean anyone that could hurt me.
		날 해칠 수 있는
		사람들 말야
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:31	I won't tell anyone, ok? I promise.
		아무한테 말 안할게
		약속해
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:40	It's hard, you know?
		힘들어
00:21:41	 
		My grams is gone, and my dad,
		 
		할머니가 떠나시고
		아빠는
00:21:43	 
		He doesn't want to know about what I am.
		 
		내 정체를 알고 싶어하지 않으셔
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	He hasn't since my mom left.
		엄마가 세상을 떠난 후론 말야
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:50	I'm all alone in this.
		나 혼자밖에 없어
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:53	That's how I feel a lot of the time,
		나도 대부분 그렇게 느껴
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:56	Alone.
		혼자라고
00:21:57	 
		 
00:22:02	Uh, you--you think that worked?
		주문 효과가 있었을까?
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:05	I have no idea.
		모르겠어
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:35	We're gettin' close.
		가까워졌어
00:22:36	 
		Jeremy said there's an access road
		 
		제레미가 그러길
		6번 표지판을 지나면
00:22:37	 
		just past mile marker 6.
		 
		진입로가 있댔어
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:48	If you want some, just ask.
		원하면 말해
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:50	I want some.
		원해
00:22:51	 
		Aw, that's so sweet.
		 
		참 다정도 하셔라
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:53	Gonna be all big and strong
		여자친구를 구하기 위해
00:22:54	 
		to save your girl. Well, don't worry.
		 
		강해지시겠다
		걱정 마셔
00:22:56	 
		I've got your back. You'll be fine.
		 
		내가 도울테니
		괜찮을거야
00:22:57	 
		 
00:22:58	I'm not joking.
		농담 아냐
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	I been drinking a little every day,
		매일 인간피를 조금씩 마시고 있어
00:23:01	 
		 
00:23:01	Slowly increasing my intake
		양을 조금씩 늘리면서
00:23:04	 
		and building up my strength.
		 
		힘을 늘리고 있지
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:12	Does Elena know you're drinking blood?
		엘레나도 인간피 마시는 거 아니?
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:19	I've been drinking hers.
		엘레나 피를
		마시고 있었거든
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:26	How romantic.
		정말 로맨틱하셔라
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:30	Since we're road-trip bonding,
		로드 트립을 통해
		우애 다지는 중이니
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:32	Remember the days when all you lived for was blood,
		네가 사는 유일한 이유가
		피였을 때를 기억해봐
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	You were the guy who would
		재미를 위해
		사람을 물어뜯던
00:23:36	 
		rip someone apart just for the fun of it?
		 
		그 시절을 말야?
00:23:38	 
		 
00:23:39	You mean when I was more like you?
		형과 같았던 시절 말이지?
00:23:40	 
		Yes, Stefan. Exactly.
		 
		그래. 내 말이
00:23:42	 
		 
00:23:42	Back when you put blood into me
		그 때 넌
		나한테 피를 줬지
00:23:44	 
		so I could be a big, bad vampire.
		 
		그래서 내가 크고
		못된 뱀파이어가 되게끔
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:46	Wonder if Elena would be so quick
		엘레나가 그런 너한테
00:23:48	 
		to open her veins to that guy?
		 
		그리 빨리
		정맥을 내주다니?
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:50	By the way, what happened to that guy?
		그건 그렇고
		그 시절 그 녀석은 어떻게 됐어?
00:23:52	 
		He was a hoot.
		 
		얼간이였는데
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:54	Guess he found something else to live for.
		뭔가 살아갈 이유를
		찾은 거 같은데
00:23:56	 
		 
00:24:07	He's here.
		그가 왔어
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:09	This was a mistake.
		실수였어
00:24:10	 
		No, I told you I would get us out of this.
		 
		아니, 내가
		빠져나가게 해줄거랬지
00:24:11	 
		You have to trust me.
		 
		날 믿어줘
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:12	No! He wants me dead, Rose!
		아니, 날 죽이고 싶어한다구! 로즈!
00:24:14	 
		He wants her more.
		 
		너보단 엘레나를 더 원해
00:24:16	 
		 
00:24:16	I can't do this. You give her to him,
		난 못 해
		네가 인도해
00:24:18	 
		He'll have mercy on you,
		 
		너한텐 자비를 베풀거야
00:24:19	 
		But I need to get out of here.
		 
		난 여길 나가야 겠어
00:24:20	 
		Hey. What are we?
		 
		우린 어떤 사이지?
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:26	We're family.
		가족이지
00:24:27	 
		 
00:24:29	Forever.
		영원히
00:24:30	 
		 
00:24:35	You're scared.
		두려우신거군요
00:24:36	 
		 
00:24:37	Stay here with her
		같이 있어
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:39	And don't make a sound.
		소리내지 마
00:24:40	 
		 
00:25:08	Rose Marie.
		로즈 메리
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:10	Is there somewhere we can talk?
		얘기 좀 할 수 있겠나?
00:25:12	 
		 
00:25:14	Yes.
		네
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:15	In here.
		여기서요
00:25:16	 
		 
00:25:16	You h-have to forgive the house.
		집안 상태는 양해해 주세요
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	Oh, no. What's a little dirt?
		아니, 좀 더럽지만
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:21	I completely understand.
		완벽히 이해하네
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:24	So tell me,
		말해주게
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:25	What is it that gives you the courage to call me?
		나한테 연락을 할
		용기가 어디서 난게지?
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	I wanted my freedom.
		자유를 원해요
00:25:29	 
		 
00:25:30	I'm tired of running.
		도망치는데 지쳤어요
00:25:31	 
		 
00:25:31	You're in a position to grant me that.
		자유를 주실
		지위를 가지셨으니까요
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:33	I have complete authority to grant pardon
		너와 네 애완견에게
00:25:35	 
		to you and your little pet.
		 
		사면을 할 권한이 있지
00:25:37	 
		What is his name these days? Trevor.
		 
		요즘 그의 이름이 뭐더라?
		트레버지
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:40	If I so see fit.
		참 잘 어울려
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:42	Katerina Petrova?
		캐터리나 페트로바 말이죠
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:47	I'm listening.
		듣고 있네
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:48	She didn't burn in the church in 1864.
		1864년에 교회 안에서
		불에 타 죽은게 아녔어요
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:54	Continue.
		계속하게
00:25:55	 
		 
00:25:55	She survived.
		살아남았습니다
00:25:57	 
		 
00:25:58	Where is she?
		어디있나?
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:00	You don't seem surprised by this.
		놀라지 않은 눈치군요
00:26:01	 
		 
00:26:01	Oh, when you called and
		전화를 해서
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:02	invited me into this armpit of civilization,
		미스틱 폴즈에서
		대략 3시간 떨어진
00:26:05	 
		 
00:26:05	Which is a mere 3 hours from the town we know as Mystic Falls,
		이 누추한 곳으로
		초대했을 때
00:26:08	 
		I surmised it had everything to do with Katerina.
		 
		캐더리나와 연관된 것임을
		짐작했네
00:26:11	 
		 
00:26:11	Do you have her in your possession?
		그녀를 데리고 있나?
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:14	No.
		아뇨
00:26:15	 
		I have better.
		 
		더 좋은 걸 가지고 있습니다
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:17	I have her doppelganger.
		도플갱어를 잡고 있어요
00:26:18	 
		 
00:26:19	That's impossible.
		그건 불가능해
00:26:20	 
		 
00:26:21	Her family line ended with her.
		캐더린으로 족보가 끝났는걸
00:26:22	 
		I know that for a fact.
		 
		그건 정확히 알지
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:23	The facts are wrong.
		잘못된 정보에요
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:27	Well, show her to me.
		그럼 나에게 보여주게
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	Elijah, you're a man of honor.
		엘라이자
		당신은 신사이죠
00:26:30	 
		You're to be trusted,
		 
		신뢰할 수 있구요
00:26:31	 
		 
00:26:33	But I want to hear you say it again.
		하지만 다시 말해주십시요
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:36	You have my word that I will pardon you.
		자네를 사면하겠다
		약속하겠네
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:41	Follow me.
		따라오세요
00:26:42	 
		 
00:27:21	Human.
		인간이군
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:23	It's impossible.
		불가능해
00:27:24	 
		 
00:27:27	Hello there.
		안녕
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:35	House should be just beyond those trees.
		이 나무들 뒤에
		집이 보일거야
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:38	Wait. Now, I've got a little more experience
		잠깐. 이런 일에는
00:27:39	 
		than you do with this sort of thing.
		 
		나한테 경험이 더 많아
00:27:41	 
		 
00:27:41	So what's your point?
		요점이 뭐야?
00:27:42	 
		My point is whoever has Elena
		 
		내 요점은
		엘레나를 납치한게 누구든
00:27:43	 
		is probably who was after Katherine in 1864 and before that.
		 
		아마 1864년 이전부터
		캐더린을 쫓았을 거란 거지
00:27:47	 
		And?
		 
		그래서?
00:27:48	 
		And it puts them at 500 years old and strong.
		 
		그러니 500세는 넘고
		강할 거란 거야
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	Are you sure you wanna do this?
		정말 가고 싶니?
00:27:51	 
		Yeah, I'm certain I wanna do it.
		 
		응, 정말 가고 싶어
00:27:53	 
		'cause we go in that house,
		 
		그 집에 들어가면
00:27:54	 
		We might not come back out.
		 
		못 나올지도 몰라
00:27:55	 
		 
00:27:55	All right. Then I won't come out.
		좋아. 그럼 나오지 말지
00:27:57	 
		 
00:27:57	So noble, Stefan.
		정말 고결하시군
00:27:58	 
		 
00:28:00	I can't think of a better reason to die.
		죽을 더 좋은 이유가
		생각이 안나는데
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:04	But go on and stay here.
		원하면 여기 있어
00:28:05	 
		I'll totally understand.
		 
		완벽히 이해할테니
00:28:07	 
		 
00:28:14	Well, we have a long journey ahead of us.
		정말 긴 여정이 남았으니
00:28:15	 
		We should be going.
		 
		가봐야겠군
00:28:17	 
		Please, don't let him take me.
		 
		제발 날 데려가지 않게 해줘요
00:28:19	 
		One last piece of business.
		 
		가기 전에 마지막으로
00:28:20	 
		 
00:28:21	Then we're done.
		끝낼 게 있네
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:25	I've waited so long for this day, Elijah.
		오랫동안 이 날만을
		기다렸습니다, 엘라이자
00:28:28	 
		 
00:28:29	I'm truly very sorry.
		깊이 사과의 말을 전합니다
00:28:31	 
		Oh, no, your apology's not necessary.
		 
		사과할 필요 없네
00:28:32	 
		Yes. Yes, it is.
		 
		아뇨
00:28:35	 
		 
00:28:36	You trusted me with Katerina...
		캐더리나를 믿고 맡기셨지만
00:28:38	 
		 
00:28:39	And I failed you.
		제가 실망시켜 드렸으니
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:42	Oh, yes, you are the guilty one,
		그래, 자네가
		바로 그런 죄인이지
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:45	And Rose aided you
		하지만 로즈가 협조했어
00:28:46	 
		because she was loyal to you.
		 
		너한테 충성스러웠으니
00:28:47	 
		That, I honor.
		 
		그건 존중하네
00:28:49	 
		 
00:28:52	Where was your loyalty?
		자네의 충성은
		어디다 둔게지?
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:55	I beg your forgiveness.
		용서해 주십시요
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:59	So granted.
		용서해주지
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:06	You--
		당신..
00:29:07	 
		Don't, Rose...
		 
		그러지 말게, 로즈
00:29:09	 
		 
00:29:10	Now that you are free.
		이제 자유의 몸이 됐으니
00:29:12	 
		 
00:29:16	Come.
		이리 오게
00:29:16	 
		No, what about the moonstone?
		 
		월장석은 어쩌구요?
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:19	What do you know about the moonstone?
		아는게 있나?
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:21	I know that you need it,
		필요하신거 알고
00:29:23	 
		and I know where it is.
		 
		어디 있는지도 알아요
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:24	Yes.
		그래
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:26	I can help you get it.
		찾는데 도와드릴게요
00:29:27	 
		Tell me where it is.
		 
		어디 있는지 말해
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	It doesn't work that way.
		그렇게는 못해요
00:29:30	 
		 
00:29:32	Are you negotiating with me?
		나와 협상하는 겐가?
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:35	It's the first I've heard of it.
		전 처음 듣는 얘기에요
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:46	What is this vervain doing around your neck?
		네 목에 있는
		마편초는 뭐지?
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:53	Tell me where the moonstone is.
		월장석이 어디 있는지 말해
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:56	In the tomb underneath the church ruins.
		교회 잔해의
		무덤 아래에
00:29:58	 
		What is it doing there?
		 
		거긴 왜?
00:29:59	 
		 
00:30:00	It's with Katherine.
		캐더린이 숨겼어요
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:02	Interesting.
		흥미롭군
00:30:03	 
		 
00:30:05	What is that?
		방금 뭐였지?
00:30:06	 
		I don't know.
		 
		모르겠어요
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	Who else is in this house?
		이 집에 누가 또 있나?
00:30:09	 
		I don't know.
		 
		모릅니다
00:30:10	 
		 
00:30:16	Move!
		움직여!
00:30:17	 
		 
00:30:30	Rose.
		로즈
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:31	I don't know who it is.
		누군지 모릅니다
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:36	Up here.
		위에 있어
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:41	Down here.
		바로 이 아래에
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:59	Excuse me.
		실례해요
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:02	To whom it may concern,
		누구시든지
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	you're making a great mistake
		날 이길 거라 생각한다면
00:31:06	 
		if you think that you can beat me.
		 
		큰 오산이네
00:31:07	 
		 
00:31:08	You can't.
		이길 수 없어
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	You hear that?
		들었나?
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:11	I repeat--
		반복하지
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	You cannot beat me.
		날 이길 수 없어
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	So I want the girl
		난 그 여자를 원해
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:20	on the count of 3,
		셋을 세겠네
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:22	or heads will roll.
		아니면 머리가 날라갈거야
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:29	Do we understand each other?
		무슨 말인지 알겠나?
00:31:31	 
		 
00:31:32	I'll come with you.
		따라갈게요
00:31:33	 
		Just please don't hurt my friends.
		 
		제 친구들을
		해치지 말아주세요
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:36	They just wanted to help me out.
		절 도우려던 것 뿐이에요
00:31:37	 
		 
00:31:43	What game are you playing with me?
		나랑 무슨 게임을 하는 거지?
00:31:45	 
		 
00:32:34	Just let her go.
		그냥 놔줘요
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:42	Hey, come here. Are you hurt? You ok?
		이리 와
		다쳤어? 괜찮아?
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:54	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:32:55	 
		 
00:32:55	You're welcome.
		천만에
00:32:56	 
		 
00:33:19	Elena?!
		엘레나?
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:34	Are you ok?
		괜찮아?
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:36	I'm ok.
		응
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:40	I'm ok.
		멀쩡해
00:33:41	 
		 
00:33:43	I got your message.
		메세지 받았다
00:33:45	 
		 
00:34:16	Where's Elena?
		엘레나는 어디 있어?
00:34:17	 
		 
00:34:18	She's home.
		집에
00:34:19	 
		 
00:34:19	And you're here why?
		넌 왜 여기 있고?
00:34:20	 
		 
00:34:21	Because she wanted to be with Jeremy.
		엘레나가 동생하고
		있고 싶대서
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:23	Here.
		여기
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:25	Thanks.
		고마워
00:34:26	 
		 
00:34:27	Listen, uh,
		들어봐
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	what Rose told Elena about the curse...
		로즈가 엘레나한테
		말한 저주 얘기..
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:31	I know. We'll keep her safe.
		알아. 안전하게
		지켜줘야 해
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:35	You know the only way we're gonna be able to do that is
		그렇게 하기 위해선
00:34:37	 
		if we're not fighting each other.
		 
		서로 싸우면 안 돼
00:34:39	 
		 
00:34:41	We let Katherine come between us.
		캐더린 때문에
		갈라졌었잖아
00:34:42	 
		We let that happen with Elena,
		 
		엘레나한테도 그렇게 되면 안돼
00:34:43	 
		we're not gonna be able to protect her.
		 
		지켜줄 수 없게 될거야
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	Yes, Stefan.
		그래, 스테판
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:47	Heard it all before.
		전에도 들은 소리야
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:52	What?
		뭐?
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:55	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:34:56	 
		 
00:34:57	About what?
		뭐가?
00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:59	For being the guy who made you turn 145 years ago.
		145년 전에 뱀파이어가 되게 만든거
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:04	Enough, Stef. It's late.
		됐어. 이미 늦었다구
00:35:06	 
		We don't need to rehash that.
		 
		되풀이 할 필요 없잖아
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:08	You know what? I've never said it out loud.
		이거 알아?
		직접 말 못했는데
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:12	I guess I just need to say it,
		이제 말 해야겠어
00:35:13	 
		and you need to hear it.
		 
		들어줬으면 좋겠어
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:17	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:20	What I did was selfish.
		내 행동은
		이기적이었어
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:22	I didn't want to be alone.
		난 혼자가 되고 싶지 않았거든
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:27	Guess I just needed my brother.
		우리 형이 필요했나봐
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:38	You know what? This sounds crazy,
		있지, 정신 나간 소리 같지만
00:35:39	 
		but alcohol helps.
		 
		알코올이 도움이 돼
00:35:41	 
		Or at least it helps me.
		 
		최소한 나한테는
00:35:43	 
		 
00:35:43	You know, with all that inside jittery stuff.
		신경과민을 덜어줘
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:46	I'm hot.
		덥다
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:48	It's like my skin is on fire.
		피부가 타는 거 같아
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:51	Really?
		정말?
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:53	I never had any of that.
		난 그런 적 없는데
00:35:54	 
		 
00:35:55	Guess wolves are different.
		늑대인간은 다른가봐
00:35:57	 
		 
00:35:59	At the beginning, I was very, very emotional.
		처음에 난 정말
		감정적이었어
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:04	Everything was heightened.
		모든 감정이 더 증대됐지
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:05	I have that.
		나도 그래
00:36:07	 
		 
00:36:10	How can you be a vampire?
		어떻게 뱀파이어가 된거야?
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:14	How can you be a werewolf?
		어떻게 늑대인간이 된거야?
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:20	Who else is like you?
		다른 뱀파이어도 있니?
00:36:21	 
		 
00:36:24	Just me.
		나밖에 없어
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:27	It's a really long story.
		얘기가 길어
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:29	We can share another time.
		나중에 얘기하자
00:36:30	 
		Uh, how many other werewolves are there?
		 
		늑대인간은 얼마나 돼?
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:34	Just me.
		나밖에
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:36	And my uncle Mason,
		삼촌 메이슨도
00:36:37	 
		but he left town.
		 
		하지만 동네를 떠났어
00:36:39	 
		 
00:36:40	Look, Tyler...
		타일러
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:44	You can't tell anyone, OK?
		아무한테 말하지 마
00:36:47	 
		 
00:36:47	Not about you, not about me.
		너나 나에 관해서
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:49	No one will understand.
		아무도 이해 못 할거야
00:36:51	 
		 
00:36:52	I know.
		알아
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:54	I want to tell you about my mom and yours
		네 엄마나 우리 엄마나
00:36:59	 
		 
00:36:59	and the founding families and the council,
		설립자 가족과
		의회에 대해 말하고 싶어
00:37:02	 
		but I need you to promise me
		 
		하지만 약속해줘야 해
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:06	no one will find out about us.
		아무도 우리 정체를
		알아선 안된다고
00:37:08	 
		 
00:37:10	This is life and death, Tyler.
		이건 생사 문제야, 타일러
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:15	I have no one else to tell.
		난 달리 말할 사람이 아무도 없어
00:37:17	 
		 
00:37:21	I'm sorry about earlier.
		요전에는 미안했어
00:37:23	 
		It's just-- I'm alone with this.
		 
		그게.. 나 혼자라서
00:37:27	 
		 
00:37:28	It's gonna happen to me.
		일이 생길거야
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:30	On the next full moon, I'm gonna turn,
		보름달이 뜨면
		난 변할거야
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:34	and I won't be able to stop it.
		멈출 수 없을거라구
00:37:36	 
		 
00:37:39	I'm scared.
		두려워
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:43	Tyler.
		타일러
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:45	No, it's all right.
		아니, 괜찮아
00:37:47	 
		 
00:38:09	Who's there?
		누구세요?
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:13	I'm not here to hurt you.
		해치려고 온 게 아냐
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:16	Why are you here?
		여긴 왜 온거죠?
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:17	Lexi once told me that you're one of the good ones.
		렉시가 그러길
		선한 편이라던데
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:21	You knew Lexi?
		렉시를 알아요?
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:23	Trevor was my best friend.
		트레버는 내 친한 친구였어
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:26	For 500 years, I have lived with one person,
		500년 동안
		한 사람과 살았는데
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:30	and he's gone.
		그 사람이
		세상을 떠났지
00:38:31	 
		 
00:38:34	And I don't wanna run anymore,
		더 이상 도망치고 싶지 않아
00:38:35	 
		because I don't have anybwhere else to run to.
		 
		달리 도망칠 곳이 없거든
00:38:37	 
		 
00:38:38	Well, I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
		당신을 도울 수 없어
		미안하군요
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:41	I don't need your help,
		도움 필요 없어
00:38:43	 
		 
00:38:44	but I think you need mine.
		하지만 자네는
		내 도움이 필요하지
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:48	Elijah may be dead, but this isn't over.
		엘라이자가 죽었을지 몰라도
		끝난게 아냐
00:38:50	 
		 
00:38:50	What do you mean it's not over?
		끝난게 아니라니요?
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:52	It isn't over.
		끝나지 않았어
00:38:53	 
		 
00:38:54	The originals, they'll come for her.
		1세대가
		그녀를 찾아올거야
00:38:57	 
		 
00:38:59	They have to.
		그래야만 하지
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:02	They're doing it for him.
		그를 위해 찾을거야
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:05	For who?
		누구를 위해서요?
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:07	Klaus.
		클라우스
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:23	Cute PJS.
		바지가 귀엽군
00:39:24	 
		 
00:39:27	I'm tired, Damon.
		나 피곤해요
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:33	Brought you this.
		이걸 가져왔다
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:35	I thought that was gone.
		잃어버린 줄 알았는데
00:39:36	 
		 
00:39:39	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:44	Please give it back.
		제발 돌려줘요
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:46	I just have to say something.
		이 말 해야겠다
00:39:48	 
		 
00:39:48	Why do you have to say it with my necklace?
		목걸이 가지고
		무슨 말을 하려구요?
00:39:50	 
		 
00:39:51	Well...
		그게..
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:53	Because what I'm about to say is...
		내가 하려는 말은
00:39:55	 
		 
00:39:57	probably the most selfish thing I've ever said in my life.
		아마 내 인생에서
		가장 이기적인 말일거다
00:40:00	 
		 
00:40:01	Damon, don't go there.
		데이먼, 그러지 마요
00:40:03	 
		No. I just have to say it once.
		 
		아니. 한번만 말할게
00:40:04	 
		You just need to hear it.
		 
		그냥 들어주렴
00:40:06	 
		 
00:40:09	I love you, Elena.
		사랑한다, 엘레나
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:13	And it's because I love you that...
		널 사랑하는 이유는
00:40:15	 
		 
00:40:18	I can't be selfish with you...
		너한테 이기적일 수 없어서야
00:40:20	 
		 
00:40:23	Why you can't know this.
		이 사실을 알아서는
		안되는 이유는
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:26	I don't deserve you...
		난 널 가질 자격이 없기 때문이지
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:31	But my brother does.
		내 동생한테 자격이 있지
00:40:32	 
		 
00:40:47	God, I wish you didn't have to forget this.
		정말 잊지 않았으면 좋겠는데
00:40:49	 
		 
00:40:53	But you do.
		잊어아만 한다
00:40:54
