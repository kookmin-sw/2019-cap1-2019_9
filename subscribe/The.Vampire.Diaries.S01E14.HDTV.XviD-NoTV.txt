00:00:00	Previously on "The Vampire Diaries..."
		지난 이야기
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:02	For over a century,
		한 세기를 걸쳐
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	I have lived in secret... until now.
		지금까지 비밀을
		간직한채 살았다
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	I know the risk, but I have to know her.
		위험한 걸 알지만
		그녀를 알아야 한다
00:00:06	 
		 
00:00:06	Elena, She's a dead ringer For Katherine.
		엘레나, 캐더린과
		정말 똑닮았더군
00:00:08	 
		 
00:00:08	Our love for Katherine wasn't real, Damon.
		캐더린에 대한 우리의 사랑은
		진심이 아니었어
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	It was real for me.
		나한텐 진실했어
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	I'm going to bring her back.
		다시 살려낼거야
00:00:12	 
		 
00:00:12	There's a tomb underneath the church.
		교회 아래에 무덤이 있어
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
		그 묘에 캐더린이
		봉인되어있지
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	Tell me how to get in the tomb.
		무덤 안에 들어갈 방법을 알려줘
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:18	- The grimoire. - Where is it?
		- 주술책
		- 어디있어?
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	Check the journal. Jonathan Gibert's.
		일기장을 찾아봐
		조나단 길버트꺼
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:21	The grimoire. It was Emily's, right?
		주술책 말야
		에밀리꺼 맞지?
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	That's what you need to reverse the spell.
		주문을 역행시키는데
		필요한 거고
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	I'll help you.
		내가 도와줄게
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	You just couldn't live without me, huh?
		나 없이 살 수 없구나?
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	Your eye!
		네 눈이?
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:29	Where'd she go?
		걘 어디로 갔죠?
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	- Where'd who go? - Anna.
		- 누가 어딜가?
		- 애나요
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:33	Elena!
		엘레나!

00:00:54	
		 
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:49	I wouldn't. 
		나라면 안 그럴걸
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:55	Don't try to escape.
		탈출하려고 하지 마
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	Don't even move.
		움직이지도 말고
00:02:00	 
		 
00:02:00	Do you uerstand?
		이해했나?
00:02:02	 
		 
00:02:03	I understand.
		알았어
00:02:05	 
		 
00:02:15	Seriously?!
		진짜로?
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	I told her not to move!
		움직이지 말랬어
00:02:17	 
		 
00:02:17	I did that eye thing you taught me.
		네가 가르쳐준 대로
		눈으로 했다고
00:02:18	 
		 
00:02:19	You forgot the lesson about vervain.
		마편초에 대한
		강의는 까먹었구나
00:02:20	 
		 
00:02:20	She takes a vampire venom, duh!
		뱀파이어의 독약을
		먹었다고!
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:22	Who are you? What do you want?
		넌 누구야?
		뭘 원하길래?
00:02:23	 
		 
00:02:23	Doesn't matter.
		상관 없어
00:02:25	 
		 
00:02:39	Bonnie?
		보니?
00:02:41	 
		 
00:02:42	Oh, my god!
		세상에!

		The Vampire Diaries
		1x14 Fool Me Once
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:57	Anna took Elena.
		애나가 엘레나를 데려갔어
00:02:59	 
		 
00:02:59	Yeah, I got that from your 600 voicemails.
		그래, 네 음성메시지
		600개나 받아서 알아
00:03:02	 
		 
00:03:02	Damon, all night long, every single street in town,
		데이먼, 밤새 나는
		모든 동네의 거리를
00:03:04	 
		 
00:03:04	I've been searching.
		뒤지고 다녔어
00:03:06	 
		 
00:03:06	What if your blood hasn't passed out of her system?
		형의 피가 아직
		몸밖으로 배출되지 않았다면?
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:09	Well, then at least you know you'll see her again.
		최소한 다시 만날 수 있겠네
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	Please.
		제발
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	What do you know?
		아는 걸 알려줘
00:03:14	 
		 
00:03:14	You were with Anna. You at least know where she's living.
		애나와 같이 있었잖아
		어디사는지는 알지
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	Just tell me where I can find her.
		어디서 찾아야 하는지 알려줘
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	Nope.
		싫어
00:03:20	 
		 
00:03:20	You can go.
		가봐
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	Really.
		진짜
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:25	You know, all I can remember is hating you.
		 
00:03:26	You know, all I can remember is hating you.
		미웠던 일만
		생각하는 구나
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	There might have been a time when that was different,
		달랐던 시절이 있었는데
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	but your choices have erased anything good about you.
		형은 자신에 대한
		좋은 기억은 지워버렸지
00:03:34	 
		 
00:03:34	But see, I also know that you have just as much reason to hate me.
		날 미워할 이유가
		많은거 알아
00:03:39	 
		 
00:03:39	This all began with me.
		나 때문에 시작된 일인걸
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:42	Katherine got taken away from you
		캐더린을 빼앗겼지
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	because of me.
		나 때문에
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:50	And I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:54	Apology accepted.
		사과 받아들이지
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:59	So please,
		그러니까 제발
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	just tell me what you know.
		아는 걸 알려줘
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:03	Huh.
		 
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:04	It's Elena, Damon.
		엘레나라구
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	If you know something... tell me.
		아는게 하나라도 있으면
		말해줘
00:04:07	 
		 
00:04:13	I mean this sincerely.
		진심으로 말하는데
00:04:15	 
		 
00:04:16	I hope Elena dies.
		엘레나가 죽었음 좋겠어
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:28	Bonnie.
		보니
00:04:29	 
		 
00:04:29	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	Oh, you're ok!
		무사하구나!
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	- My head... - Come here.
		- 머리가..
		- 이리 와
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	Oh, my god! Ben is a...
		세상에
		벤은..
00:04:38	 
		 
00:04:38	Shh. They can hear.
		다 들어
00:04:41	 
		 
00:04:44	I was so stupid!
		난 참 멍청이야!
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	Oh, he had all of us fooled.
		우릴 다 속였어
00:04:48	 
		 
00:04:48	What's going on? Why are we here?
		어떻게 된거야?
		우린 왜 여기 있지?
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:50	It must have something to do with the tomb and Emily's spell book.
		그 묘랑 에밀리 주술책하고
		연관된 일인거봐
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	Spell book?
		주술책?
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:55	Damon said that it could be used
		데이먼이 그랬는데
		묘를 여는데
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	to open the tomb.
		사용할 수 있대
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	Why didn't I know about any of this?
		난 왜 하나도 몰랐지?
00:04:59	 
		 
00:05:01	I was trying to keep you out of it,
		너한테 피해 안가게 하려고 그랬어
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	hoping it would never come to this.
		이런 일이 일어나지
		않기많을 바라면서
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Come to what?
		어떤 일?
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:06	They need a witch...
		마녀가 필요해
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:08	to break the spell and let the vampires out.
		주문을 깨고
		뱀파이어들을 꺼내려면
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	- No way. - I know...
		- 말도 안돼
		- 알아
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:19	You're wasting your time.
		시간 낭비하는 거야
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	I'm not going to help you.
		난 돕지 않을 거야
00:05:22	 
		 
00:05:25	That's why she's here.
		그래서 그녀가
		여기 있지
00:05:27	 
		 
00:05:27	Motivation for you to behave...
		예절 바르게 행동하게
		유도를 시키려고
00:05:30	 
		 
00:05:30	You know, you shouldn't be so desperate.
		그렇게 빨리도
		넘어 오다니
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	You made it too easy.
		정말 쉽게 만들어줬지
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	She wants to talk to you.
		얘기하고 싶대
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:42	Elena Gilbert.
		엘레나 길버트
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:44	You really are Katherine's doppelganger.
		캐더린하고 정말 똑같군
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	You must have the Salvatore boys reeling.
		살바토어 형제를
		쉽게 꼬셨겠는 걸
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:50	Who are you?
		넌 누구야?
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	I'm Anna.
		애나야
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Your brother may have mentioned me.
		네 남동생이 내 얘길 했을텐데
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	I mean, we're, like, practically dating.
		우린 그러니까
		사귀는거나 다름없거든
00:06:00	 
		 
00:06:02	Ten kegs?
		맥주 10통?
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	You know how much damage we could do with ten kegs?
		10통 정도면 우리가
		얼마나 피해볼지 알아?
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	Duke's got it all hooked up.
		듀크가 다 준비해 놨는걸
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	Duke's a douche.
		듀크는 재수 없는 놈이야
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	Yeah, a douche with ten kegs.
		그래, 재수 없지만
		10통을 갖고 있지
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	Aka, my new best friend.
		내 새로운 단짝 친구라 할 수 있지
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	What's the problem, Gilbert?
		뭐가 문제야, 제레미?
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	Don't have one, Lockwood.
		문제 없는걸, 타일러
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	Yeah, I didn't think so.
		그런 것 같지 않은데
00:06:17	 
		 
00:06:17	- You ever get bored of it? - Of what?
		- 지겹지 않니?
		- 뭐가?
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	Yourself?
		네 자신이
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:24	Keep laughing, buddy.
		계속 비웃어
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	Hey, Jeremy.
		제레미
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	Where is Elena?
		엘레나 어디있니?
00:06:29	 
		 
00:06:29	I have been texting her and Bonnie
		엘레나랑 보니한테
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	all day about Duke's party.
		듀크 파티에 대해
		계속 문자 보냈는데
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	Uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.
		스테판 형하고
		어디 갔어요
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	I am so not going to be one of those girls
		난 새로 남자친구가 생겼다고
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:37	who disappears just because she has a new boyfriend.
		사라지는 그런 여자는
		되지 않을거야
00:06:38	 
		 
00:06:38	Who is Duke?
		듀크가 누군데요?
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	Some guy that graduated a couple years ago.
		몇 년 전에 졸업한 남자
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	And he throws a party every time he comes home from Duke.
		듀크대학교에서
		집에 올 때마다 파티를 열어
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	Wait, Duke goes to Duke?
		듀크대를 다니는 듀크라?
00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:48	His real name is Bob or something.
		실제 이름은
		밥인가 머래나
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	He's a total ass. But he buys the beer.
		진짜 싸가지는 없는데
		술을 사주니까
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:54	Maybe you should come.
		너도 오지 그래
00:06:55	 
		 
00:06:55	Uh, yeah. I don't think so.
		모르겠어요
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	No, seriously. Everyone goes.
		진짜. 다들 오는데
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	Even quiet loner little brothers.
		조용한 외톨이 남동생도 말이지
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:06	Think about it.
		생각해 봐
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:10	- Hey! - Hey.
		- 맷!
		- 안녕
00:07:11	 
		 
00:07:11	So I have a speech.
		할 말이 있어
00:07:13	 
		 
00:07:13	It is fully scripted and well-rehearsed.
		대본도 준비했고
		완전히 연습했어
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	Are you ready for it?
		준비됐니?
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	- You wrote a speech? - Yes.
		- 대본도 준비를 했다고?
		- 그래
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	It's a "You kissed me
		'네가 키스했고'
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	and I don't want things to be weird" speech.
		'우리 사이가 이상해지지 않길
		바란다'는 내용의 말이야
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	It's pre-emptive.
		선수 치는 거지
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	Pre-emptive.
		선수 친다
00:07:25	 
		 
00:07:25	Yeah, you know, in case you were having
		혹시나 네가
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	second thoughts or regrets
		다시 생각해보거나
		후회가 되거나
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	or were, like, ooged out...
		역겹게 느낀다거나
00:07:31	 
		 
00:07:31	Ooged, huh?
		역겹게 느낀다고?
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:33	Can I just get on with the speech part?
		말 계속 하게 해줄래?
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	Yeah, go for it.
		그래, 해봐
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	So I know that you don't think
		나도 잘 알아
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:39	that this is going to work out between us.
		우리 사이가 잘 안될수도 있단걸
00:07:40	 
		 
00:07:40	I just want to let you know that right here and right now,
		난 바로 지금 여기에서
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	I'm offering you an out.
		그만둘 기회를
		너한테 주는거야
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	Like an escape clause.
		탈출 조항을 말야
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	Why are you giving me an escape clause?
		탈출 조항?
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	I don't want to make assumptions about what it is we are doing here.
		여기 있는 걸 가지고
		추측하게 만들고 싶지 않아
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	Got it.
		알았어
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	So, if you would like to exercise it,
		그 조항을
		실행하고 싶다면
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	just let me know.
		알려만 줘
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	I'm good, but thanks.
		괜찮아
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:05	Ok.
		알았어
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	Good.
		좋아
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:09	Yeah. So...
		그럼..
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	- See you for Duke's Tonight. - Yeah.
		오늘 듀크 파티에서 보자 / 그래
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:18	Yes?
		응?
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	Hi there.
		안녕
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	I'm looking for Bonnie.
		보니 찾으러 왔는데요
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	She's not here.
		여기 없다네
00:08:24	 
		 
00:08:25	Oh, do you know when she would...
		언제쯤 올지..
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	Never.
		절대 안 와
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:30	You have quite an opinion for someone who doesn't know me.
		날 모르는 사람치고
		주장이 꽤 강한데
00:08:32	 
		 
00:08:33	You got some nerve knocking on a Bennett witch's door
		뻔뻔하게도 베넷 마녀집안의
		문을 두드리고
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	and asking her for anything.
		보니를 찾는군
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	What'd I do?
		제가 뭘 했길래요?
00:08:38	 
		 
00:08:38	Spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore,
		귀신들도 말을 해
		살바토어군
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	and so does my granddaughter.
		내 손녀도 마찬가지이고
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	You are no friend to us.
		자네는 우리의 친구가 아니지
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	Now get off my porch.
		이제 우리집 현관에서 비키게
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	Step outside and say that.
		밖으로 나오셔서
		그렇게 말씀해보시죠
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:57	I am not Bonnie.
		난 보니가 아니네
00:08:59	 
		 
00:08:59	You don't want to mess with me.
		날 건드리고 싶진 않을걸
00:09:01	 
		 
00:09:07	Bonnie's not going to open the tomb.
		보니는 무덤을
		열지 않을거야
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	Oh, I think she will.
		열걸
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	Do you really want Katherine out that bad?
		캐더린을 그렇게
		꺼내고 싶은거야?
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	Trust me.
		날 믿어
00:09:16	 
		 
00:09:16	No one I know wants to see that girl again.
		그녀를 보고 싶은 사람은
		한명도 없으니까
00:09:18	 
		 
00:09:18	Except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.
		데이먼 빼고
		사랑에 빠진 멍청이지
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	Then what is it?
		그럼 뭐 때문에?
00:09:24	 
		 
00:09:24	Or who is it?
		누구 때문인데?
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	My mother's in there.
		우리 엄마가 거기 계셔
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:30	Katherine couldn't help herself.
		캐더린은 가만히 있질 못했지
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	She just had toyed around
		살바토어 형제들을
		갖고 놀았어
00:09:34	 
		살바토어 형제들을
		갖고 놀았어
00:09:34	with both of the Salvatore brothers.
		살바토어 형제들을
		갖고 놀았어
00:09:36	 
		 
00:09:36	And when she got caught,
		그러다 정체가 발각됐을 때
00:09:38	 
		 
00:09:38	so did my mother.
		우리 엄마도 붙잡혔지
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:42	I watched Jonathan Gilbert take her away.
		조나단 길버트가
		그녀를 끌고가는 걸 봤어
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	I'm sorry.
		유감이다
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	You really mean that, don't you?
		방금 한 말 진심이구나?
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:52	Yeah, I think we'll skip the dead mom bonding
		둘다 엄마가 죽었다고
		유대감 쌓는건 넘어가고
00:09:55	 
		둘다 엄마가 죽었다고
		유대감 쌓는건 넘어가고
00:09:55	so you can start serving a purpose.
		둘다 엄마가 죽었다고
		유대감 쌓는건 넘어가고
00:09:55	so you can start serving a purpose.
		 
00:09:55	so you can start serving a purpose.
		본론으로 들어가자고
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	Which is what?
		그게 뭔데?
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	Leverage.
		목적의 수단
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:03	This belong to you? Ah, ah.
		네꺼지?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:09	Hmm.
		 
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	Elena, are you ok?
		엘레나, 괜찮니?
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	She's fine, for now.
		무사해. 지금은
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	Tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine.
		너한테 주술책이 있다면
		계속 무사할거야
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:18	I can get it.
		내가 가져 올게
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	Which means your brother has it.
		데이먼이 갖고 있단 뜻이구나
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:21	And I have the witch.
		나한텐 마녀가 있고
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:23	So one of you had better meet me
		너희 둘 중 한명
		30분 후에
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	in the very public town square in 30 minutes,
		사람이 넘치는
		마을 광장으로 오도록 해
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	so we can safely discuss
		그럼 우린 안전하게
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	how fun it's going to be to work together.
		협력하는게 얼마나
		재미있을지 토론할수 있을테니
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:34	Go ahead.
		 
00:10:36	Go ahead.
		계속하지 그래
00:10:36	 
		계속하지 그래
00:10:36	Grovel again. Oh, wait, no.
		비굴하게 나와
		아니, 잠깐
00:10:36	Grovel again. Oh, wait, no.
		 
00:10:39	 
		 
00:10:39	I don't care.
		난 신경 안쓴다
00:10:41	 
		 
00:10:46	I'm leaving.
		갈래
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:51	Keep them buttoned down.
		꽉 잠궈놓고 있어
00:10:53	 
		 
00:10:53	Compulsion won't work.
		우리 주문이
		통하질 않으니까
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	- Just use violence. - Right.
		폭력을 쓰는거야 / 그렇지
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	I got that.
		알았어
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:01	Sit. Behave.
		 
00:11:03	Sit. Behave.
		앉아. 예절바르게
00:11:04	 
		앉아. 예절바르게
00:11:04	You're the key to this.
		네가 이 일의 열쇠야
00:11:04	You're the key to this.
		 
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:07	Literally.
		말 그대로
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	The one who opens the door.
		문을 열 사람이지
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:11	Tell me, how long have you been a witch?
		얼마나 오랫동안
		마녀로 산거야?
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:14	Is there anything to drink here?
		여기 마실거 없니?
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:16	Are you offering?
		네가 좀 주려고?
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:19	There's water on the nightstand.
		침실 옆 탁자에
		물 있어
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:24	Hey. Can I have a sip?
		나도 한모금 마셔도 되?
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:36	Whoa! 
		 
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:41	Come back in, shut the door!
		 
00:11:42	Come back in, shut the door!
		들어와서, 문 닫아!
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	Don't hurt her!
		엘레나 해치진 마!
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	Don't make me!
		그럼 가만히 있어!
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:49	Lock it.
		잠그라고!
00:11:50	 
		 
00:12:00	Anna!
		애나!
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:02	Hey, what, uh,
		저기
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	what happened to you last night?
		어젯밤에 어떻게 된거야?
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	Sorry, I had to leave.
		미안, 빨리 집에 가야 되서
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:08	I told your sister to tell you.
		네 누나한테 전했는데
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	Oh, I haven't seen her.
		누나 못봤어
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	Well, I gotta run, so...
		빨리 가봐야 겠어
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	Hey, do you want to go to a party tonight?
		오늘밤에
		파티 안 갈래?
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:14	Do I what?
		뭐하러?
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	The guy that's throwing it is a total douche,
		정말 재수없는 남자가
		파티를 여는데
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	but it's, uh, it's supposed to be fun.
		재미있을 것 같아
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:19	I figured, you know, safety in numbers.
		둘이 가면
		안전할 것 같고
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:22	So you're finally ready to go out with me, are you?
		나랑 같이 데이트할
		준비가 된거구나?
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:25	It's been a while since I've been to a party,
		파티 가본지 오래라
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:26	and I kind of want to get back out there.
		그곳에 다시 가보고 싶거든
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	And not be such a loner.
		외톨이처럼 지내기도 싫고
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:31	And, uh, I like you.
		널 좋아해
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:34	You're fun, and you're also kind of
		넌 재미있어
		그리고
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	strange and lurky, but, uh, I guess I like that, too.
		좀 이상하고 끈질기긴 한데
		그것도 맘에 드는 것 같아
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:41	So, yeah, you should come to the party. With me.
		파티에 가자
		나랑 같이
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	It's in the woods by that old cemetery.
		숲속 묘지 근처에서 해
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:48	Oh.
		 
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	It's there, huh?
		거기서?
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	That sounds cool.
		재미있겠네
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	Uh, I'll meet you.
		거기서 보자
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	Oh... ok! Great!
		좋아!
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:57	Cool.
		잘됐네
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Ok! 
		 
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:07	Got a hot date,
		멋진 데이트상대 구한거야?
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	or are you just planning on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?
		아님 길버트가 전체를
		물어 뜯을 계획인거야?
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	A party, right next to the old cemetery.
		묘지 옆에서 하는
		파티래
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	Isn't that nice of them?
		참 친절도 하지?
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:18	Lots of warm bodies for starving vampires.
		굶주린 뱀파이어를 위한
		따끈한 시체들
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	I told you. I work alone.
		말했지. 혼자 일한다고
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	Yeah, so do I.
		나도야
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	But you're minus a witch
		하지만 넌
		마녀가 없고
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	and I'm minus spell book.
		난 주술책이 없어
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	So what do you say?
		어쩔래?
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	Stefan will come after you, You know that.
		스테판이 쫓아올거 알잖아
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	For messing with Elena.
		엘레나를 납치한 거 때문에
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:33	Then he won't be too happy if I kill her
		내가 원하는 걸 못 가져서
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	when I don't get what I want.
		엘레나를 죽이면
		참 슬퍼하겠네
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:40	When do you want to do this?
		언제 할건데?
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:45	God, it's like 1864 all over again.
		다시 1864년도로
		돌아간 것 같군
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	You Salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women.
		여자에 관해서라면
		너희 형제들은 참 한심해
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	Tonight. After sundown.
		오늘밤. 해지고 나서
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	Meet at the church.
		교회에서 봐
00:13:57	 
		 
00:14:00	Witches don't have eternal life, right?
		마녀들은 영생하지 않지?
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	So you guys can die.
		너희는 죽을 수 있네
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	Yeah, we can die.
		그래
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:11	Ah.
		 
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:13	That sucks.
		그거 안됐네
00:14:15	 
		 
00:14:18	Stefan!
		스테판!
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	Let's get outside.
		나가자
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:25	When the sun goes down,
		해가 지면
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	leave town.
		이 동네를 떠나
00:14:28	 
		 
00:14:28	If I ever see you again,
		널 다시 보면
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	I will kill you.
		죽을 줄 알아
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:39	How did you know where we were?
		어디 있었는지
		어떻게 알았져?
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	Many things can fuel a witch's power.
		많은 것들이
		마녀의 힘을 증폭시켜
00:14:44	 
		 
00:14:44	Worry, anger.
		걱정이나 분노
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	After Stefan told me that they had taken you, I had a lot of both.
		스테판이 네가 납치됐단 얘길 했을때
		두 감정을 다 느꼈단다
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	Simple locator spell was easy after that.
		그래서 위치를 찾는
		주문은 쉬웠지
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:55	I'm sorry.
		미안해요
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	About all of this.
		이 모든 일들이
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	Not as sorry as they're gonna be.
		그들만큼 미안하진 않을거다
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:03	So what do we do now?
		이제 어쩌지?
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:05	For now, you need to stay here.
		우선 넌 여기 있어
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	A prisoner, in my own home?
		우리 집에서
		포로로 있으라고?
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	I don't think so.
		글쎼다
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	I can't protect you if you leave the house.
		할머님이 집을 떠나면
		지켜드릴 수 없어요
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	We'll protect ourselves.
		우린 스스로 지킬거야
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	We need to let him have Katherine back.
		캐더린을 불러내게 둬야 해
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:18	He's not going to stop until he gets her.
		그녀를 갖기 전까지
		데이먼은 멈추지 않을거야
00:15:21	 
		 
00:15:21	If we help him, maybe that ends it.
		우리가 그를 도우면
		끝나게 될지 몰라
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
		아니, 원하는 걸
		가질 자격 없어!
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:25	What other choice do we have?
		다른 방법이 뭐가 있는데?
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:29	Witches are being pulled down by vampire problems.
		마녀들은 뱀파이어 문제에
		휘말려 버렸어
00:15:32	 
		 
00:15:32	As much as we tried to do to stay out of it.
		그 일에서 벗어나려
		최선을 다하지만 말이다
00:15:35	 
		 
00:15:36	I'll open the tomb.
		무덤은 내가 여마
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	You get your brother's girl,
		넌 네 형제의
		여자친구를 데려오고
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:41	and destroy the rest with fire.
		나머지는 불을 피워 파괴시키게
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:44	Then this will be all over.
		그럼 다 끝나게 될게야
00:15:47	 
		 
00:15:47	We still have to get Damon to agree.
		데이먼이 동의하게
		만들어야 해요
00:15:49	 
		 
00:15:49	He already agreed once.
		벌써 동의했는걸
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	Yeah, and then we double cross him.
		그랬는데 우리가
		두번이나 방해했지
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	So now he's angry.
		이제 화가 나있어
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	He's hurt. There's a difference.
		상처받은 거지
		그건 달라
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:57	I think I know what I have to do.
		어떻게 해야할지 알 것 같아
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:06	You've got to be kidding me.
		농담하는 거지
00:16:09	 
		 
00:16:12	It was Stefan.
		스테판이었어
00:16:13	 
		 
00:16:13	There was nothing I could...
		내가 할 수 있는 방법은..
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	Just shut up! Stop talking.
		입 다물어!
		그만 말하라고
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:22	Without the witch,
		마녀가 없으면
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	we don't have Damon or the grimoire.
		데이먼이나 주술책을
		가질 수 없어
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	Damon's not going to stop.
		데이먼은 멈추지 않을거야
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	He'll find a way to get in.
		들어갈 방법을 찾을테지
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:33	And we're going to be there when he does.
		우린 데이먼이 갈때
		거기 가있을거야
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:48	I'm going to have to change the locks.
		자물쇠 바꿔놔야 겠어
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	Did you stage a jailbreak?
		탈옥을 계획한거야?
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	- Stefan. - Oh, brother.
		- 스테판
		- 이런
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	Ever the white knight.
		제3의 구원자도 오셨네
00:16:57	 
		 
00:16:57	I convinced Bonnie To help you.
		보니한테 도와달라
		설득시켰어요
00:17:00	 
		 
00:17:00	I doubt that.
		의심 가는데
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	I'm not going to say that I'm sorry
		미안하단 말 안할거에요
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:04	we got the grimoire without you last night,
		어젯밤에 그쪽을 빼놓고
		주술책을 찾아낸거 말이죠
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	because I'm not, really.
		미안하진 않거든요, 정말로
00:17:09	 
		 
00:17:09	Well, at least you're honest.
		최소한 정직하네
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	I was protecting the people I love, Damon.
		사랑하는 사람을
		지키려던 거에요, 데이먼
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	But so were you,
		당신도 마찬가지죠
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	in your own, twisted way.
		당신만의
		뒤틀린 방식으로
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	And as hard as it is to figure,
		이해하기 힘든만큼
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	we're all on the same side,
		우린 모두 같은 편이에요
00:17:20	 
		 
00:17:20	after the same thing.
		같은 걸 쫓고 있죠
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	- Not interested. - Yes, you are.
		- 관심 없어
		- 있을걸요
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	Because you were willing to work With us yesterday.
		어제도 우리와 함께
		일하겠다고 했잖아요
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	Fool me once, shame on you.
		한번 속은
		내가 바보지
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	Ok, when we were in Atlanta,
		애틀랜타에 있을때
00:17:30	 
		 
00:17:30	why didn't you use your compulsion on me?
		나한테 주문 걸지 않은
		이유가 뭐죠?
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:35	Who's to say I didn't?
		안 걸은지 어떻게 알아?
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:39	You didn't.
		맞잖아요
00:17:40	 
		 
00:17:40	I know you didn't.
		안 한거 알아요
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	But you could have.
		그럴 수도 있었는데
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:48	You and I...
		당신하고 나 사이에는..
00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	we have something.
		특별한 게 있어요
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:55	An understanding.
		이해심 말이죠
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	And I know that my betrayal hurt you,
		내가 배신했던 걸로
		상처받은 거 알아요
00:18:00	 
		 
00:18:00	different from how it is with you and Stefan,
		당신과 스테판 사이와는
		다른 일이죠
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:03	But I'm promising you this now,
		하지만 지금
		약속할게요
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	I ll help you get Katherine back.
		캐더린 되찾는걸
		도와드릴게요
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:10	I wish I could believe you.
		날 믿어줬음 좋겠어요
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:16	Ask me if I'm lying now.
		내가 거짓말하나 물어봐요
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:28	You know I wouldn't stop, by the way,
		멈추지 않을거야
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	no matter what I do.
		내가 뭘 하든
00:18:32	 
		 
00:18:33	Then we'll deal With it.
		그럼 그걸 따라야 겠죠
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:48	I didn't compell you in Atlanta because we were having fun.
		애틀란타에 있을때 즐거워서
		주문을 안 건게 아냐
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:57	I wanted it to be real.
		진심이었길 바랬거든
00:18:59	 
		 
00:19:02	I'm trusting you.
		이제 널 믿어
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:06	Don't make me regret it.
		후회하지 않도록 해줘
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:23	The Duke party. I forgot.
		듀크 파티 말에요
		까먹었어요
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:25	I hope they stay clear of the church.
		교회쪽에서는
		어슬렁 안댔음 좋겠는데
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:27	Your hope, not mine.
		그건 네 희망사항이고
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	Elena, hey.
		엘레나
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	Elena, oh, my god. Where have you been?
		어디 있었던 거야?
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:33	Long story, no time to tell it.
		말하자면 길어
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	- Wasn't talking to you. - Sure you were.
		- 당신한테 말한거 아녜요
		- 물론 맞는걸
00:19:37	 
		 
00:19:37	We haven't met. I'm Matt.
		만난 적 없죠
		난 맷이에요
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:40	Matt, there's a reason we haven't met.
		여태껏 못 만났던 이유가 있어요
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	You and I are going that way.
		너랑 난 이쪽으로 가자
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	Ahhh. I'm sorry, you guys.
		미안해, 얘들아
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:50	We need to clear the debris away.
		부스러기들은 치워놔야 해
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	Set the torches like you asked.
		네 부탁대로
		햇불을 준비해
00:19:55	 
		 
00:19:55	We can get down now.
		이제 들어가도 돼
00:19:58	 
		 
00:19:58	What is that?
		그게 뭔데?
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	It's everything I need to destroy them.
		파괴해야 할 것들
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:04	Are you sure Damon will come back with her?
		데이먼이 엘레나와
		돌아올거라 확신하나?
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:10	Brother, witches.
		형제, 마녀분들
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	Everything ok?
		무슨일 없지?
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	I just want to get this over with.
		빨리 끝내고 싶어
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	Are we ready?
		준비됐니?
00:20:16	 
		 
00:20:16	I guess so.
		그런 거 같아
00:20:19	 
		 
00:20:23	Done!
		다 마셨다!
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:26	Hey, uh, I'll be right back.
		좀있다 돌아올게
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:30	Hey, man.
		제레미
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	Uh, you got any weed?
		너 마리화나 없냐?
00:20:35	 
		 
00:20:35	Wait, you're kidding me, right?
		농담하는 거지?
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	You act like a total dick every time we cross paths,
		우리가 마주칠 때마다
		재수없게 굴더니
00:20:40	 
		 
00:20:40	and now you want to party with me?
		이젠 나랑 같이
		파티하고 싶으시다?
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:42	I never go with you. I'm just asking question.
		너랑 절대 같이 안가
		그냥 묻는거야
00:20:44	 
		 
00:20:44	Dude, I don't get you, man.
		이해를 못하겠다
00:20:46	 
		 
00:20:46	It's a party.
		파티라고
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	You're a partier, ok?
		너도 파티 하지?
00:20:49	 
		 
00:20:49	There's no need to psychoanalyze it.
		정신 분석할 필요 없어
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	I don't party any more.
		난 더이상 파티 안해
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:51	And even if I did, it wouldn't be with you.
		한다고 쳐도
		너랑은 안해
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:54	No problem.
		문제 없어
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	Carry on just standing there, by yourself.
		계속 거기 서 있어봐
		너 혼자 말이지
00:20:58	 
		 
00:20:58	All alone.
		혼자서
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:00	The enemy of fun.
		재미의 적
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	Do you even have any friends?
		너 친구는 있냐?
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:16	Thank god
		다행이다
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:18	Weird hello, but ok.
		이상한 인사지만 괜찮아
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	What's the matter?
		무슨 일이야?
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:22	Uh, nothing. Nothing, just...
		아무것도, 그저..
00:21:25	 
		 
00:21:26	It's nothing.
		아무것도 아냐
00:21:29	 
		 
00:21:29	Come on, let's walk.
		어서 걷자
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:34	Air.
		공기여
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	Earth.
		흙이여
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	Fire.
		불이여
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:40	Water.
		물이여
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:42	That's it, just water from the tap?
		그냥 수돗물로
		하시는 거에요?
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:46	As opposed to what?
		뭐가 어때서?
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	I just figured maybe it would have to be blessed
		신성한 물이나
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	or mystical or something.
		비법이 필요한 줄 알았거든요
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:55	What's that?
		그게 뭐야?
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	It's for Katherine.
		캐더린을 위한거야
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:58	Gotta have something to get her going.
		기운돌게 해줘야 할 거 아냐
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:00	Unless your girl's offering a vein to tap.
		네 여자친구가
		정맥을 대준다면 모를까
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:06	Admit it...
		인정해
00:22:08	 
		 
00:22:08	You can't wait to get rid of me.
		내가 사라지길
		고대하고 있단걸
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:13	I can't wait to get rid of you.
		형이 사라지길
		고대하고 있어
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	Hmm.
		 
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:19	You ready?
		준비 됐니?
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:23	This place is wild.
		여기 굉장히 멋지다
00:22:25	You kinda like dead people, huh?
		 
		너 죽은 사람 좋아하는구나?
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	I'm strange, remember?
		나 원래 이상한 거 몰라?
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:30	You ok?
		괜찮니?
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:32	Yeah, yeah. Uh...
		응
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	This place makes me think about someone.
		여기 있으니까
		누군가 생각나서
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	A dead someone?
		죽은 사람?
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	No, no, just...
		아니..
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	someone I used to know.
		내가 알던 사람
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:45	So, uh, hey. 
		맞다
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	We made it all of, what, 37 minutes in that party?
		우리 뭐 파티
		37분간 즐겼네
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	Not your scene?
		네가 좋아하는
		주류가 아냐?
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	No, I'm not really sure what my scene is any more.
		내 취향이 뭔지도
		더이상 모르겠어
00:22:55	 
		 
00:22:55	Hmm.
		 
00:22:56	 
		 
00:22:56	So what do you say?
		어떠니?
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	You want to be part of my non-scene?
		내 비주류 모임의
		일원이 될래?
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:03	I would happily be a part of your non-scene,
		기꺼이 비주류 모임에
		일원이 될래
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	except, uh, I'm leaving.
		가야된단 거 빼고
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:10	Wait, what?
		잠깐. 뭐라고?
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
		엄마랑 이사가게 됐어
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:15	Oh, uh...
		그거 참..
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	That's... That's a bummer.
		충격적이다
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:21	- Yeah? - Well, yeah.
		- 그래?
		- 응
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:24	So...
		그럼
00:23:26	 
		 
00:23:26	Guess this is good-bye.
		작별인사 해야겠네
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	I guess it is.
		그런 것 같다
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:43	Anna, your face!
		애나, 네 얼굴이!
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	It's nothing.
		아무것도 아냐
00:23:45	 
		 
00:23:45	It didn't look like nothing.
		아무것도 아닌것
		같지 않던데
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:50	You didn't have to hit him that hard.
		그렇게 세게 때릴
		필요 없잖아
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:52	Yes, I did.
		필요 있었거든
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:57	Grab him, and let's go.
		제레미 들고 가
00:23:59	 
		 
00:23:59	I'm taking him to meet my mother.
		엄마한테 데려갈거야
00:24:02	 
		 
00:24:09	Swoop!
		놀랐지
00:24:10	 
		 
00:24:10	Hey!
		타일러!
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	Ahh.
		 
00:24:12	 
		 
00:24:12	Where's your date?
		네 데이트 상대는 어딨어?
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	Who knows?
		누가 알아?
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:15	Ah, is the honeymoon over already?
		벌써 신혼이 끝난거야?
00:24:17	 
		 
00:24:17	Maybe.
		어쩌면
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:19	After all that grief you gave me about liking her.
		좋아한다고 나한테
		질질짤땐 언제고
00:24:21	 
		 
00:24:21	I figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes.
		너희 사이가
		5분은 넘길줄 알았는데
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:23	Look, I just... I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing.
		그게.. 공개적으로
		사귈수 있을지 모르겠어
00:24:26	 
		 
00:24:26	She... she seems like she might be a little clingy.
		약간 나한테 매달리거든
00:24:29	 
		 
00:24:30	Well, good.
		좋아
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	I need my boy single anyway.
		내 친구가 싱글이면 더 좋으니
00:24:32	 
		 
00:24:33	Ooh.
		 
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	Incoming.
		오고 있네
00:24:36	 
		 
00:24:36	Hey.
		맷
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	- There you are. - Here I am.
		- 여기 있었네
		- 그렇지
00:24:40	 
		 
00:24:41	Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough,
		덜 취한 것 같네
00:24:43	 
		 
00:24:43	so I'm just going to go get another beer.
		한잔 더 마셔야 겠다
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:47	So...
		그럼..
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	So.
		So.
00:24:51	 
		 
00:24:51	I have another speech.
		또 할 말을 준비했어
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	Ok.
		좋아
00:24:54	 
		 
00:24:54	The hand thing with Elena,
		아까 나랑 손 잡은거
00:24:58	 
		 
00:24:58	it was lame.
		참 유치한 짓이었어
00:24:59	 
		 
00:24:59	Well, I was lame.
		나도 유치했고
00:25:02	 
		 
00:25:02	And, hey, your feelings for Elena inside,
		넌 엘레나에 대해 감정이 있지
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	Damon was there,
		데이먼도 거기 있었고
00:25:06	 
		 
00:25:06	and he was always such a jerk to me.
		데이먼은 늘 나한테
		나쁘게 굴었어
00:25:09	 
		 
00:25:09	And...
		또..
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:11	I wanted to show off that I was with the good guy.
		착한 남자랑 사귄단걸
		보여주고 싶었거든
00:25:13	 
		 
00:25:13	So, anyway, I was lame.
		어쨌든 내가 유치했어
00:25:17	 
		 
00:25:18	So...
		그럼..
00:25:19	 
		 
00:25:19	Forgiven?
		용서해줄래?
00:25:22	 
		 
00:25:23	Yeah, of course.
		물론이지
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:25	Yeah.
		그래
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:40	What are they saying?
		뭐라고 하는 거야?
00:25:41	 
		 
00:25:42	Sounds Latin.
		라틴어 같은데
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:43	I don't think it's Latin.
		라틴어 아냐
00:25:45	 
		 
00:26:00	What's happening?
		무슨 일이죠?
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:07	It worked!
		주문이 통했어
00:26:09	 
		 
00:26:10	Of course it worked.
		물론 통하고 말고
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	Weave some fires to build.
		불을 좀 피워봐
00:26:14	 
		 
00:26:14	I'm gonna go get the gasoline, I'll be right back.
		휘발유 가져올게
		곧 돌아올거야
00:26:17	 
		 
00:26:22	- You ready? - What?
		- 준비됐니?
		- 뭐가요?
00:26:25	 
		 
00:26:25	You think I'm going to go in there by myself.
		나 혼자 들어갈 줄 알았어?
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	- So you can seal me in? - Don't take her in.
		- 날 봉인하시려고?
		- 엘레나는 데려가지 말게
00:26:28	 
		 
00:26:28	I'll bring the walls down.
		내가 벽을 무너뜨릴테니
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	You'll bring walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
		내가 못하면 그러시겠죠
		당신을 믿는줄 알아요?
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:33	- As much as I trust you. - Enough!
		- 나만큼은 믿겠지
		- 그만하세요!
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	Both of you.
		두분 다 말예요
00:26:36	 
		 
00:26:36	Look, he needs leverage.
		제3자가 필요해요
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	He needs to know that you're not going
		안에 들어가면
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	to shut the door when he gets inside.
		문 안 닫을거라 확신하려면요
00:26:40	 
		 
00:26:40	I get it.
		알겠네
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	I'll go.
		갈게요
00:26:43	 
		 
00:26:43	May I?
		그럼
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:56	Dark down there?
		안은 많이 어둡나?
00:26:59	 
		 
00:27:00	I thought I told you to leave.
		떠나라고 했을텐데
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	I considered it.
		곰곰히 생각해봤어
00:27:05	 
		 
00:27:05	Then I thought, screw you.
		근데 떠오른게
		널 따를게 뭐있나 싶더라
00:27:08	 
		 
00:27:08	Hey, hero.
		영웅님
00:27:09	 
		 
00:27:09	I'm going down there to get my mother.
		우리 엄마를 구하러
		내려 갈거야
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:11	Can't let you do that.
		그렇게 못해
00:27:13	 
		 
00:27:13	Well, Ben's about to make a main course
		벤은 엘레나 남동생으로
00:27:15	 
		 
00:27:15	out of Elena's little brother,
		메인코스 요리를
		만들 참이야
00:27:17	 
		 
00:27:17	So you can stop me or him.
		날 막든 벤을 막든
00:27:21	 
		 
00:27:21	Your choice.
		네가 선택해
00:27:23	 
		 
00:27:35	What is that?
		저게 뭐죠?
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:37	They can sense you.
		그들은 널 감지해
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:40	Where is she?!
		캐더린은 어디있지?
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	Damon!
		데이먼!
00:27:46	 
		 
00:27:47	Hey, you're not going in there.
		안에 들어가진 않을거지?
00:27:49	 
		 
00:27:49	You think you can stop me?
		날 막을 수 있을것 같아?
00:27:51	 
		 
00:27:51	Bonnie...
		보니..
00:27:54	 
		 
00:28:05	Why did you let her go in?
		왜 들어가게 내버려뒀죠?
00:28:06	 
		 
00:28:06	Because she isn't coming out, baby.
		나오지 않을테니까
00:28:09	 
		 
00:28:09	None of them are.
		모두가
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:13	Do you really think that she cares about you?
		널 정말 좋아하는줄 알아?
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:16	Hmm?
		 
00:28:17	 
		 
00:28:17	You're disposable.
		곧 널 버릴거야
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:19	I don't care. She already gave me what I want.
		상관 없어
		내가 원하는걸 줬는걸
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:22	You're going to say "Eternal life"?
		'영생'을 말하는 거야?
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:24	You're really that stupid?
		그렇게 멍청하니?
00:28:26	 
		 
00:28:26	You know, I've heard about you.
		너에 대해 들었어
00:28:30	 
		 
00:28:30	You don't feed.
		인간 피는 안 먹는다며
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:33	You're not strong enough to beat me.
		날 이길만큼 강하지 못해
00:28:36	 
		 
00:28:39	Is that all you got?
		그것밖에 안돼?
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	No.
		아니
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:42	I got this.
		이게 있어
00:28:45	 
		 
00:28:58	Damon?
		데이먼?
00:29:01	 
		 
00:29:01	Damon!
		데이먼!
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:42	Aahh!
		 
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:53	Where's Elena?
		엘레나는 어딨죠?
00:29:54	 
		 
00:29:54	Damon took her inside.
		데이먼이 안으로 끌고 갔어
00:29:56	 
		 
00:29:56	What?! Stefan!
		- 뭐라고?
		- 스테판!
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	If you go in there, you won't come out.
		안에 들어가면
		나오지 못할거네
00:30:00	 
		 
00:30:01	What did you do?
		어떻게 하신거죠?
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:03	Opening the door didn't remove the seal,
		문을 열었지만
		봉인을 풀지 않았네
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:04	It just opened the door.
		단지 문만 열은것 뿐이지
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:07	What's the seal?
		봉인이 뭐죠?
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:09	Some seals keep vampires from entering.
		뱀파이어가 들어오는 걸
		막는 봉인도 있어
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:11	This one keeps them from...
		이 봉인은 그들이...
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	coming out.
		나오는 걸 막지
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	Elena's human.
		엘레나는 인간이니까
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	She can leave.
		나올 수 있군요
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	Anna and Katherine can't.
		애나와 캐더린은
		못 나오고요
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	Damon can't.
		데이먼도 말이죠
00:30:24	 
		 
00:30:24	You weren't even planning on breaking the spell,
		주문을 깨려던 계획도
		애초에 없었군요?
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	were you?
		맞죠?
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:27	I told you.
		말했잖나
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:30	I'll protect my own.
		난 우리 종족만 지킨다고
00:30:32	 
		 
00:30:32	Elena can get out. That's all that matters.
		엘레나는 나올 수 있어
		그게 제일 중요하지
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:37	You must have a taste for it.
		한번 맛보는게 어때
00:30:40	 
		 
00:30:40	You scream and shriek and even bother to escape,
		넌 날카롭게 비명지르며
		탈출할 궁리만 하는데
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	but then you just come right back to it.
		넌 다시 원점으로
		돌아와 버렸지
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	Oh, oh!
		 
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	Mother!
		엄마!
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:53	Your boyfriend did this, you know.
		네 남자친구가
		이렇게 만들었어
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	His father did.
		아버지가 그런거야
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:56	And Jonathan Gilbert.
		조나단 길버트도 마찬가지고
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	Made a choice a long time ago
		오래전에 선택을 했지
00:30:58	 
		 
00:30:58	that it would be Gilbert's blood
		그녀를 살려내기 위해선
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:00	that brought her back to life.
		길버트 가의 피를
		먹여야 한다고
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	I had Jeremy all ready to go,
		제레미는 벌써
		갈 준비가 되있고
00:31:03	 
		 
00:31:03	but...
		하지만..
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:11	Stefan!
		스테판!
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:14	You can't just leave him in there, Grams!
		들어가게 하면 어떡해요, 알머니!
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	He made his choice!
		스스로 선택을 한거야!
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	No.
		아뇨
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	Here.
		여기요
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	Just tell me what to do. I'll do it!
		뭘 해야될지 말해주세요
		제가 할게요!
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:25	We are not strong enough.
		우린 그만큼 강하지 못해
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:26	Even if we were able to bring the seal down,
		봉인을 풀 수 있대도
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	there's no guarantee that we can get it back up again.
		다시 힘을 되찾으리라
		보장을 못한다
00:31:31	 
		 
00:31:32	You said it yourself...
		직접 말씀하셨잖아요
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	many things can fuel a witch's power.
		많은 것들이 마녀의 힘을
		증대시킬 수 있다고
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	Help me!
		도와줘요!
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	or I'll do it alone.
		아님 혼자 할게요!
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:51	Please don't!
		제발 하지마!
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:55	Let her go!
		놔줘!
00:31:57	 
		 
00:31:57	No!
		안돼!
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	Go, go. I'll be right behind you.
		가. 바로 따라갈게
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:03	Anna!
		애나!
00:32:05	 
		 
00:32:08	Where am I?
		여기가 어디지?
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:18	Elena, Stefan...
		엘레나, 스테판은?
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	He's right behind me.
		바로 뒤따르고 있어
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:26	Stefan, what are you doing?
		스테판, 뭐하는거야?
00:32:28	 
		 
00:32:28	It's gonna be ok. We'll fix it.
		괜찮아. 우리가 고칠거야
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:31	What is it?
		무슨 말이야?
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	I can't.
		할수 없어
00:32:33	 
		 
00:32:33	Can't? Can't what?
		할수 없다니? 뭘?
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	The spell's still up, we can't get them out.
		아직 주문이 깨지지 않아서
		나올 수가 없어
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	Yet.
		아직까지는
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	You went in there not knowing
		다시 나올지 모른채로
00:32:40	 
		 
00:32:40	if you could come back out?
		거기 들어간거야?
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:45	Oh, my god.
		세상에
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:46	I heard you scream.
		소리지르는 거 들었어
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	We can't leave him in there.
		데이먼을 그 안에 둘 수 없어
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	We promised him, both of us.
		약속했잖아. 우리 둘 다
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	I know.
		알아
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	Even if we're able to break through the seal,
		봉인을 풀 수 있대도
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:56	we won't be able to hold it for long.
		오랫동안 지속되진 못할걸세
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:06	- She's not here! - Damon.
		- 캐더린은 여기 없어!
		- 데이먼
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	She's not here.
		여기 없어
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	What?
		뭐라고?
00:33:11	 
		 
00:33:11	She's not here!
		캐더린이 없다고!
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:28	I think it's working!
		 
00:33:29	I think it's working!
		효과가 있는 거 같아!
00:33:31	 
		 
00:33:34	I just wanted my mother back.
		엄마를 되찾고 싶었을 뿐야
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:36	Jeremy's fine. He's outside. We won't touch him.
		제레미는 무사해
		밖에 있어. 안 건드릴게
00:33:40	 
		 
00:33:42	Bonnie! Keep going!
		보니! 계속 하거라!
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:45	You better hurry.
		서두르게
00:33:46	 
		 
00:33:46	Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!
		스테판, 빨리 나와야 해!
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:56	Damon, we need to get out of here.
		데이먼, 빨리 나가자
00:33:58	 
		 
00:33:58	It doesn't make sense. They locked her inside.
		이해가 안돼
		안에 가둬놨는데
00:33:59	 
		 
00:33:59	If we don't leave now,
		지금 안 나가면
00:34:00	 
		 
00:34:00	we're not getting out.
		아예 못 나와
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:02	How could she not be in here?
		어떻게 여기 없는거지?
00:34:04	 
		 
00:34:04	It's not worth spending all of eternity down here!
		그렇다고 영원히
		이 안에서 살 가치는 없잖아
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	- She's not worth it! - No!
		- 그럴 필요 없어!
		- 아니!
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	Damon!
		데이먼
00:34:10	 
		 
00:34:12	Please.
		제발요
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:30	Oh, my god!
		세상에
00:34:32	 
		 
00:34:33	I can't!
		못하겠어요
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:34	Yes, you can!
		할 수 있어!
00:34:35	 
		 
00:35:07	Is this for real?
		진짜야?
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	Is what for real?
		뭐가?
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	You being all cool and honest and open?
		쿨하고 정직하고
		공개적인 모습이?
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:19	Speech number three
		3번째로 준비한 얘기
00:35:21	 
		 
00:35:21	I want this to work.
		잘 됐으면 좋겠어
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:24	And I'm scared that you're going to change your mind
		네가 마음을 바꿀까 두려워
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:26	and you're not going to want it.
		원하지 않게 될까봐
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:29	I don't want to mess it up.
		망치고 싶지도 않고
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	I don't want to mess it up, either.
		나도 망치고 싶지 않아
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:48	He's ok.
		괜찮아
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:50	He's all right.
		무사해
00:35:52	 
		 
00:36:14	I'm sorry.
		미안
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:32	Hey, let me help you.
		내가 도와줄게
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	Oh, I'm fine.
		괜찮아
00:36:35	 
		 
00:36:35	You don't need to coddle me, baby.
		내 걱정 말거라
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:38	It was a big spell, Grams.
		강력한 주문이었는걸요
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	I could tell it took a lot out of you.
		많은 힘을 쓰신 거 알아요
00:36:41	 
		 
00:36:41	I'll be fine.
		괜찮을거야
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:54	How's your head?
		머리는 좀 어떠세요?
00:36:55	 
		 
00:36:55	It's, uh, it's all right.
		괜찮다
00:36:56	 
		 
00:36:56	I just... I wish I knew how I pass out.
		어떻게 기절했는지
		알고 싶어
00:36:58	 
		 
00:36:59	I didn't drink that much, I swear.
		그렇게 많이 마시지도 않았는데
00:37:01	 
		 
00:37:01	And you don't remember anything?
		아무것도 기억 안나?
00:37:03	 
		 
00:37:03	The whole thing's pretty cloudy. I just...
		기억이 몽롱해
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:06	I know how this looks.
		어떻게 보이는지 알아
00:37:07	 
		 
00:37:07	I'm... I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:09	No, Jeremy, don't be sorry.
		아니, 제레미
		미안해하지 마
00:37:10	 
		 
00:37:10	You didn't do anything, ok?
		넌 아무것도 안했어
00:37:12	 
		 
00:37:12	Ok.
		알았어
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:14	I've gotta head over to Bonnie's for a little bit,
		보니네 잠깐 들렀다 올건데
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	but is there anything that you need?
		뭐 필요한 거 없어?
00:37:19	 
		 
00:37:19	Oh, no, I'm just... I'm gonna crash.
		응.. 그냥 잠 좀 잘래
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	Ok. Well, Jenna's here, and I'll be back soon.
		제나 이모 있으니까
		나도 곧 돌아올게
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:38	
		 
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:54	You knew Katherine wasn't in there.
		캐더린이 없는거
		알고 있었지
00:37:57	 
		 
00:37:57	You wouldn't have helped me.
		알았으면 날 돕지 않았을 거잖아
00:37:59	 
		 
00:37:59	No!
		안돼!
00:38:00	 
		 
00:38:00	Why do you get happiness?
		그럼 당신은 왜 거기 있었지?
00:38:02	 
		 
00:38:02	Damon, please, you wouldn't have helped me! You know you wouldn't!
		데이먼, 제발
		날 안 도왔을거잖아!
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	Why do you get it and I don't?!
		왜 당신은 있었고
		캐더린은 없었지?
00:38:06	 
		 
00:38:06	The guard, the way of the judge,
		교회에 있었던
		그 문지기
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	they really want this thing!
		우리를 가뒀던 사람
00:38:09	 
		 
00:38:09	She promised to turn him.
		그를 뱀파이어로
		만들어주겠다 약속을 했어
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:12	He was obsessed with her.
		그 남자는
		캐더린에 빠져있었어
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	She had him under her spell, like everybody else!
		다른 이들처럼
		그에게 주문을 걸었던 거야
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:20	He let her go.
		그녀를 풀어줬지
00:38:21	 
		 
00:38:24	The last I saw her
		마지막으로 봤을때
00:38:27	 
		 
00:38:27	was Chicago.
		시카고에 있었어
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	1983.
		1983년에
00:38:32	 
		 
00:38:32	She knew where you were, Damon.
		네가 어디있는지
		캐더린도 알았어
00:38:34	 
		 
00:38:36	She didn't care.
		신경을 안 썼을 뿐이지
00:38:39	 
		 
00:38:42	Sorry.
		미안
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:58	I just got to Bonnie's.
		보니네 가야겠어
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:01	- Everything all right? - Yeah.
		- 무슨 일 없지?
		- 응
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	How's Damon? Is he going to be ok?
		데이먼은 어때?
		괜찮아질까?
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:08	Can I call you later?
		나중에 전화할까?
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:10	Yeah, of course.
		물론이지
