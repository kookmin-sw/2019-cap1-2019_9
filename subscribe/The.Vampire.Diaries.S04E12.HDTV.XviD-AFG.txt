		또 그 아래 뱀파이들이 만든건
		말할것도 없이 다 죽을거야
00:04:14	 
		 
00:04:15	which means the hunter's mark will be complete,
		그건 곧 헌터의 표식이
		완성된다는거지
00:04:18	 
		 
00:04:18	And we'll have our key to finding the cure.

00:06:05	You've come to snap my neck again?
		목 부러뜨리러 왔냐?

00:06:09	Because I woke up feeling completely unmurderous,

00:06:11	and I'm pretty sure that it's safe to set me free.

00:06:25	At least spring for a bag or something.
		적어도 혈액팩
		정도는 되야지
00:06:27

00:06:48	 
		 
00:06:49	What the hell are you doing here?
		넌 여기 왜 왔어?
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	Babysitting.
		애 보러
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:55	Give him a vial of blood every couple of hours
		2시간마다 줘
00:06:58	Give him a vial of blood every couple of hours
		 
00:06:58	so he doesn't desiccate.
		말라 죽지 않게
00:06:59	 
		 
00:07:00	If he gets too much strength back
		힘을 되찾거나
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	or if he just annoys you,
		널 짜증나게 하면
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:05	bleed him out again.
		피 흘리게 냅둬
00:07:06	 
		 
00:07:08	Silent treatment, huh?
		푸대접하겠다?
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:10	Is that your best shot?
		그게 다야?
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:13	He's still pissed at me for sleeping with Elena.
		엘레나랑 잤다고
		아직도 열받았거든
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	Are you sure about that?
		그렇게 생각해?
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:18	Because I caught him trying to sneak out
		레베카 침대에서 몰래
		빠져나오는거 내가 봤거든
00:07:19	of Rebekah's bed this morning,
		레베카 침대에서 몰래
		빠져나오는거 내가 봤거든
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	which would suggest to me that he's moved on.
		내가 보기엔
		정리한것 같더라고
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:25	Well, well. Looks like my brother

00:07:34	 
		악당 둘이
		재밌게 놀지 그래?
00:07:34	villain bonding time?
		악당 둘이
		재밌게 놀지 그래?
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:37	I'll let you know when I get the dagger from Rebekah.
		레베카한테서 단검
		찾으면 알려줄게
00:07:39	 
		 
00:07:56	Damon is fine.
		데이먼은 괜찮아
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	I locked him with all the creature comforts he deserves.
		원하는 건
		다 들어주고 있어
00:07:59	I locked him with all the creature comforts he deserves.
		 
00:07:59	That's not why I called.
		그것때문에
		전화한게 아냐
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	Kol just tried to kill Bonnie.
		콜이 보니를
		죽이려고 했어
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:04	What? Is she ok?
		뭐?
		괜찮데?
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:06	Yeah, just shaken up.
		응 충격만 받았어
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	She managed to hold him off, but kol seems pretty intent
		붙잡아는 뒀지만
00:08:10	She managed to hold him off, but kol seems pretty intent
		 
00:08:10	She managed to hold him off, but kol seems pretty intent
		치료제를 찾는 사람은
		다 죽이려고 해
00:08:11	on murdering anyone who's looking for that cure.
		치료제를 찾는 사람은
		다 죽이려고 해
00:08:13	on murdering anyone who's looking for that cure.
		 
00:08:13	Yeah. Klaus has me trying to convince Rebekah
		그래서 클라우스가
		레베카를 설득하려고 했어
00:08:15	Yeah. Klaus has me trying to convince Rebekah
		 
00:08:15	to give up her dagger so we can take care of Kol.
		단검 받아서
		콜을 처리하려고
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:17	I don't want to just dagger Kol.
		난 단지 단검만
		꽂으려는게 아냐
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:20	I want Jeremy to kill him.
		제레미가 콜을
		죽였으면 좋겠어
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:29	What did you just say?
		뭐라고?
00:08:29	What did you just say?
		 
00:08:29	Bonnie says she's got all this crazy new power.
		보니가 새로운 힘이
		생겼다고 했어
00:08:32	Bonnie says she's got all this crazy new power.
		 
00:08:32	She thinks she can hold him long enough
		제레미한테 기회를
		주기 충분하게
00:08:34	She thinks she can hold him long enough
		 
00:08:34	for Jeremy to get a clean shot.
		붙잡아둘수 있다고 했어
00:08:35	for Jeremy to get a clean shot.
		 
00:08:35	And then what, huh?
		그리고 나선?
00:08:36	 
		 
00:08:36	Klaus and Rebekah will kill every single one of us
		클라우스랑 레베카가
		우리를 죽이려들걸
00:08:38	Klaus and Rebekah will kill every single one of us
		 
00:08:38	out of spite.
		그것도 아주 열심히
00:08:39	 
		 
00:08:39	They may be dysfunctional, bickering lunatics,
		가정문제도 있고
		미치도록 싸울진 몰라도
00:08:41	 
		 
00:08:41	but they stick together no matter what.
		무슨일이 있어도
		함께 해 왔어
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	That's why you need to find the dagger
		그래서 네가
		단검을 찾아서
00:08:45	That's why you need to find the dagger
		 
00:08:45	and use it on Rebekah.
		레베카한테
		꽂아야 하는거야
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:47	She can't come looking for revenge if she's lying in a box.
		관에 누우면
		복수를 할수 없으니까
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:52	Yeah, I can't do that.
		그렇겐 못해
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	I know you can't because vampires can't use the dagger,
		뱀파이어는 단검을 꽂지
		못하니까 넌 못하겠지
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	but Matt can.
		그치만 맷은 가능해
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:58	It's not like she doesn't deserve it.
		레베카는 그런일
		당해도 싸잖아
00:08:59	 
		 
00:09:02	And bonnie thinks that she can get Klaus out of the picture, too,
		보니가 클라우스도
		문제될건 없다고 하네
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	At least temporarily.
		적어도 잠시동안은
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	Once we get this cure, none of this will matter
		치료제만 얻으면
		문제될건 없어
00:09:08	Once we get this cure, none of this will matter
		 
00:09:08	because we can use it against them.
		그들한테 불리하게
		사용하면 되니까
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:11	All right, fine, but how do you plan to lure Kol in?
		좋아 알았어 그런데
		콜은 어떻게 꾀어낼건데?
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:21	Jeremy Gilbert.
		제레미 길버트
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:23	Nice to see I'm still on your speed dial, mate.
		내 번호 저장해둔거
		보기 좋네 친구야
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:26	Hey, you want to meet up at the batting cages in Denver?
		덴버에 있는 야구 연습장에
		가보지 않을래?
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:29	Actually, it's Elena Gilbert.
		실은 엘레나 길버트야
00:09:31	 
		 
00:09:32	What a treat.
		전화 예의 하고는
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:33	Yeah, I was just thinking of all the clever ways
		현명한 방법을
		생각하고 있었어
00:09:35	Yeah, I was just thinking of all the clever ways
		 
00:09:35	I could have your brother killed,
		네 동생을
		죽일수도 있고
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:38	but I'd settle for ripping off
		대신에 문신그려진 팔
		뜯는거로 만족하려고
00:09:39	 
		대신에 문신그려진 팔
		뜯는거로 만족하려고
00:09:39	his illustrated arm instead.
		대신에 문신그려진 팔
		뜯는거로 만족하려고
00:09:40	 
		 
00:09:41	I need to talk to you--in person.
		만나서 얘기
		하고 싶어
00:09:44	 
		 
00:09:45	I want to call a truce in the name of Silas.
		사일러스를 두고
		휴전하고 싶어
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:51	You want to talk about silas?
		사일러스에 대해
		말하고 싶다고?
00:09:52	 
		 
00:09:52	I'll meet you wherever you want.
		부르는대로 갈게
00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	I'll come to you.
		내가 갈게
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:56	I'll tell you what.
		저기 말이야
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	How about I come to you?
		내가 가는건 어때?
00:09:59	 
		 
00:10:05	If you want to truce,
		휴전을 원하면
00:10:06	 
		 
00:10:06	open the door and invite me in.
		문열고
		나 초대해
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:15	I'm waiting.
		기다리잖아
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:17	Let me in, and let's talk truce.
		들여보내고
		휴전 얘기 해야지
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:22	Wouldn't it be kind of stupid to invite you in?
		어서 / 초대하는건
		멍청한짓 아닐까?
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	On the contrary.
		반대로
00:10:26	On the contrary.
		 
00:10:26	I can't kill your brother with my own two hands,
		내 손으로 네 동생을
		죽이진 못해
00:10:29	I can't kill your brother with my own two hands,
		 
00:10:29	or I'll suffer the hunter's curse
		헌터의 저주에
		시달리게 되고
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	and spend the next 20 years trying to off myself in gruesome ways.
		다음 20년을 섬뜩함에서
		벗어나려고 애써야되니까
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:36	And I heard that vervain is back in town
		마편초가 다시 마을에
		흘러들었다고 들었어
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	so I can't compel you to kill him either.
		너보고 죽이라고
		주술도 걸 수 없지
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:42	So I think it's fair to say
		그러니까
		공평한것 같은데
00:10:44	So I think it's fair to say
		 
00:10:44	you're semi-safe, for now.
		반은 안전하다고
		할 수 있지 지금은 말이야
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:48	I'm the only one that could invite him inside.
		초대할 수 있는 사람은
		나 뿐이야
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:51	He's right, obviously.
		제레미 말이 맞아
		뻔한거 아냐
00:10:53	 
		 
00:11:01	You'd think being alive for over 1,000 years
		1000년 넘게
		살았는데
00:11:03	You'd think being alive for over 1,000 years
		 
00:11:03	would teach me some manners,
		매너가 있을거라
		생각하겠지만
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	but I couldn't resist stopping by.
		방문하지 않고는
		못배겼어
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:07	If I let you in, my brother goes.
		들여보내주면
		동생은 보내주는거야
00:11:09	 
		 
00:11:09	You're not getting near him.
		동생 근처엔 못가
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:12	Fair enough.
		알았어
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:17	You can come in.
		들어와
00:11:18	 
		 
00:11:21	No gold medal in bravery, I see.
		용감하다고 상은
		주지 않나보네
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:25	Another thing I love about the modern age is
		현대시대에
		마음에 드는건
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:28	music anytime you like.
		듣고 싶을때
		음악을 듣는거야
00:11:30	 
		 
00:11:34	So, it's the part you offer me a drink
		그럼 이쯤에서
		술한잔 권해야지
00:11:36	So, it's the part you offer me a drink
		 
00:11:36	so we can have a proper chat.
		그래야 수다를 떨지
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:50	 
		색깔이나 천이나
		80년대는 비극적이야
00:11:50	Colours are fabric, the eighties were just tragic.
		색깔이나 천이나
		80년대는 비극적이야
00:11:54	Colours are fabric, the eighties were just tragic.
		 
00:11:54	Colours are fabric, the eighties were just tragic.
		패션에 반대한 죄로
00:11:54	You know, I think shoulder pads
		패션에 반대한 죄로
00:11:55	You know, I think shoulder pads
		 
00:11:55	rival 17th-century Puritan smocks for crimes against fashion.
		어깨뽕이랑 17세기 청교도
		작업복이 서로 경쟁했을걸
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:59	Looking for something to wear to the dance?
		춤추러 갈때
		입을 옷 골라?
00:12:01	 
		 
00:12:01	Aye. Are you asking me to a date?
		응 데이트 신청
		하는거야?
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:04	Actually, it was canceled.
		실은 취소됬어
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:12	So why are you here?
		그럼 여기 왜왔어?
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	Back for more dagger talk?
		단검 얘기 또 하러?
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:17	Somebody has some trust issues.
		누구는 남을
		못믿는것 같네
00:12:18	Somebody has some trust issues.
		 
00:12:18	It's called a healthy skepticism.
		회의적이라고 해줄래
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:22	I know you were trying to sneak out this morning.
		아침에 몰래
		나가려고 한거 알아
00:12:24	I know you were trying to sneak out this morning.
		 
00:12:24	I'm not stupid.
		바보는 아니야
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	Sorry.
		미안해
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:28	I'm still trying to get used to this.
		아직도 적응하려고
		노력중이야
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:30	Do you regret it?
		후회해?
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	No.
		아니
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	Do you want it to happen again?
		또 하고 싶어?
00:12:33	 
		 
00:12:36	Maybe.
		어쩌면
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:37	Even if I don't give you the dagger?
		단검 안준다해도?
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:40	You think that I would sleep with you
		너랑 자고
		싶어하는게
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:42	just to get the dagger?
		단지 단검을 얻기
		위해서라고 생각해?
00:12:44	just to get the dagger?
		 
00:12:44	Don't give me that innocent look.
		결백하다는것처럼
		표정짓지마
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:47	You've done plenty to me
		나한테 그런게
		한두번이 아니잖아
00:12:48	You've done plenty to me
		 
00:12:48	in the name of getting what you want.
		네가 원하는걸
		얻으려고
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:50	Well, I guess I should pack up these racks.
		옷걸이들은
		집어넣어야겠네
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Just another failed attempt at getting to a high-school dance.
		고등학교 댄스파티에
		가는거 또 한번 실패네
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:58	Why do you care so much about high-school dance?
		왜 고등학교 댄스파티에
		그렇게 신경써?
00:13:00	Why do you care so much about high-school dance?
		 
00:13:00	I don't. I was just bored.
		아니거든
		그냥 지겨워서 그래
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	Right.
		그래
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:05	We can also go, if you want.
		갈 수 있어
		네가 원한다면
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:09	Not if it's canceled, we can't.
		취소되면 못가지
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:11	Since when do you care about the rules?
		언제부터
		규칙을 지켰어?
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:17	You know, none of this would be an issue
		그 어느것도
		잘못되진 않았을거야
00:13:19	You know, none of this would be an issue
		 
00:13:19	if you'd have just done your job properly.
		네가 할일만
		제대로 했다면 말이야
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:22	I was perfectly willing to let you train Jeremy.
		제레미 훈련시키게
		해줬잖아
00:13:25	I was perfectly willing to let you train Jeremy.
		 
00:13:25	No, you weren't. Are you kidding?
		아니 그러지 않았어
		장난해?
00:13:27	No, you weren't. Are you kidding?
		 
00:13:27	You got there on day two.
		이튿날에 왔잖아
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:29	Do you know how hard it is to get
		얼마나 어려운줄 알아
00:13:30	Do you know how hard it is to get
		 
00:13:30	these x-box brains to focus?
		엑스박스하는 애를
		집중시키는게?
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:33	And then when I turned a room full of barflies
		그리고나서
		술집 죽돌이를
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	into vampires for him to slaughter,
		제레미가 죽이게
		뱀파이어로 만들었을때
00:13:37	into vampires for him to slaughter,
		 
00:13:37	you let Kol kill them.
		넌 콜이 죽이게
		내버려뒀지
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	Your brother problem, not mine, buddy.
		네 동생이 문제지
		난 아냐 친구야
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	And whose bright idea was it
		제레미가 죄책감에
		사로잡힌건
00:13:43	And whose bright idea was it
		 
00:13:43	to saddle Jeremy with a conscience, hmm?
		누구 덕분일까?
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	Well, we couldn't have him trying to stake Elena
		엘레나를 찌르게
		둘 순 없었잖아 안그래?
00:13:47	in her sleep, now, could we?
		엘레나를 찌르게
		둘 순 없었잖아 안그래?
00:13:48	in her sleep, now, could we?
		 
00:13:48	Ah, yes, for the love of Elena.
		아 그래
		엘레나를 사랑해서
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	How is it that she manages to overlook
		네가 저지른
		끔찍한 일들을
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	every horrific thing you've ever done?
		엘레나가 어떻게
		용서해주는거야?
00:13:55	every horrific thing you've ever done?
		 
00:13:55	Is it willful ignorance
		일부러 무시하나?
00:13:57	Is it willful ignorance
		 
00:13:57	or perhaps something more pathological?
		아니면 병적인거에
		더 가깝나?
00:13:59	or perhaps something more pathological?
		 
00:13:59	Some people are just more capable
		어떤 사람들은 용서를
		잘 해주거든
00:14:00	of forgiveness than others.
		어떤 사람들은 용서를
		잘 해주거든
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:02	Bet you score about a negative 500 in that realm.
		그 부분에서
		넌 -500점이야 장담한다
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	Come on. There must be a secret.
		얼른 분명
		비결이 있을거야
00:14:09	Come on. There must be a secret.
		 
00:14:09	It can't just be the sire bond. What is it?
		복종때문에 그럴순 없어
		대체 뭐야?
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	Compulsion?
		강요했어?
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:13	Manipulation?
		조정했어?
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:19	What did you say to her?
		뭐라고 했지?
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:30	I think this has something to do
		어떤 금발 뱀파이어랑
		관련있는것 같네
00:14:31	with a certain blond vampire.
		어떤 금발 뱀파이어랑
		관련있는것 같네
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:35	I think you murdered Carol Lockwood,
		캐롤 락우드
		죽일 생각인가본데
00:14:36	I think you murdered Carol Lockwood,
		 
00:14:36	and I think you're worried
		걱정되나보지
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:38	that Caroline's never going to forgive you.
		캐롤라인이 절대
		용서하지 않을까봐
00:14:40	 
		 
00:14:40	You've done worse.
		넌 더 심한짓도
		했잖아
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	Debatable. See, I don't mind being the bad guy,
		논란의 여지가 있지
		난 나쁜놈이 되도 상관없거든
00:14:45	 
		 
00:14:47	because somebody has to fill that role and get things done.
		누군가는 그 역할을 꿰차고
		마무리 지어야 하거든
00:14:49	because somebody has to fill that role and get things done.
		 
00:14:49	You do bad things for no reason.
		넌 아무 이유없이
		나쁜짓을 하려고 해
00:14:51	 
		 
00:14:52	You do them to be a dick.
		나쁜놈이 되려고
		그러는거지
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:54	Debatable.
		논란의 여지가
		있겠는데
00:14:55	 
		 
00:14:56	If you're gonna be bad, be bad with purpose.
		나쁜놈이 되려거든
		목적을 가지고 그렇게 해
00:14:58	 
		 
00:14:59	Otherwise you're just not worth forgiving.
		그렇지 않으면
		용서받을 가치도 없게 되
00:15:01	 
		 
00:15:15	Sorry, and dig up your people's alcohol.
		미안 너때는 뭐
		마셨는지 캐물어서
00:15:18	 
		 
00:15:20	Yeah, that's the problem with people today.
		그게 요즘
		사람들 문제야
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:22	They have no drinking imagination.
		뭘 좋아하는지
		상상력이 없어요
00:15:24	 
		 
00:15:24	Turn of the century New Orleans,
		시대가 바뀌고나서
		뉴올리언즈도
00:15:26	 
		 
00:15:26	now, they knew how to make a drink.
		이제는 술을
		잘 만들더라구
00:15:28	now, they knew how to make a drink.
		 
00:15:28	You lived in New Orleans?
		뉴올리언즈에 살았어?
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	We all did,
		우리 모두
		거기서 살았어
00:15:30	 
		 
00:15:31	till Niklaus shoved a dagger in my heart.
		니콜라우스가 날
		찌르기 전까진
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	Why? What did you do?
		왜?
		뭘 잘못했길래?
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	What makes you think I did anything?
		왜 내가 잘못했을거라
		생각해?
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	Has your alliance with my brother
		형이랑 연합했다고
00:15:40	softened you to his horrors?
		형이랑 연합했다고
00:15:40	softened you to his horrors?
		 
00:15:40	softened you to his horrors?
		형에 대한 공포심도
		사그라들었나봐?
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:42	I don't have an alliance with Klaus.
		클라우스랑 연합한게 아냐
00:15:44	 
		 
00:15:45	We had a mutual interest in finding the cure. That's all.
		서로가 치료제를 찾고
		싶은것 뿐이야 그게 다야
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	- Had? - Yes.
		-이젠 아니다?
		-그래
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:51	And I'm willing to give up looking for it
		기꺼이 찾는걸
		포기할 생각이야
00:15:53	 
		 
00:15:53	if you promise to leave my brother alone.
		동생만
		내버려 둔다면
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:58	Now can you teach me how to make this?
		이제 이거 만드는
		법좀 알켜줄래?
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:05	Ok, I'll get some ice.
		얼음 가저올게
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:15	 
		-말뚝 얘가 가지고 있어
		-보니 찾는중, 콜 붙잡아둬
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:27	Bonnie, where are you? I've called, like, 17 times.
		보니 어딨어?
		17번이나 걸었어
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:31	Kol is in our house. We need you.
		콜이 우리집에 있어
		네가 필요해
00:16:33	 
		 
00:16:35	Ok, I'm headed to your house now.
		좋아 지금
		너네집 간다
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:39	Here you go.
		여깄어
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	Would you like one?
		너도 마실래?
00:16:41	 
		 
00:16:43	Sure. Why not?
		그러지 뭐
00:16:44	 
		 
00:16:49	You are really good at that game.
		저 게임 잘하네
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:51	Especially considering you've been locked up in a coffin
		100년이나 관에
		갇혀있던걸 고려한다면
00:16:54	 
		100년이나 관에
		갇혀있던걸 고려한다면
00:16:54	for a hundred years.
		100년이나 관에
		갇혀있던걸 고려한다면
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	I'm a quick learner. Speedy reflexes.
		금방 배우거든
		반응속도도 빠르고
00:16:58	 
		 
00:16:59	It's not much like the real thing, though, is it?
		실제랑은 많이
		다르겠지만 그렇지?
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:02	You have killed, haven't you?
		너도 죽여봤지 그렇지?
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:04	Or are you one of those mary sue vampires?
		아니면 사람 못죽이는
		뱀파이어 중 하나인가?
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:10	I killed once.
		한번 죽여봤어
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:14	I'm guessing your number is a lot higher than mine.
		나보다는 네가
		많이 죽였을것 같네
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:17	You lose track over the years.
		오랫동안
		잊고 있었구나
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:20	So are we going to talk about Silas
		사일러스에 대해
		말하는거야?
00:17:22	So are we going to talk about Silas
		 
00:17:22	or just jibber jabber?
		아니면 쓸모없는
		말만 할거야?
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:32	 
		단검 못찾았어
		시간이 필요해
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:47	No one else seems to think Silas exists.
		아무도 사일러스가 존재한다고
		생각하지 않는것 같은데
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:50	So why do you?
		넌 왜 존재한다고
		생각해?
00:17:51	So why do you?
		 
00:17:51	I used to run with some witches
		마녀들과 자주
		어울렸었어
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:53	in Africa in the 14th century,
		14세기에는
		아프리카에서
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	Haiti in the 17th century,
		17세기에는
		아이티섬에서
00:17:57	 
		 
00:17:57	New Orleans in the 1900s.
		1900년대에는
		뉴올리언즈에서
00:17:59	 
		 
00:17:59	They all knew about Silas
		그들 모두가 사일러스를
		알고 있었어
00:18:01	 
		 
00:18:01	and that he needed to stay buried.
		사일러스가
		묻혀있어야 한다는것도
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:04	I actually hold witches in high esteem.
		난 실제로 마녀들을
		매우 존경하거든
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:06	Yeah, but why Silas?
		근데 왜 사일러스는?
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:08	Why are you so afraid of him?
		왜 그렇게 무서워해?
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:10	They said if Silas rises,
		사일러스가 깨어나면
00:18:12	They said if Silas rises,
		 
00:18:12	he'll unleash hell on earth.
		종말을
		불러올거라 했어
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:15	I happen to like earth just the way it is.
		난 지금 이대로인
		지구가 좋아
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:19	That's pretty Biblical.
		성서에나
		나올법한 얘긴데
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:21	Well, that's the other problem with people today.
		그게 요즘 사람들의
		또다른 문제야
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:23	They've lost faith,
		믿음을 잃었어
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:25	and in that loss, they no longer know who they should fear.
		그 와중에 누구를 두려워해야
		되는지 모르게 됬어
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:36	I have to get to Elena.
		엘레나한테
		가야되요
00:18:37	I have to get to Elena.
		 
00:18:37	Have you seen my phone?
		핸드폰 봤어요?
00:18:38	 
		 
00:18:38	I've got your phone, and I've got your car keys.
		핸드폰도 나한테 있고
		차열쇠도 나한테 있어
00:18:41	 
		 
00:18:41	And I told you we are having a family meeting.
		가족회의
		할거라고 했지
00:18:44	 
		 
00:18:44	Is that something you read in a book?
		책에서 그렇게 하래요?
00:18:46	Is that something you read in a book?
		 
00:18:46	Because we have never had a family meeting.
		우린 가족회의 한번도
		한적 없거든요
00:18:48	Because we have never had a family meeting.
		 
00:18:48	I've let this go on long enough.
		충분히 오랫동안
		두고봐왔어
00:18:49	 
		 
00:18:50	Shane said you and your magic are like a ticking time bomb.
		쉐인이 너랑 마법은
		시한폭탄 같다고 했어
00:18:53	Shane said you and your magic are like a ticking time bomb.
		 
00:18:53	And I told you he's crazy.
		쉐인교수님 미쳤다고
		말했잖아요
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:55	I lost your mother to witchcraft.
		마법때문에
		엄마를 잃었어
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:58	I don't intend to lose you.
		널 잃고 싶진 않아
00:18:59	 
		 
00:19:00	It's not your life. It's mine.
		아빠 인생이 아니라
		제 인생이잖아요
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:11	Hey, is Bonnie here?
		보니 여기있나요?
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	She's busy.
		바쁘단다
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:14	It's important.
		중요한거에요
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:16	What's going on?
		왜그래?
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:17	I've called you, like, a hundred times.
		백번이나 전화했었어
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	Kol is in our house.
		콜이 우리집에 있어
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	- I have to go. - I said no.
		-가봐야되요
		-안된다고 했지
00:19:22	 
		 
00:19:25	Stop telling me what to do!
		이래라 저래라
		하지마세요
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:31	No one's going anywhere!
		아무도 못나가
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:34	Mom?
		엄마?
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:36	Abby, please come in.
		애비 어서와
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:49	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐해요?
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	Your father called. Who's professor Shane?
		아빠가 전화했어
		쉐인 교수가 누구야?
00:19:53	 
		 
00:19:53	What has he been teaching you?
		뭘 가르치고 있었어?
00:19:54	What has he been teaching you?
		 
00:19:54	Bonnie, we don't have time for this.
		보니 이럴 시간 없어
00:19:56	Bonnie, we don't have time for this.
		 
00:19:56	This is a family matter.
		이건 가정문제야
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:57	My sister's in trouble. We need Bonnie's help.
		누나가 위험해요
		보니 도움이 필요해요
00:20:00	My sister's in trouble. We need Bonnie's help.
		 
00:20:00	My daughter is done helping Elena Gilbert.
		내 딸이 엘레나 길버트
		도와주는거 끝났어
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	- Now get out. - Mom!
		-이제 나가
		-엄마
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:05	Answer my question.
		대답해
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	What lies has this professor been telling you?
		이 교수가 그동안
		무슨 거짓말을 한거야?
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:11	Don't! Jeremy! Hey, stop!
		안돼 제레미
		야 그만해
00:20:13	Don't! Jeremy! Hey, stop!
		 
00:20:13	Stop.
		멈춰
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:16	Don't hurt her. She's my mom.
		다치게 하지마
		우리 엄마야
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:19	Look at me.
		나좀 봐
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:29	Just go, Okay?
		일단 가 알았지?
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:31	I'm right behind you.
		뒤따라 갈게
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:38	You wanna talk?
		애기하고 싶어요?
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:41	Let's talk.
		얘기해요
00:20:42	 
		 
00:20:48	 
		이건 괜찮은것 같은데
00:20:48	But I think this is a good year.
		이건 괜찮은것 같은데
00:20:51	 
		 
00:20:52	What if I said I don't believe you?
		널 믿지 않는다고
		한다면?
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:55	Ok, you got me. I don't know anything about wine.
		그래 알아챘구나
		와인은 하나도 몰라
00:20:58	 
		 
00:21:01	Just seems odd that you being so willing
		간절히 원했던걸
		쉽게 포기하는게 이상해서
00:21:03	to give up something you want so much.
		간절히 원했던걸
		쉽게 포기하는게 이상해서
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:07	I would do anything for my brother.
		내 동생을 위해서라면
		무슨짓이든 할거야
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:10	And if what you're saying about Silas is true.
		사일러스에 관한게
		사실이라해도
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	What does it matter what I want
		내가 원하는게
		무슨 상관이겠어
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	if it puts everyone else in danger?
		다른 사람들을
		위험하게 한다는데?
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:19	Well, this has been a lightning.
		음 이게 더 와닿네
00:21:22	 
		 
00:21:23	Thanks for the drinks.
		술은 고마웠어
00:21:24	 
		 
00:21:31	I'll take your request for truth under advisement.
		믿고 심사숙고
		해볼게
00:21:34	 
		 
00:21:35	Is there any chance that you can be wrong about silas?
		사일러스에 대해 네가
		틀릴 가능성은 없는거야?
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:41	Trust me, Elena.
		날 믿어 엘레나
00:21:42	 
		 
00:21:43	Some things are better left buried.
		묻어진채로 있는게
		나은것도 있어
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:54	Think I saw a horro movie that started just like this.
		이렇게 시작하는
		호러무비를 본적 있어
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:59	Did you know they play movies on tv all night long now?
		밤새도록 티비에서
		영화하는거 알아?
00:22:01	Did you know they play movies on tv all night long now?
		 
00:22:01	Hundreds of them.
		수백개나 되
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:03	So much better than those silly
		우리가 봤던 유치한
		흑백영화보다 훨씬 낫지
00:22:05	Black-and-white picture shows we use to go to.
		우리가 봤던 유치한
		흑백영화보다 훨씬 낫지
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:10	I don't know.
		글쎄
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	Kind of miss the old ones.
		옛날이 그립던데
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:14	You got any requests for the DJ?
		디제이한테 요청하고
		싶은거 없어요?
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	 
		아직도 찾는중
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	I'll let you pick. Nothing cheesy.
		네가 골라봐
		느끼한거 빼고
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:20	Oh, that leaves out about half the decade.
		5년이나 됬는데
		아직도 싫어하네
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:26	- Hope you like the cure. - Funny.
		-The Cure는 좋아하길 바래
		-재밌네
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:30	So is everything about the eighties so...
		80년대는 전부
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:33	excessive?
		오버했던가?
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	It had its charm.
		나름대로
		매력이 있었지
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	"Say anything"--
		"Say anything"
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:39	Lloyd Dobler standing outside of a bedroom window
		Lloyd Dobler가
		창문 너머로
00:22:41	Lloyd Dobler standing outside of a bedroom window
		 
00:22:41	with a boombox over his head
		라디오를 들고
		서있었어
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:43	desperately trying to get back the girl of his dreams.
		꿈에 그리던 여자를
		얻으려고
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:46	"Princess bride"--
		"Princess bride"

		반성의 시간 한번으로
		문제아들이 협력을 하지
00:22:54	 
		 
00:22:56	So it was a decade of sentimental drivel, as well.
		쓸데없이 감정적인
		10년이었네
00:22:59	 
		 
00:22:59	Well, I was gonna say love, friendship,
		이렇게 말하려고 했는데
		사랑 우정
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:04	Possibility of anything happening.
		가능성
00:23:05	 
		 
00:23:07	You would've loved it.
		너도 좋아했을거야
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:09	And why is that?
		왜 그렇게 생각해?
00:23:10	And why is that?
		 
00:23:10	Because, as much as we both hate to admit it,
		우리 둘다 인정하기
		싫은만큼
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:14	we care about those things.
		그런것들을
		소중히 여기니까
00:23:16	 
		 
00:23:24	That better not be a corsage.
		그거 코르사지는 아니지
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:26	I loathe corsages.
		코르사지 혐오해
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:28	These were all the rage in the eighties.
		80년대에는

00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:45	Let's dance.
		춤추자
00:23:46	 
		 
00:24:16	I'm sorry. He left.
		미안해
		콜 갔어
00:24:18	I'm sorry. He left.
		 
00:24:18	I mean, I tried to stall as long as I could.
		가능한
		잡아두려 했는데
00:24:20	 
		 
00:24:23	That's Bonnie. She was right behind me.
		보니일거야
		뒤따로 온다고 했거든
00:24:25	 
		 
00:24:29	I've considered your request for truce.
		휴전하자는 요청
		곰곰히 생각해봤어
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:34	Request denied.
		요청은 거부되었어
00:24:35	 
		 
00:24:36	I'm sorry. I've already been invited in.
		미안한데 이미
		초대했잖아
00:24:38	 
		 
00:24:43	Hide and seek?
		숨바꼭질?
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:45	Fine by me.
		난 괜찮아
00:24:46	 
		 
00:24:48	Dad needs to mind his own business,
		아빠는 자기일에
		신경써야해요
00:24:50	Dad needs to mind his own business,
		 
00:24:50	he had no right to call you here.
		엄마를 여기로
		부를 권리는 없어요
00:24:51	he had no right to call you here.
		 
00:24:51	It's not just your father, Bonnie.
		아빠 때문이 아니야
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:53	Witches talk. Word gets around.
		마녀들
		소문이 파다해
00:24:55	Witches talk. Word gets around.
		 
00:24:55	I found a new way to practice.
		새로운 방법으로
		마법을 하는거에요
00:24:57	I found a new way to practice.
		 
00:24:57	It's unconventional, but I can handle myself, I promise.
		색다르긴 하지만
		조절할수 있어요 약속해요
00:25:00	It's unconventional, but I can handle myself, I promise.
		 
00:25:00	That's not what Shane said.
		쉐인은 그렇게
		말하지 않았어
00:25:02	That's not what Shane said.
		 
00:25:02	Shane is sitting in a jail cell right now.
		쉐인교수님은 지금
		감옥에 있어요
00:25:03	 
		 
00:25:03	You're gonna take his word over mine?
		나보다 그사람
		말을 듣는거에요?
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	I've warned you about dark magic before.
		전에도 사악한
		마법을 경고했었잖아
00:25:07	I've warned you about dark magic before.
		 
00:25:07	It's not dark magic. It's expression, and I need it.
		사악한 마법이 아니라
		익스프레션이고 꼭 필요해요
00:25:11	 
		 
00:25:13	They found a cure, Mom.
		치료제를
		찾았어요 엄마
00:25:15	 
		 
00:25:16	There's a cure for vampirism,
		뱀파이어를
		치료할 수 있어요
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	and I can do the spell to access it.
		거기에 접근할 수 있는
		주문을 제가 할 수 있구요
00:25:21	 
		 
00:25:21	I can save you, but I have to go...
		엄마를 구할 수 있어요
		일단 가야되요
00:25:25	 
		 
00:25:26	Now.
		지금이요
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:28	I'm not the one that needs to be saved.
		구원받아야 되는건
		내가 아니야
00:25:30	 
		 
00:25:32	You are.
		바로 너지
00:25:33	 
		 
00:25:43	Your brother's lack of communication is infuriating.
		네 동생 연락안되는건
		정말 짜증난다
00:25:46	 
		 
00:25:47	It's one of his trademarks,
		특징 중 하나야
00:25:48	 
		 
00:25:49	like his brooding and his hair.
		심술이나
		머리처럼
00:25:50	 
		 
00:25:51	I don't understand what's taking so long.
		왜 이리 오래걸리는지
		모르겠네
00:25:52	 
		 
00:25:52	I mean, how hard is it to steal a dagger?
		단검 훔치는게
		뭐 어렵다고?
00:25:54	I mean, how hard is it to steal a dagger?
		 
00:25:54	From the vampire who's been stabbed by it as many times as your sister,
		여러번 단검에 찔린
		네 여동생한테는
00:25:57	From the vampire who's been stabbed by it as many times as your sister,
		 
00:25:57	I'd say difficult.
		힘들것 같은데
00:25:59	 
		 
00:26:04	Sweet.
		고마워라
00:26:06	 
		 
00:26:08	You disappoint me, Damon.
		날 실망시켰어
		데이먼
00:26:10	 
		 
00:26:11	You're not trying very hard to get out of here.
		여길 나가려고
		애쓰지 않네
00:26:13	You're not trying very hard to get out of here.
		 
00:26:13	I expected more the daring escape artist,
		대담한 탈출
		묘기를 기대했는데
00:26:15	 
		 
00:26:15	less the cell potato.
		침대에 앉아
		있는게 아니라
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	Well, I am compelled to kill Jeremy,
		제레미를 죽이라고
		주술에 걸렸는데
00:26:18	Well, I am compelled to kill Jeremy,
		 
00:26:18	so I figured it's probably smarter
		여기 앉아서 너랑
		잡담이나 하는게
00:26:19	so I figured it's probably smarter
		 
00:26:20	to sit in there and chitchat with you
		현명하다고
		깨달았거든
00:26:21	to sit in there and chitchat with you
		 
00:26:22	than try to bust out of here like the Hulk.
		헐크처럼 여길 부수는것
		보다는 말이야
00:26:23	 
		 
00:26:24	How do you think Elena felt about that, by the way,
		그런데 죽어야 되는게
		엘레나가 가장 사랑하는
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:27	Your inability to overcome Kol's compulsion for a single moment,
		사람이었는데도
		콜의 주술을 단 한번도
00:26:30	Your inability to overcome Kol's compulsion for a single moment,
		 
00:26:30	even though it meant killing the person
		극복하지
		못한거에 대해
00:26:32	even though it meant killing the person
		 
00:26:32	she loves the most in the world?
		엘레나는 어떻게
		생각할것 같아?
00:26:33	 
		 
00:26:34	She's met me.
		날 만났거든
00:26:35	 
		 
00:26:35	She knows impulse control is not my strong suit.
		충동 억제하지 못하는거
		엘레나도 잘 알아
00:26:38	She knows impulse control is not my strong suit.
		 
00:26:38	Still, must be hard
		그렇다해도
		분명 힘들거야
00:26:41	Still, must be hard
		 
00:26:41	trying to live up to Stefan.
		스테판한테도 맞춰
		살려고 노력하는건
00:26:42	 
		스테판한테도 맞춰
		살려고 노력하는건
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:44	I remember when I compelled him to feed on Elena,
		엘레나 피를 마시라고
		주술을 걸은게 기억나
00:26:47	 
		 
00:26:48	he fought so hard, he actually managed to resist.
		열심히 싸워서
		간신히 저항했어
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:52	Now, that's love.
		그게 사랑이지
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	What do you know about love?
		사랑에 대해
		네가 뭘 알아?
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:56	I know that you're in love with Elena,
		네가 엘레나를
		사랑하는건 알지
00:26:58	 
		 
00:26:59	but I think you're afraid of what might happen
		치료제를 찾으면
00:27:01	but I think you're afraid of what might happen
		 
00:27:01	when we find the cure at the end of the rainbow.
		넌 무슨일이 생길지
		두려워하는것 같아
00:27:03	 
		 
00:27:03	Personally, I don't see a fairy-tale ending for you?
		너한테 동화같은
		해피엔딩은 없는것 같은데?
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:08	All I see is Stefan and Elena.
		나한테 보이는건
		스테판과 엘레나 뿐이야
00:27:11	 
		 
00:27:14	I think you see the same thing.
		너도 그렇게
		생각하잖아
00:27:16	 
		 
00:27:23	Well, if it isn't the happy homicidal maniac.
		행복한 살인광 아닌가
00:27:26	 
		 
00:27:26	Do you know that your darling former blood bag
		형이 전에
		피빨아먹던 여자랑
00:27:28	Do you know that your darling former blood bag
		 
00:27:28	and her brother are trying to kill me?
		그녀 동생이 날
		죽이려 하는거 알아?
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	What?
		뭐?
00:27:31	What?
		 
00:27:31	Don't pretend like you're not in on it.
		모르는척 하지마
00:27:32	Don't pretend like you're not in on it.
		 
00:27:32	Your obsession to find the cure
		치료제를 찾으려는
		집착이
00:27:34	Your obsession to find the cure
		 
00:27:34	clearly trumps any sibling loyalty you once felt.
		한때 형이 느꼈던
		가족애를 짓밟았어
00:27:36	 
		 
00:27:37	I don't know what you're talking about.
		무슨 소린지 몰라
00:27:38	I don't know what you're talking about.
		 
00:27:38	I'm going to rip off Jeremy's arm
		제레미 팔 뜯어내고
00:27:40	I'm going to rip off Jeremy's arm
		 
00:27:40	and kill Elena just for sport.
		재미로 엘레나를
		죽일거야
00:27:42	 
		 
00:27:43	Then I'm coming for you.
		그리고
		형한테 갈거야
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:57	What the hell is going on?
		대체 무슨 짓이야?
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:59	I don't know.
		몰라
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	What are Stefan and Elena planning?
		스테판이랑 엘레나가
		꾸미는게 뭐야?
00:28:02	What are Stefan and Elena planning?
		 
00:28:02	I don't know.
		몰라
00:28:03	I don't know.
		 
00:28:03	I've been stuck in the penalty box with you since yesterday.
		페널티박스에 너랑
		갇혀있던게 어제부터야
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:06	Stefan won't talk to me,
		스테판은 말도 안했고
00:28:07	Stefan won't talk to me,
		 
00:28:07	And Elena won't come to see me.
		엘레나는 보러
		오지도 않았어
00:28:08	And Elena won't come to see me.
		 
00:28:08	So maybe you're right. Maybe she's written me off.
		네 말이 맞을지도 몰라
		날 하찮게 생각할지도 몰라
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:14	Tell me what you know.
		네가 아는걸 말해
00:28:16	 
		 
00:28:17	I don't know anything about a plan.
		계획에 대해선
		아무것도 몰라
00:28:19	 
		 
00:28:22	You stay here till I return.
		돌아올때까지
		여기 가만히 있어
00:28:24	 
		 
00:28:29	I will stay here until you return...
		너 올때까지
		여기 있을게
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:35	or not.
		아닐수도 있지
00:28:37	 
		 
00:28:51	It's amazing which you can find stashed away in the teachers' lounge.
		교사 휴게실에 숨겨논걸
		찾는건 대단해
00:28:55	 
		 
00:28:55	This song is not as terrible as the other ones.
		이 노래는 다른거처럼
		끔찍하진 않네
00:28:58	 
		 
00:28:58	This song is the Godfather of rock anthems, ok?
		이 노래가 대부의
		롹 축가야 알았어?
00:29:02	 
		 
00:29:02	What's going on with you?
		무슨 일이야?
00:29:03	What's going on with you?
		 
00:29:03	You're... fun tonight.
		오늘 재밌네
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:07	I can't listen to this music
		내 친구 렉시를
		생각하지 않고선
00:29:08	without thinking of my best friend Lexi.
		내 친구 렉시를
		생각하지 않고선
00:29:08	without thinking of my best friend Lexi.
		 
00:29:08	without thinking of my best friend Lexi.
		이 음악을
		들을 수가 없어
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:11	We spent most of the eighties together.
		80년대 대부분을
		함께 보냈어
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	I remember this one time she snuck us backstage
		한번은 백스테이지로
		몰래 들어가서
00:29:16	I remember this one time she snuck us backstage
		 
00:29:16	and compelled half the band to do tequila shots
		밴드한테 테킬라를
		마시게 주술을 걸었어
00:29:18	and compelled half the band to do tequila shots
		 
00:29:18	with us before the show.
		쇼시작하기 전에
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:19	She was fearless, kind of like you.
		용감했었지
		너처럼
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:23	So you slept with her, too?
		그래서
		렉시랑도 잤어?
00:29:25	 
		 
00:29:26	No. It wasn't like that.
		아니
		그렇진 않았어
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:29	I was just a better person when I was with her.
		렉시와 있으면
		난 더 나은 사람이었어
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:32	I didn't think I'd ever feel that way again.
		다시는 그런 기분을
		느끼진 못할것 같아
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:35	Until Elena.
		엘레나를 만나기 전까진
00:29:37	 
		 
00:29:39	Until Elena.
		엘레나를 만나기 전까진
00:29:40	 
		 
00:29:42	And now that's over.
		이제는 그것도
		끝났어
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:47	That look right there,
		방금 그 표정
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:49	that is why I don't let myself care.
		내가 소중히 여기지 않는게
		바로 그거 때문이야
00:29:51	 
		 
00:29:53	Well, you can say that,
		그렇긴 해
00:29:54	 
		 
00:29:54	But we both know it's not true.
		하지만 사실이
		아니란거 둘다 알잖아
00:29:57	 
		 
00:30:03	Don't worry.
		걱정하지마
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:05	I'll protect you if Kol tracks his way
		콜이 버려진 무도장까지
		쫓아오면 보호해줄게
00:30:06	to this abandoned dance.
		콜이 버려진 무도장까지
		쫓아오면 보호해줄게
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:18	I think I'll choose next song.
		다음 곡은
		내가 고를게
00:30:20	 
		 
00:30:20	No. You know what? I've a better idea.
		그러지말고
		더 좋은 생각이 있어
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:25	That way.
		저쪽으로
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:31	 
		단검은 레베카한테
		있어 이리와
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	Will you coming?
		올거야?
00:30:35	 
		 
00:31:01	Missed.
		빗나갔네
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:05	Go!
		어서 가
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:35	Now, About that arm.
		이제 팔 말인데
00:31:39	 
		 
00:32:01	 
		이렇게
00:32:01	Like that!
		이렇게
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:04	This is ridiculous.
		우스꽝스러워
00:32:05	This is ridiculous.
		 
00:32:05	Well, that's the whole point of the "Breakfast club" slide.
		미끄러지는게
		Breakfast club의 포인트야
00:32:08	Well, that's the whole point of the "Breakfast club" slide.
		 
00:32:08	It's supposed to be ridiculous.
		우스꽝스러워야되
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:11	No. That's--
		아니 그건
		그건 반칙이야
00:32:13	 
		아니 그건
		그건 반칙이야
00:32:14	That's cheating.
		아니 그건
		그건 반칙이야
00:32:14	That's cheating.
		 
00:32:14	What is fun about hurtling down a hallway
		얼간이처럼 복도를
		뛰어가는게 무슨 재미야?
00:32:16	like a teenage imbecile?
		얼간이처럼 복도를
		뛰어가는게 무슨 재미야?
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	You're just gonna have to do it to find out.
		해보면 알아
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:31	All right. It's the shoes.
		신발때문인가봐
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	Take off your shoes, you'll be fine, ok?
		신발 벗으면
		괜찮을거야 알았어?
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:52	This is what you want right?
		이게 네가
		원하는거지?
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:58	Go ahead.
		가져가
00:32:59	 
		 
00:32:59	Take care.
		조심해
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:06	You're right, I do care.
		네 말이 맞아
		나 소중히 생각해
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	I want stupid koala corsages
		바보같은 코알라
		코르사지도 하고 싶고
00:33:10	I want stupid koala corsages
		 
00:33:10	and a prom.
		프롬도 그렇고
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:12	I want to have kids with someone
		창밖에서 라디오를
00:33:15	I want to have kids with someone
		 
00:33:15	who loves me enough to stand
		들고 서있을정도로
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	outside my window with a stupid boombox.
		날 사랑하는 사람과
		애기도 갖고 싶어
00:33:18	 
		 
00:33:20	 
		사람이 되고 싶어
00:33:20	I want to be human.
		사람이 되고 싶어
00:33:21	 
		사람이 되고 싶어
00:33:22	 
		 
00:33:28	So let Klaus put down my brother.
		그러니 클라우스보고
		콜 붙잡으라고 해
00:33:30	 
		그러니 클라우스보고
		콜 붙잡으라고 해
00:33:30	 
		 
00:33:30	 
		치료제 찾으러 가자
00:33:30	Let's go find the cure.
		치료제 찾으러 가자
00:33:32	 
		치료제 찾으러 가자
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:44	 
		어서 가자
00:33:44	Come on, let's go.
		어서 가자
00:33:45	 
		어서 가자
00:33:46	 
		 
00:34:02	You dragged her?
		약먹인거야?
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:05	Just enough to keep her down
		붙잡아 둘만큼만
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:07	until I can get some witches here
		마법을 만들때까지
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	to clean her mind from that poison
		교수가 가르친
		사악함을
00:34:10	to clean her mind from that poison
		 
00:34:10	that professor has been teaching her.
		정화시키려고
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:13	That's not happening.
		그런일은 없어요
00:34:14	 
		 
00:34:15	Bonnie, please.
		보니 제발
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:23	I don't belong to the spirits anymore.
		더이상 영혼에
		얽매이지 않아요
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:27	I belong to myself. Sorry.
		나 자신만
		있음되요 죄송해요
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:47	Now, like I said, I don't fancy the hunter's curse.
		전에도 말했지만
		헌터의 저주는 싫어
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:50	So I'm just gonna chop off your arm, but don't worry.

		걱정하지마
00:34:53	 
		 
00:34:53	I'll heal you right up with a bit of blood after.
		곧바로 내 피로

00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:59	Now, which arm is it? Is it left or right?
		어느 팔이야?
		왼쪽 아니면 오른쪽?
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:03	I'll just chop off both to be safe.
		확실하게 둘다
		잘라야지
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:25	Jeremy! Now!
		제레미 지금이야
00:35:27	 
		 
00:36:09	What did you do?
		뭘 한거야?
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:11	We didn't have a choice.
		선택의 여지가
		없었어요
00:36:12	 
		 
00:36:13	He was trying to cut off Jeremy's arm.
		제레미 팔을
		자르려고 했다구요

00:36:15	Lies.
		거짓말
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	He never would've gotten
		너희들이 덫을
		논게 아니었으면
00:36:17	He never would've gotten
		 
00:36:17	inside if you hadn't have set a trap for him.
		콜은 들어가지도

00:36:19	You said you were gonna put him down, too.
		당신도 쓰러뜨릴거라고
		했잖아요
00:36:21	You said you were gonna put him down, too.
		 
00:36:21	I was gonna make him suffer on my terms!
		내 방식대로 고생하게
		만들려고 했었어
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:28	I want to burn this house to the ground,
		이 집
		불태울거야
00:36:30	 
		 
00:36:31	and then when you try to flee for our lives,
		살려고 도망가면
00:36:34	 
		 
00:36:34	I'll kill you both without blinking.
		눈하나 깜빡하지
		않고 둘다 죽일거야
00:36:35	I'll kill you both without blinking.
		 
00:36:35	You kill us, you'll never get to the cure.
		우리를 죽이면 치료제는
		얻지 못할텐데요
00:36:37	You kill us, you'll never get to the cure.
		 
00:36:37	You'll never be able to make any more hybrids.
		하이브리드는 하나도
		만들 수 없을거에요
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	You really think I care for an instant about my bloody hybrids?
		내가 망할놈의 하이브리드
		걱정이나 한다고 생각해?
00:36:44	 
		 
00:36:44	I want the cure so I can destroy it.
		부숴버릴 수 있으니까
		치료제를 원한거야
00:36:46	I want the cure so I can destroy it.

		파내는 즉시 너희
		모두 죽이려고 했어
00:36:48	I would've killed you all the second we dug it up,
		 
00:36:48	but now I'm just gonna watch you burn instead.
		근데 이제는 대신에
		타죽는걸 지켜볼거야
00:36:50	 
		 
00:36:55	Invite him in.
		초대해
00:36:57	 
		 
00:36:57	Do it.
		어서
00:36:58	 
		 
00:37:05	Come in.
		들어와요
00:37:06	 
		 
00:37:09	Living room. Go.
		거실로 가
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:28	Witch, you can't do this to me.
		마녀 나한테
		이렇게 못할텐데
00:37:31	Witch, you can't do this to me.
		 
00:37:31	You have no idea what I can do now.
		내가 지금 뭘 할 수
		있는지 모르잖아요
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:34	I will hunt all of you to your end!
		너희 모두 찾아서
		끝장낼거야
00:37:38	 
		 
00:37:39	Do you hear me? Do you?
		내 말 들었어?
		들었어?
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:50	I don't believe you.
		네 말 안믿어
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:53	Kol is not dead. He can't be.
		콜은 죽지 않았어
		그럴 수 없어

00:37:55	Listen, Rebekah. They didn't have a choice.
		들어봐 레베카
		선택의 여지가 없었어
00:37:57	Listen, Rebekah. They didn't have a choice.
		 
00:37:57	Kol started this when he went after Jeremy.
		제레미를 뒤쫓은건
		콜이 시작한거야
00:37:59	 
		 
00:37:59	He went after you, too. Do you remember?
		너도 뒤쫓았잖아
		기억해?
00:38:01	 
		 
00:38:01	I mean, he was never gonna let us find the cure.
		절대 우리가 치료제를
		찾지 못하게 했을거야
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:04	So you knew.
		그니까 너도
		알았구나
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	This whole night, you knew.
		오늘 밤내내

00:38:07	I'm not gonna let the people that I care about get hurt.
		내가 아끼는 사람들을
		다치게 하진 않을거야
00:38:09	 
		 
00:38:10	Not Jeremy, not Elena, not even Damon.
		제레미나 엘레나도 안되
		데이먼도 안되고
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:13	And you can hate me for it.
		그것때문에
		날 미워해도 되
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:14	Now he can't hurt you, either.
		이젠 콜이 너도
		다치게 하진 못해
00:38:16	 
		 
00:38:18	And I want us to find this cure together,
		우리가 함께 치료제를
		찾았으면 좋겠어
00:38:19	And I want us to find this cure together,
		 
00:38:19	you and me.
		너랑 나
00:38:20	 
		 
00:38:21	Not just for Elena, but for you.
		엘레나 뿐만 아니라
		널 위해서도
00:38:23	 
		 
00:38:24	So you can have what you want.
		너가 원하는걸
		갖을 수 있잖아
00:38:26	So you can have what you want.
		 
00:38:26	You can be who you want.

		될 수 있어
00:38:27	You can be who you want.
		 
00:38:27	You can be human again.
		다시 사람이
		될 수 있어
00:38:29	 
		 
00:38:34	Everyone deserves a second chance right?
		누구나 두번째 기회를
		갖을 자격이 있어 그렇지?
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:38	Why would I trust you?
		왜 내가 널 믿을것같아?
00:38:40	 
		 
00:38:43	I don't know.
		몰라
00:38:44	 
		 
00:38:45	I guess I could give you my word,
		약속 정도는
		할 수 있을것 같아서
00:38:48	 
		 
00:38:50	but at the end of the day you'll just have to take a leap.
		하지만 가장 중요한 것은
		네가 도약해야만 하는거겠지
00:38:52	 
		 
00:39:02	 
		효과가 없어
00:39:03	Didn't work.

		핀의 계통들이
		죽는데도 시간이 걸렸어
00:39:06	It took time for Finn's line to die off.

		기억나?
		효과 나타날거야
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:09	What if it doesn't?
		효과가 없다면?
00:39:10	What if it doesn't?
		 
00:39:10	Where's that Gilbert optimism?
		길버트가의 낙관적인
		태도는 어디간거야?
00:39:12	 
		 
00:39:25	Sorry I missed all the excitment.
		재미난 일
		놓쳐서 미안해
00:39:27

		보게 되서
		기뻐요
00:39:29

00:39:56	I drawn the new moon to bond the spell.
		초승달에 주문을
		걸었어
00:39:59	 
		 
00:40:00	Got three days to find that cure, four max.
		치료제 찾을 수 있는건
		3일정도야 길게 잡아 4일
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:03	If we don't, we might as well look up Katherine's appearance
		찾지 못하면 캐서린의 행방을
		찾아야 할지도 몰라
00:40:05	If we don't, we might as well look up Katherine's appearance
		 
00:40:05	and see if she wants some company in hiding,
		우리도 숨겨줄지
		알아봐야해
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:07	'cuz he will come after us.
		우리 뒤를
		쫓을테니까

		필요한건 다
		얻게 되는거야
00:40:16	we'll get everything we need.
		 
00:40:16	Yeah, I didn't uh...I didn't dagger her.
		나 단검
		꽂지 않았어
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:19	What? Why not?

		왜 안꼽았어?
00:40:22	 
		 
00:40:22	I didn't need to, she's on our side.

00:40:26	Did you really just say that?
		방금 정말로
		그렇게 말한거야?
00:40:28	Did you really just say that?
		 
00:40:28	Yeah. She handed over the headstone,
		응 묘비도
		건네줬어
00:40:29	Yeah. She handed over the headstone,
		 
00:40:29	I mean she wants to find this cure more than anyone of us.
		우리들 중 누구보다
		치료제를 찾고 싶어해
00:40:32	 
		 
00:40:33	Why would you possibly think that you could trust her?
		왜 레베카를 믿을 수
		있다고 생각한거야?
00:40:36	 
		 
00:40:36	 
		내가 맞춰볼게 레베카가
		너한테 충성을 약속했겠지
00:40:36	Let me guess. She pledged her allegiance

		너희 둘이 벌거벗고
		자는동안에
00:40:40	 
		 
00:40:49	I bet you're just dying to get that out, aren't you Damon?
		그말 하고 싶어 죽고
		싶었을거야 그렇지 않아?
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:52	Oh was this supposed to be secret?
		아 그거 비밀로
		해야 했던거야?
00:40:54	Oh was this supposed to be secret?
		 
00:40:54	Maybe you should make that a little clearer
		정리정돈을
		깔끔히 했어야지
00:40:55	Maybe you should make that a little clearer
		 
00:40:55	while you're bleeding me dry in our cellar.
		지하저장고에 나 피흘리게
		놔둔 것도 그렇고
00:40:57	 
		 
00:40:57	That is keeping you from killing Jeremy.
		그건 제레미를 죽이지
		못하게 하려고 한거야
00:40:59	That is keeping you from killing Jeremy.
		 
00:40:59	Stop it, both of you.
		둘다 그만해요
00:41:01	 
		 
00:41:01	Now why don't you tell her to calm down, Damon?
		엘레나한테 진정하라고
		말 좀 해주지 데이먼?
00:41:03	 
		 
00:41:04	You've managed she is all sire bond pretty well so far, haven't you?
		여태까지 종속관계를
		잘 사용해왔자나 안그래?
00:41:07	 
		 
00:41:23	It's happening.
		생기고 있어

00:41:26	My God.

00:41:29	What? You can see it?
		왜?
		너희들도 보여?
00:41:30	 
		 
00:41:45	Here we go.
		시작이구나
00:41:46
