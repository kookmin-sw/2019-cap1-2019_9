00:11:29	 
		 
00:11:30	I walked all the

		주차장도 두 번 돌고,
00:11:31	I walked all the
		parking areas twice,
		 
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	checked every medical tent.
		구호텐트도 전부 확인하고 나서
00:11:32	checked every medical tent.
		 
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	By the time I got back to my car,

		다행히 콘서트 티셔츠는 받았구나
00:11:43	looks like someone

00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:45	Dad, is there
		anything bothering you
		아빠, 혹시 요즘 심리학적으로 심하게
00:11:46	Dad, is there

		I don't know --
		 
00:11:48	 
		 
00:11:48	major psychological stress?
		뭔가가 있어요?
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	No. I've been acting
		normally, haven't I?
		아니, 아빠 완전 멀쩡하지 않니?
00:11:52	No. I've been acting
		normally, haven't I?
		 
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	Did something happen earlier today?
		오늘 오전에 무슨 일 있었어요?
00:11:54	Did something happen earlier today?
		 
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	Uh, nothing at all.
		아니, 전혀
00:11:55	Uh, nothing at all.
		 
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:56	Because you seem
		a little tense.
		아빠 좀 긴장한거 같아서요
00:11:57	 
		 
00:11:57	What? No, I don't!
		Stop badgering me!
		뭐? 아니거든! 
		그만 캐물어라!
00:11:58	What? No, I don't!
		Stop badgering me!
		 
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	I love your mom!
		Let's listen to some music.
		난 네 엄마를 사랑해!
		음악이나 듣자
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:01	Boy, the way you cook things up
		sometimes, it's a little --
		알렉스, 네가 그렇게 
		늘어놓는 얘기들은 가끔씩 약간--
00:12:03	Boy, the way you cook things up
		sometimes, it's a little --
		 
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	- Dad!
		- What?!
		- 아빠!
		- 왜?!
00:12:04	- Dad!
		- What?!
		 
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	You fell asleep!
		아빠 잠들었어요!
00:12:05	You fell asleep!
		 
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	It's like the fifth time today.
		오늘 한 다섯 번 그랬다구요
00:12:07	It's like the fifth time today.
		 
00:12:07	 
		 
00:12:07	I think it has something
		to do with that guy
		제 생각엔 이게 오늘 그 수리공이
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	not showing up to fix
		the washing machine.
		안 온 거랑 관련된 것 같아요
00:12:09	not showing up to fix
		the washing machine.
		 
00:12:09	 
		 
00:12:09	Well, that's not exactly
		what happened.
		꼭 안왔다고는 할 수 없다
00:12:11	Well, that's not exactly
		what happened.
		 
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	You snuck out to buy
		아빠가 그 음반가게에
00:12:12	You snuck out to buy
		 
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	"Nobody Does It Better"
		from Flipside Records,
		"누구도 더 잘할 수 없어"
		몰래 사러 나갔고
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:14	and he showed up?
		그 수리공이 왔었다구요?
00:12:15	and he showed up?
		 
00:12:15	 
		 
00:12:15	That's more exactly
		what happened.
		그래 그게 더 정확한 사실이지
00:12:16	That's more exactly
		what happened.
		 
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	How do you know all this?
		어떻게 다 알았니?
00:12:17	How do you know all this?
		 
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	I've been watching you all day.
		오늘 계속 아빠를 지켜봤어요
00:12:19	I've been watching you all day.
		 
00:12:19	 
		 
00:12:19	I think the guilt from that has been
		causing you to fall asleep.
		제 생각엔 그 죄책감이
		아빠를 잠들게 하는 것 같아요
00:12:21	I think the guilt from that has been
		causing you to fall asleep.
		 
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:21	So you know about Carla?
		그럼 너 칼라를 아는거니?
00:12:23	So you know about Carla?
		 
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	I do now.
		이제는 알죠
00:12:24	I do now.
		 
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:25	- Dad!
		- What is happening?!
		- 아빠!
		- 뭔일이야!!
00:12:27	- Dad!
		- What is happening?!
		 
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:28	I was skeptical about the jeans
		and t-shirt, but I like it.
		청바지랑 티셔츠는 좀 별로였는데 
		입어보니 좋네요
00:12:31	I was skeptical about the jeans
		and t-shirt, but I like it.
		 
00:12:31	 
		 
00:12:31	Any chance the photographer
		could fire off a couple solo shots?
		혹시 그 사진사가
		제 독사진도 몇 장 찍어줄까요?
00:12:34	Any chance the photographer
		could fire off a couple solo shots?
		 
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	Look at the bottom of Joe's face.
		조 하관이 왜 이러니!
00:12:36	Look at the bottom of Joe's face.
		 
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	What happened?
		Did you leave him in the sun?
		무슨 일이에요?
		햇볕에 그냥 놔뒀어요?
00:12:38	What happened?
		Did you leave him in the sun?
		 
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	No, I took him out
		for five minutes
		아니, 한 오분정도
		데리고 나갔었어
00:12:40	No, I took him out
		for five minutes
		 
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	to give him a little color.
		너무 하얀거 같아서 말야
00:12:41	to give him a little color.
		 
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:42	I must have not closed
		the visor all the way down.
		유모차 뚜껑을
		다 닫을 걸 그랬나봐
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	Why is it so important
		to you that he has color?
		조 얼굴이 하얀게
		그렇게 중요해요?
00:12:47	Why is it so important
		to you that he has color?
		 
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:47	Because we're sending
		this picture
		왜냐하면 사진 찍어서
00:12:48	Because we're sending
		this picture
		 
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:48	to our family in Colombia,
		콜롬비아에 우리 가족에게 보내게 될텐데
00:12:49	to our family in Colombia,
		 
00:12:49	 
		 
00:12:49	and I have a son that
		doesn't even look Colombian.
		조는 전혀 콜롬비아 사람처럼 안생겼잖니
00:12:52	and I have a son that
		doesn't even look Colombian.
		 
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Now they're gonna
		look at this picture,
		이제 이런 조를 보면,
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	and they're gonna think
		that I am a terrible mother,
		가족들이 나를 
		자기 자식도 제대로 못 돌보는
00:12:55	and they're gonna think
		that I am a terrible mother,
		 
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	that I can't even
		take care of my own child.
		형편없는 엄마로 생각할거야
00:12:58	that I can't even
		take care of my own child.
		 
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	I think your reputation is set.
		엄마 평판은 이미 자자한거 같은데요
00:12:59	I think your reputation is set.
		 
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	I can still do this with my arm
		제 팔이 아직도 이런건
00:13:00	I can still do this with my arm
		 
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	'cause I slept
		in the sink till I was 3.
		3살 때 까지 
		싱크대에서 자서 그런거잖아요
00:13:02	'cause I slept
		in the sink till I was 3.
		 
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	Ha-lo!
		헤일로!
00:13:03	Ha-lo!
		 
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	People are here.
		I'll deal with Joe.
		다들 왔네요,
		조는 제가 데리고 있을게요
00:13:05	People are here.
		I'll deal with Joe.
		 
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	- Okay.

		아빠, 엄마한테 말하셔야 돼요
00:13:13	Dad, you have to confess to mom.
		 
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	Clearing your conscience
		is the only way to make this stop.
		죄책감을 없애는 것이
		이걸 멈추는 방법이에요
00:13:15	Clearing your conscience
		is the only way to make this stop.
		 
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:15	Really?
		정말이니?
00:13:15	Really?
		 
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:16	I hope so, or else I have to rewrite
		the whole end of my paper.
		그래야죠, 아니면 레포트 결론부분을
		처음부터 다시 써야 되는데요
00:13:18	I hope so, or else I have to rewrite
		the whole end of my paper.

		둘만 왔니?
		나머지는 어딨어?
00:13:20	Just the two of you?

		캠, 부탁 좀 하자 -- 미첼에게 전화 해서
		후딱 튀어오라고 해
00:13:26	Cam, do me a favor -- call Mitchell

00:13:26	I'm right here, dad.
		아빠, 저 여기 있어요

00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	You opened the door for me.
		아빠가 문 열어주셨잖아요
00:13:30	You opened the door for me.
		 
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	You thanked me for bringing

		그리고 와인 가져와서
		고맙다고 하셨잖아요
00:13:32	You thanked me for bringing
		a bottle of chardonnay.
		 
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	Doesn't sound like me.
		난 고맙다고 안하는데
00:13:33	Doesn't sound like me.
		 
00:13:33	 
		 
00:13:35	Hey, guys. We're here.

00:16:48	Um, I lost my real ring
		a few months ago,
		음, 결혼 반지를
		몇달 전에 잃어버렸는데
00:16:49	Um, I lost my real ring
		a few months ago,
		 
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	and I just realized
		it must have fallen
		그리고 방금 내가 릴리한테 준
00:16:51	and I just realized
		it must have fallen
		 
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:51	in the box of clothes
		I gave to Lily.
		옷 상자 안에 떨어트린게 생각났어
00:16:53	in the box of clothes
		I gave to Lily.
		 
00:16:53	 
		 
00:16:53	Why'd you take it off?
		애초에 왜 반지를 뺐는데?
00:16:54	Why'd you take it off?
		 
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	Well, I got pulled over,
		도로경찰한테 걸려서,
00:16:56	Well, I got pulled over,
		 
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	and I wanted to flirt
		my way out of the ticket
		티켓 좀 안끊을 수 있을까 하고
00:16:59	and I wanted to flirt
		my way out of the ticket
		 
00:16:59	 
		 
00:16:59	by pretending I was single
		미혼인척 하면서
		경찰한테 좀 꼬리쳤거든
00:17:01	by pretending I was single
		 
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:01	and it worked,
		and I kind of liked it.
		근데 그게 통하니까,
		기분이 좀 좋더라고
00:17:03	and it worked,
		and I kind of liked it.
		 
00:17:03	 
		 
00:17:03	And then I felt so guilty
		about liking it
		그리고 나서 그 기분에 죄책감이 들었어
00:17:05	And then I felt so guilty
		about liking it
		 
00:17:05	 
		 
00:17:05	that I just wanted
		to erase the whole thing.
		모든 걸 다 지워버리고 싶었지
00:17:07	that I just wanted
		to erase the whole thing.
		 
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	So you lied?
		그래서 거짓말 한거야?
00:17:08	So you lied?
		 
00:17:08	 
		 
00:17:08	Yes. I lied.
		I'm sorry.
		응, 했어
		정말 미안해
00:17:10	Yes. I lied.
		I'm sorry.
		 
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:10	Does that make me
		a terrible person?
		나 정말 나쁘지?
00:17:12	Does that make me
		a terrible person?
		 
00:17:12	 
		 
00:17:12	- No, no. Are you kidding me?
		- No?
		- 아냐, 당연히 아니지
		- 아니야?
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	We've been married
		for a long time.
		우린 결혼한지 오래 됐잖아
00:17:17	We've been married
		for a long time.
		 
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	Of course we're gonna
		have our little secrets.
		서로 작은 비밀들을 가지는건 당연하지
00:17:19	Of course we're gonna
		have our little secrets.
		 
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	The important thing
		중요한 건
00:17:21	The important thing
		 
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	is that we know the difference
		해롭지 않은 자유와
00:17:22	is that we know the difference
		 
00:17:22	 
		 
00:17:22	between a harmless indulgence
		진짜 경솔한 행동 사이의
00:17:23	between a harmless indulgence

		그래, 그래, 만약에--
		만약에 그게 그렇게 성질내야
00:17:50	Yeah, yeah, maybe --

00:17:50	 
		 
00:17:50	for you to pay attention to me --
		신경을 써주는 거라면
00:17:51	for you to pay attention to me --
		 
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	throw a temper tantrum
		like -- like Joe.
		나도 조처럼-- 
00:17:53	throw a temper tantrum
		like -- like Joe.
		 
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	I could just throw a big...
		temper tantrum that --
		나도 완전 성질내고--
00:17:56	I could just throw a big...
		temper tantrum that --
		 
00:17:56	 
		 
00:17:56	or if I make a mess
		of everything and...
		아니면 내가
		완전 다 망쳐버리고--
00:17:58	or if I make a mess
		of everything and...
		 
00:17:58	 
		 
00:18:08	I feel like that
		was aimed at me.
		방금 그거 나한테 하는 얘기 같던데
00:18:10	I feel like that
		was aimed at me.
		 
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:11	You want to talk about it?
		더 얘기해볼래?
00:18:12	You want to talk about it?
		 
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	Or I could just play some piano.
		그냥 피아노나 치죠, 뭐
00:18:13	Or I could just play some piano.
		 
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	So I'm in the ballpark.
		그럼 내가 지금 야구장에 있는 거구만
00:18:14	So I'm in the ballpark.
		 
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:16	Look.
		보렴
00:18:17	Look.
		 
00:18:17	 
		 
00:18:18	If it seems sometimes
		like we don't notice you,
		만약 우리가 너를 무시한다고 느꼈다면
00:18:21	If it seems sometimes
		like we don't notice you,
		 
00:18:21	 
		 
00:18:21	maybe that is because
		we are focused
		그건 아마 우리가 각자의 멍청한 문제에
00:18:23	maybe that is because
		we are focused
		 
00:18:23	 
		 
00:18:23	on our own stupid problems,
		너무 집중을 해서 그런거다,
00:18:26	on our own stupid problems,
		 
00:18:26	 
		 
00:18:27	and you're so steady.
		그리고 넌 항상 한결같잖니
00:18:28	and you're so steady.
		 
00:18:28	 
		 
00:18:28	Oh, you mean boring.
		오, 지루하다구요
00:18:29	Oh, you mean boring.
		 
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	- No.
		- Yeah.
		- 아니다
		- 네
00:18:30	- No.
		- Yeah.
		 
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	Calm.
		침착한거지
00:18:31	Calm.
		 
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	Because you live your life
		the way you want to.
		왜냐하면 넌 항상
		네가 원하는 삶을 사니까
00:18:33	Because you live your life
		the way you want to.
		 
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:36	In fact, you inspired me recently.
		사실, 너에게 최근 많은걸 배웠다
00:18:37	In fact, you inspired me recently.
		 
00:18:37	 
		 
00:18:37	- Oh, how so?
		- Well...
		- 오, 어떻게요?
		- 글쎄...
00:18:39	- Oh, how so?
		- Well...
		 
00:18:39	 
		 
00:18:41	Fine.
		좋아
00:18:42	 
		 
00:18:44	I've been going
		through this thing lately.
		내가 최근 겪고 있는 일인데,
00:18:45	I've been going
		through this thing lately.
		 
00:18:45	 
		 
00:18:45	It all started when I noticed
		공원 구석에서 어떤 남자들이
00:18:47	It all started when I noticed
		 
00:18:47	 
		 
00:18:47	a group of guys
		in the corner in the park.
		모여있는 걸 보고 시작됐지
00:18:50	a group of guys
		in the corner in the park.
		 
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:50	And, uh, honestly, when I first
		found out what they were doing,
		솔직히, 내가 처음
		그들이 하는 것을 봤을 땐
00:18:52	And, uh, honestly, when I first
		found out what they were doing,
		 
00:18:52	 
		 
00:18:52	I thought it was kind of weird,
		좀 이상하다고 생각했단다
00:18:53	I thought it was kind of weird,
		 
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	but I found I kept
		thinking about it.
		그런데 그게
		잊혀지지 않는 거야
00:18:55	but I found I kept
		thinking about it.
		 
00:18:55	 
		 
00:18:57	And I thought
		I'd give it a whirl.
		그래서 한번 해보기로 결심했다
00:18:58	And I thought
		I'd give it a whirl.
		 
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	Ok-- okay. Go on.
		네, 계속 말씀하세요
00:19:00	Ok-- okay. Go on.
		 
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	I think you know
		where I'm going with this,
		넌 아마 내가
		무슨 말 하려는지 알거다,
00:19:01	I think you know
		where I'm going with this,
		 
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	but one of the older guys
		showed me the ropes.
		그런데 거기 사람들 중 한 명이
		나한테 끈을 건네고
00:19:04	but one of the older guys
		showed me the ropes.
		 
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Next thing I know,
		그 다음부터,
00:19:05	Next thing I know,
		 
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	I'm hanging out at that park
		in that corner every day
		나는 그 공원 구석에
		매일 가게 됐다
00:19:08	I'm hanging out at that park
		in that corner every day
		 
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	and loving it.
		그리고 그걸 좋아하게 됐지
00:19:09	 
		 
00:19:09	Uh-huh.
		아, 네
00:19:10	Uh-huh.
		 
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	But I must have also
		got some shame about it
		하지만 아마
		그에 대한 부끄러움도 있었던 모양이야
00:19:12	But I must have also
		got some shame about it
		 
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:12	because it feels good
		when I'm doing it, but...
		막상 할 때는
		기분이 좋지만..
00:19:15	because it feels good
		when I'm doing it, but...
		 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:16	Is that me now?
		이게 정말 나인가?
00:19:17	Is that me now?
		 
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:18	A guy with a show dog.
		도그쇼에 나가는 남자말야
00:19:19	A guy with a show dog.
		 
00:19:19	 
		 
00:19:19	There it is!
		그거군요!
00:19:20	There it is!
		 
00:19:20	 
		 
00:19:20	Okay, see,
		I-I knew what it wasn't.
		그래요, 
		아닌 줄 알았어
00:19:21	Okay, see,
		I-I knew what it wasn't.
		 
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	I just wasn't sure what it was.
		근데 정말 아닌건지 확실치 않아서요
00:19:23	I just wasn't sure what it was.
		 
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:23	In fact, there's
		a show right now,
		사실, 지금도
		쇼가 하나 하는 중인데
00:19:24	In fact, there's
		a show right now,
		 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	but... ah, I'm not gonna go.
		근데, 난.. 안갈란다
00:19:26	but... ah, I'm not gonna go.
		 
00:19:26	 
		 
00:19:26	No, no. D--
		아뇨, 아뇨, 
00:19:28	No, no. D--
		 
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:28	- I could tell this is important to you.
		- No.
		- 아빠한테 엄청 중요한 일인 것 같은데요
		- 아니
00:19:30	- I could tell this is important to you.
		- No.
		 
00:19:30	 
		 
00:19:30	You -- you should go.
		You should go.
		가셔야죠,
		가세요
00:19:32	You -- you should go.
		You should go.
		 
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	I don't want to sneak out,
		몰래 가고 싶지 않아
00:19:33	I don't want to sneak out,
		 
00:19:33	 
		 
00:19:33	and I don't want people
		to know about it.
		그리고 사람들이
		알게 되는 것도 싫다
00:19:35	and I don't want people
		to know about it.
		 
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	Dad.
		아빠
00:19:36	Dad.
		 
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	A wise man once told me,
		한 현명한 사람이
		저에게 말해주길
00:19:39	A wise man once told me,
		 
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	"I don't get it,
		but if that's who you are,
		"난 이해는 못하지만,
		그게 만약 네 모습이라면,
00:19:42	"I don't get it,
		but if that's who you are,
		 
00:19:42	 
		 
00:19:42	don't you dare
		be ashamed of it."
		부끄러워하지만은 말아라"
00:19:44	don't you dare
		be ashamed of it."
		 
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:47	I did handle that kind of well.
		내가 그건 좀 잘했지
00:19:49	I did handle that kind of well.
		 
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:49	Yeah, yeah, well...
		네, 네, 그래요
00:19:51	Yeah, yeah, well...
		 
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	And it wasn't easy.
		쉽지만은 않았단다
00:19:52	And it wasn't easy.
		 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:54	I just never pictured
		my kid a lawyer.
		내 자식이 변호사가 되는건
		상상도 못했거든
00:19:56	I just never pictured
		my kid a lawyer.
		 
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:57	It's scary to let people
		see the real you,
		사람들이 나의 본모습을
		알게 되는건 두렵습니다
00:19:59	It's scary to let people
		see the real you,
		 
00:19:59	 
		 
00:20:00	even when those people
		are your own family.
		그들이 제 가족일때도 말이죠
00:20:02	even when those people
		are your own family.
		 
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:03	But aren't they the ones
		we should be least worried about,
		하지만 그들만은
		우리가 걱정할 필요가 없지 않을까요?
00:20:05	But aren't they the ones
		we should be least worried about,
		 
00:20:05	 
		 
00:20:06	the ones who will love us
		without judging,
		조건 없이 우리를 사랑하고
00:20:08	the ones who will love us
		without judging,
		 
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	who forgive our faults and
		celebrate our imperfections?
		잘못을 용서해주며
		단점을 감싸주니까요
00:20:10	who forgive our faults and
		celebrate our imperfections?
		 
00:20:10	 
		 
00:20:10	Maybe even encourage us
		그리고 그들은 우리의 진정한 본모습을
00:20:12	Maybe even encourage us
		 
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	to let our true selves
		shine through?
		세상에 보일 수 있도록 격려해줍니다
00:20:14	to let our true selves
		shine through?
		 
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	Wait, wait. Hang on.
		Wait, wait.
		잠깐, 잠깐, 기다려
		잠깐
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:17	Okay.
		좋아
00:20:18	Okay.
		 
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:22	I think you look beautiful.
		엄마 잘 나오셨는데요
00:20:23	I think you look beautiful.
		 
00:20:23	 
		 
00:20:23	I look old.
		늙어보여
00:20:24	I look old.
		 
00:20:24	 
		 
00:20:24	All my cousins
		are going to see this.
		모든 사촌들이
		이 사진을 볼텐데
00:20:26	All my cousins
		are going to see this.
		 
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	Click the button that makes
		my wrinkles go away.
		꼭 포샵해서
		주름 다 없애야돼
00:20:29	Click the button that makes
		my wrinkles go away.
		 
00:20:29	 
		 
00:20:32	- What happened?
		- Nothing.
		- 무슨 일이니?
		- 아무것도 아니에요
00:20:33	- What happened?
		- Nothing.
		 
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:34	It's not nothing.
		You're limping!
		아무것도 아니긴,
		절뚝거리잖니!
00:20:36	It's not nothing.
		You're limping!
		 
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	Were you trying to do
		the Russian dance again?
		또 그 러시아 춤 춘거야?
00:20:38	Were you trying to do
		the Russian dance again?
		 
00:20:38
