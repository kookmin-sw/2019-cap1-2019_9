		안녕, 리스본. 
00:00:51	 
		 
00:00:51	What do we have here?
		뭐 찾아낸 것 있어?
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:53	Somebody named Theissens.
		남자 이름은 테시스.
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	He doesn't have a wallet on him,
		but I'm not thinking robbery.
		몸에 지갑이 없지만 강도 사건 같지는 않아. 
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	Looks like
		a puritan tailor shop.
		청교도가 드나드는 양복점 같네. 
00:01:02	 
		 
00:01:02	Helpful. That's it?
		그게 다야? 큰 도움 되네. 
00:01:04	 
		 
00:01:04	That's all you're gonna say?
		그게 준비한 말의 다야? 
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:05	Till I think of something
		useful to say, yes.
		더 괜찮은 할말이 떠오르기 전까진 그래.

00:01:10	No murder weapon,
		흉기는 발견되지 않았습니다.

00:01:13	 
		 
00:01:13	In his mouth?
		입에서?
00:01:14	 
		 
00:01:14	This is definitely not
		a robbery.
		절대로 강도사건은 아니군. 
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:16	Crime of passion?
		우발 범죄일까요?

		was solved.
		산 호아킨 사건은 종결되었는데요.
00:05:47

00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:50	the father
		of the first victim.

		그 점이 충분히 납득가지 않습니다. 
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:53	Well, there was
		conclusive evidence.
		결정적인 증거들이 있었죠.
00:05:55	 
		 
00:05:55	There was the murder weapon,
		흉기가 있었고 
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	Panzer's blood
		on Maier's clothing,
		메이어 옷에 묻은 팬저의 혈흔이 있었고. 
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	not to mention
		the confession Maier wrote
		자살하기 전 
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	before killing himself.
		메이어가 자백한 유서는 말할 것도 없구요.
00:06:02	 
		 
00:06:02	Right. Odd, don't you think?
		그래요. 좀 기묘하다, 그렇게 생각지 않습니까? 
00:06:04	 
		 
00:06:04	I mean, why would
		he go to such lengths
		제 말은, 메이어는 왜 레드존처럼 보이기 위해 
00:06:06	 
		 
00:06:06	to make it look like
		Red John was the killer?
		그토록 애를 썼느냐 하는 겁니다. 
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:08	It doesn't make any sense.
		말이 되지 않아요.
00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	And why would he send CBI
		a video of me?
		그리고 왜 CBI에 절 미행한 비디오를 보냈던 거죠?
00:06:13	 
		 
00:06:15	Who can fathom the mind
		of a desperate man?

		to clear the Plaza,
		경찰이 광장을 비우라면서 
00:06:40	 
		 
00:06:40	then just arrested everybody.
		이내 저희를 다 체포해갔어요.
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	We didn't get out
		until about an hour ago.
		한시간 전에야 겨우 풀려났죠.
00:06:44

		윅 테시스와의 관계는 어떻게 됩니까?
00:06:46	 
		 
00:06:46	We were working with him

		테시스의 다음 컬렉션을 돕고 있었어요.
00:06:48

		패션학교로 찾아왔죠.
00:06:50	 
		 
00:06:50	He wanted to work with people
		산업 논리에 아직 물들지 않은 
00:06:51	 
		 
00:06:51	that were not yet tainted
		by the industry.
		사람들과 일하고 싶었던 거군요.
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
		맞아요.
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:56	I mean, he'd been screwed over
		once before.
		그걸로 한번 신세 망쳤으니까. 
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:58	Wasn't gonna make
		that mistake again.
		그런 실수를 또 할 순 없었겠죠.
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	Everybody wanted to know
		what he was doing--
		테시스가 무슨 작업을 하는지 알아내려고 
00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	calling, nosing around.
		전화하고 시끄럽게 굴고 난리였어요.
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	That--that's why
		he built the secret room?
		그래서 밀실을 만든거군요?
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:07	So no one could see the clothes?
		작업이 공개되지 않게 하려고? 
00:07:08	 
		 
00:07:08	Where'd the money come from
		for all this?
		비용은 어디서 나왔습니까? 
00:07:10	 
		 
00:07:10	We made dresses
		for the guy downstairs
		아시아에 내다팔 수 있게 
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:14	for him to send back to Asia.
		아래층 남자한테 돈받고 옷을 만들었어요.
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	Knockoffs of haute couture.
		짝퉁 명품들요. 
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	Mr. Liu?
		With the import/export business?
		무역하는 리우씨?
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	Yeah. It--it was good training.
		네. 좋은 훈련이 됐어요. 
00:07:22	 
		 
00:07:22	Sure. Okay. Any idea why Mr. Liu
		리우씨가 여러분 셋을 
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	would name you three
		as the most likely suspects?
		주요 용의자로 점찍었는데 왠지 알겠습니까?
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	No.
		아니요.
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	He's just pissed
		'cause we weren't gonna
		우리가 짝퉁을 더는 만들지 않으니까 
00:07:30	 
		 
00:07:30	make any more knockoffs
		for him.
		화가 났겠죠.
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	Yeah, once the collection
		was finished,
		컬렉션만 끝나면 
00:07:33	 
		 
00:07:33	Wyck told him
		that we were done.
		관두겠다고 윅이 말했거든요. 
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	And when were you gonna show
		this, um, collection?
		그럼 그 컬렉션이란건 언제입니까?
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:37	Next week.
		다음주요.
00:07:38	 
		 
00:07:38	Everyone in the fashion world
		was coming out for it.
		패션계 인사는 총출동할걸요.
00:07:42	 
		 
00:07:42	And Theissens
		was okay with that?
		테시스는 괜찮았나요?
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	He didn't have
		any bad feelings?
		유감이라던지 없었나요?
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:46	He made his peace with
		the business aspects, you know?
		사업은 사업으로만 봤어요.
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	Said it was a necessary evil.
		필요악이라면서. 
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	Said if you wanna get
		your vision to the world,
		세상에서 자기 뜻을 펼치고 싶으면 
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	you gotta work with the devil.
		악마와 손잡아야 한다고. 
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:56	Even Guy Duval.
		설령 그게 가이 드발이라 할지라도.
00:07:57	 
		 
00:07:57	What about Guy Duval?
		가이 드발에 대해 아나요?
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	He's this big
		corporate fashion guy.
		패션계 거물이죠.
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:03	And, um, two nights ago,
		그리고 이틀 전쯤엔가 
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	after this dinner
		at a hotel in San Francisco,
		샌프란시스코의 호텔에서 저녁식사를 하고 
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	Wyck and him were, like,
		hugely arguing.
		윅이 그 사람과 무지 싸웠어요.
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:14	- Hey, boss. What's up?
		- I need you to talk to Liu
		- 반장님?
		- 리우를 찾아서 
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	about paying Theissens
		to knock off couture dresses
		테시스에게 돈을 주고 
00:08:19	 
		 
00:08:19	for the Asian market.
		짝퉁 물건을 만들어 아시아에 수출한 일을 물어봐. 
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	Liu? He's not there?
		리우요? 거기 있는거 아니었어요?
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	I'm just leaving
		his warehouse now,
		내가 리우의 창고에서 막 나오는 길이야. 
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	and his employees said
		리우가 데리고 있는 직원들은 
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	that he went to speak to you
		at the CBI.
		리우가 CBI로 갔다고 하던데. 
00:08:27	 
		 
00:08:27	Well, somebody's lying.
		He's not here.
		거짓말이었나봐요. 여기 없어요. 
00:08:29	 
		 
00:08:29	All right.
		We need to find Liu.
		알았어. 리우 부터 찾아. 
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	We're headed to talk
		to Duval now. Keep in touch.

		무슨 벌써? 왜?
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	Cops went over to his residence.
		Liu was already gone.
		경찰이 리우 집에 갔더니 없더랍니다. 
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	Neighbors say that
		three Asian guys came over,
		이웃말론 아시안 남자 셋이 와서 
00:09:12	 
		 
00:09:12	and he left with them

00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	Would it be too much to ask you
		to schedule a meeting properly
		이런 식으로 무작정 쳐들어 오기보단 
00:13:02	 
		 
00:13:02	rather than barging in here
		like this?
		정해진 때 회의에 참석하는게 
		자네한텐 그렇게 힘든 일인가? 
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	I'm so sorry.
		I didn't realize.
		죄송합니다. 생각이 짧았습니다. 
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:09	How's your case going?
		사건의 진행은? 
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	It's progressing.
		진척을 보이고 있습니다. 
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	We're gonna interview a suspect
		if you'd like to sit in.
		용의자를 심문할 참인데 괜찮으시면 들어오시죠.
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	Unless you're busy.
		바쁘지 않으시다면. 
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	Paperwork.
		The bane of management.
		서류작업. 관리직의 숙명이지. 
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:21	I would like for you to catch
		me up on that case, though,
		그 대신 이후 브리핑을 부탁하네. 
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	when you have a moment.
		자네 시간 될때. 
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	Of course.
		Whenever you want.
		물론입니다. 편하신 아무때나 가능합니다. 
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	Um...
		음... 
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	how about 45 minutes
		in the bullpen?
		자네 팀에서 45분 뒤에 어떤가?
00:13:30	 
		 
00:13:30	Yes, sir.
		알겠습니다.
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:59	This is a mistake.
		실수하는 겁니다.
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:00	I got a little carried away.
		That's all.
		잠깐 평정을 잃었을 뿐이에요.
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	You threatened my colleague
		with a knife.
		당신은 제 동료를 칼로 위협했습니다. 
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	Mm. And you're also a suspect
		in Wyck Theissens' murder.
		그리고 윅 테센스 사건 용의자이기도 하지요.
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	Me?
		Why would I kill him?
		내가요? 내가 왜 죽여요? 
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:11	Well, you ruined Theissens' life
		by releasing that video.
		당신이 비디오를 유출시켜 테센스 인생을 망쳤으니
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	It's only natural that he'd
		like to return the favor
		테센스가 그 반대로 
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	and ruin yours.
		당신 인생도 망치려 하지 않았겠습니까. 
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:17	Wh-what are you
		talking about?
		무, 무슨 소리예요?
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	I'm talking about the fact
		that Duval wouldn't be happy
		당신이 드발 부인과 드발 몰래 
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	to know what you and his wife
		are doing behind his back.
		무슨 짓거리를 하는지 드발이 알아 좋을게 없단거죠.
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	What?
		뭐요?
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	If Theissens learned that
		you were cuckolding Duval,
		테시스가 당신과 드발 부인 관계를 알았다면 
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	then, uh, he has every reason
		to reveal that fact,
		폭로가 당연한 수순이고 
00:14:32	 
		 
00:14:32	which gives you
		every reason to kill him.
		당신이 테시스 입막음을 해야 하는 것도 당연할 터. 
00:14:35	 
		 
00:14:35	Okay, you can't say anything
		about me and Jacqueline.
		나랑 재클린에 대해 한마디만 해봐요.
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:38	If Duval found out,
		I'd be done.
		드발이 알면 난 끝장이야.
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	I'd never work again.
		다신 이 일 못할거예요.
00:14:43	 
		 
00:14:43	Where were you last night,
		Mr. Acosta?
		아코스타씨, 지난밤에 어디 계셨죠?
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:46	I was at the hotel.
		호텔에 있었습니다.
00:14:47	 
		 
00:14:47	Is there anybody
		who can verify that?
		증명할 사람은 있습니까?
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:52	Okay, listen...
		알겠어요.
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	If I tell you something,
		내가 뭐 가르쳐 드리죠.
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	you wouldn't let anybody know
		it was me that told you, right?
		내가 말했다고 하면 안돼요.
00:15:00	 
		 
00:15:00	- No.
		- It depends on what it is.
		- 그러죠.
		- 내용에 따라서요.
00:15:02	 
		 
00:15:02	Well, I wouldn't.
		She might.
		나는 안 말할건데, 저쪽은 모르겠네요.
00:15:04	 
		 
00:15:04	Okay, well, the thing is,
		그래요, 그게 뭐냐면 
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	Wyck and Duval did argue
		at dinner the other night.
		윅과 드발이 싸웠을 때 
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	I heard them.
		내가 들었어요.
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:10	It was about Tony.
		문제는 토니였어요.
00:15:12	 
		 
00:15:12	Who's Tony?
		토니가 누군데요?
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:13	Tony Redgrave. He's a photog.
		사진사 토니 레드그레이브.
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	Everybody uses him,
		but he's kind of a creep.
		인기있는 사진사지만 좀 변태스러워요.
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	Hmm.
		흠.
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	The thing is,
		everybody uses him.
		문제는 인기 사진사이기 때문에 
00:15:23	 
		 
00:15:23	So you can't say
		it was me that told you.
		내가 이런 말 한다는게 새나가면 안된단 거예요.
00:15:25	 
		 
00:15:25	I can't afford
		to piss him off, all right?
		토니 심기를 거스르면 내 능력으론 수습을 못하니까. 
00:15:27	 
		 
00:15:27	What were they talking about?
		무슨 얘길 하던가요?
00:15:29	 
		 
00:15:29	Wyck had brought in
		some kids,
		윅이 애들을 데려왔는데 
00:15:31	 
		 
00:15:31	and he was pissed
		that Tony was there.
		토니도 있다는 걸 알자 화를 냈어요.
00:15:33	 
		 
00:15:33	Oh, he was worried that Tony
		might get creepy with the kids?
		토니가 애들한테 무슨 짓을 할까봐?
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	You know, Tony--
		토니는... 
00:15:38	 
		 
00:15:38	he likes 'em young,
		you know?
		어린애들을 좋아해요. 알겠죠?
00:15:40	 
		 
00:15:40	Got it.
		알겠습니다.
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	- Thank you.
		- Got it.
		감사합니다. 
00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:49	So we go talk
		to Tony Redgrave, yes?
		그럼 토니 레드그레이브를 만나러 가는거지?
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:51	- Take somebody with you.
		- You're not coming?
		- 다른 사람 데려가.
		- 넌 안 가?
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	Lisbon, this could be your
		ticket out of this dead-end job.
		리스본. 이럴 때 나가서 바람도 쐬고 하는거야. 
00:15:55	 
		 
00:15:55	Ha ha. Wainright's coming in.
		He wants to check on things.
		핫-하. 웨인라이트야. 사건 보고하래. 
00:15:57	 
		 
00:15:57	More managing? I mean, what--
		I--someone's gotta do it.
		군기잡기? 이거야 원, 나, 참.... 누군가는 해야겠지. 
00:16:02	 
		 
00:16:04	So can we bring me up to date
		on the Theissens case?
		그럼 테시스 사건의 처음부터 설명해 주겠나? 
00:16:07	 
		 
00:16:07	Well, sir, the alibi for
		Theissens' assistants hold up.
		테시스의 어시스턴트들은 알리바이가 확실합니다. 
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	They were booked
		and held overnight.
		지난밤새 구류되어 있었습니다. 
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:12	But the landlord, Liu--
		하지만 건물 소유주 리우는, 
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:14	the one that was selling
		Theissens' knockoffs--
		테시스가 만든 명품 짝퉁을 취급했는데 
00:16:16	 
		 
00:16:16	he disappeared in a hurry.
		최근 돌연히 사라졌습니다. 
00:16:17	 
		 
00:16:17	And we got a court order
		over to the phone company
		법원 명령을 끊어 리우의 전화를 추적할 수 있도록 
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:20	- to track his phone.
		- Okay. I can make a call,
		- 준비하고 있습니다. 
		- 좋아. 내가 법원에 전화해 
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:22	get this at the top
		of their list.
		조속히 처리하도록 부탁하지. 
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:23	If he had a smartphone on him,
		만약 리우의 전화가 스마트폰이라면 
00:16:24	 
		 
00:16:24	we might even be able to get
		an exact location on the GPS.
		정확한 위치 추적이 가능할텐데. 
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:27	If he had his phone on him.
		아직 전화를 소지하고 있다면 말이죠.
00:16:29	 
		 
00:16:29	Well, let's hope.
		그러길 바라야지. 
00:16:30	 
		 
00:16:30	Uh, we're also looking
		into Guy Duval.
		그리고 가이 드발 쪽으로도 조사 중입니다. 
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	Duval was facing
		a shareholder revolt.
		드발은 최근 주주들의 저항에 직면했습니다. 
00:16:35	 
		 
00:16:35	He had a lot pinned on making
		this Theissens deal go through.
		테시스를 사업에 끌어들여야만 했죠.
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	So if Theissens got cold feet
		and backed out...
		때문에 테시스가 꽁무니를 빼거나 했다면 
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:39	Then Duval would look weak,
		드발이 어려워지는거고 
00:16:40	 
		 
00:16:40	and that would make
		his position look vulnerable.
		회사내 입지도 어려워졌겠죠. 
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:42	And he'd do anything to stop
		that from what I can tell.
		그러니 드발도 갖은 수를 다 썼을 겁니다. 
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:43	Jane and Van Pelt are looking
		제인과 반펠트는 사진사인
00:16:45	 
		 
00:16:45	into the photographer,
		Tony Redgrave.
		토니 레드그레이브에게 갔습니다. 
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	Tony Redgrave.
		And what reason would he have
		테시스 사건과 어떤 식으로 
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	- for murdering Theissens?
		- Uh, we don't know.
		- 관련이 있는지? 
		- 모르겠습니다. 
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:50	It could just be Acosta
		trying to throw us off.
		아코스타가 저희 관심을 돌리려 던진 말일수도 있습니다.
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	But Redgrave
		does have priors.
		하지만 그 밖에도 볼 일이 있습니다.
00:16:54	 
		 
00:16:54	What for?
		어떤?
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:56	Providing drugs
		and alcohol to minors.
		미성년자에게 술과 약물을 제공했답니다. 
00:16:58	 
		 
00:17:00	Um, you, uh, you definitely have
		your work cut out for you...
		보아하니 아주 빈틈없이 진행하고 있군.
00:17:02	 
		 
00:17:02	So I will leave you to it.
		Excellent.
		계속 자네를 믿고 맡기겠네. 훌륭해. 
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:10	This is Wainright.
		웨인라이트입니다. 
00:17:11	 
		 
00:17:11	Hey. I just want
		to acknowledge
		레드존 파일이 도착했더군요.
00:17:13	 
		 
00:17:13	receipt of the Red John files.
		방금 연락 받았어요.
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	Than you for that.
		감사합니다. 
00:17:16	 
		 
00:17:16	Sure. Yeah.
		Anything I can do to help.
		뭐든지 말씀만 하십쇼.
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	Listen, I am assuming
		we're on the same page,
		국장님과 제 생각이 거의 같을테지만
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:21	but you didn't tell your people
		about this, did you?
		그래도 이 일 다른데 말씀은 않으셨겠죠?
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	No. I saw no need.
		그럴 필요 못 느꼈습니다. 
00:17:25	 
		 
00:17:25	I agree. Thanks.
		저도 같은 생각입니다. 감사합니다. 
00:17:28	 
		 
00:17:34	Baris Acar?
		배리스 아카씨?
00:17:35	 
		 
00:17:35	Ah. Yes, ma'am.
		그렇습니다.
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:37	Susan Darcy, FBI.
		FBI의 수잔 다아시입니다. 
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	Uh, did I do
		something wrong?
		제가 뭐 잘못한 게 있나요? 
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	No,
		it's nothing like that.
		아뇨, 그런게 아닙니다. 
00:17:44	 
		 
00:17:44	I've never been interviewed
		by the FBI before.
		FBI가 찾아온 건 처음이라서요.
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:46	Mr. Acar, this is
		your signature, isn't it?
		아카씨, 본인 서명이시죠?
00:17:51	 
		 
00:17:51	Yes, ma'am, it is.
		그렇습니다. 
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:53	And this is a form telling me
		that Patrick Jane
		그리고 내용은 패트릭 제인이 
00:17:55	 
		 
00:17:55	brought a visitor here to see
		the body of Timothy Carter.
		방문객을 동행해 티모시 카터 유체를 봤다는 말이구요.
00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	Mr. Jane shot and killed him
		in a mall food court.
		제인씨는 쇼핑몰에서 카터를 쏘아 죽였습니다.
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	Do you remember that visit?
		그 방문 기억하시나요?
00:18:04	 
		 
00:18:04	Uh, I sure do.
		물론이죠.
00:18:06	 
		 
00:18:07	Can you tell me about it?
		자세히 말씀해 주시겠어요?
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	Well, it stuck in my head
		because it was kind of weird.
		좀 괴상한 경우여서 기억에 남아 있네요.
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	Weird? What do you mean?
		괴상했다뇨?
00:18:14	 
		 
00:18:14	She was blind.
		방문객이 맹인이었거든요.
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	That's kind of weird, right?
		괴상하잖아요.
00:18:18	 
		 
00:18:18	Mr. Jane's guest
		was a blind woman?
		제인씨가 데려온 방문객이 맹인이었다구요?
00:18:20	 
		 
00:18:20	I couldn't figure out
		why he brought her.
		왜 그 사람을 데려왔는지는 모르겠는데 
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:22	I mean, she was blind.
		왜냐면, 맹인이잖아요.
00:18:24	 
		 
00:18:27	Thank you, Mr. Acar.
		That's all.
		감사합니다, 아카씨. 충분합니다.
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:29	Ah.
		아,
00:18:30	 
		 
00:18:30	Oh, Mr. Acar,
		아카씨. 
00:18:31	 
		 
00:18:31	you do know not to speak
		to anyone about this?
		이 일 아무에게도 말씀하지 말아 주세요.
00:18:34	 
		 
00:18:34	Whatever you say, ma'am.
		말씀하신대로 하겠습니다. 
00:18:36	 
		 
00:18:50	Uh, excuse me.
		Is that, uh, Tony Redgrave?
		토니 레드그레이브?
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:53	Sasha, Sasha, Sasha...
		사샤, 사샤!
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	I'm an artist, yeah?
		Not a fishmonger.
		난 예술 하는거지 냉동 생선 다루는거 아냐. 
00:18:59	 
		 
00:18:59	God sakes, relax.
		제발 긴장 좀 풀어. 
00:19:01	 
		 
00:19:01	How am I supposed to relax?
		어떻게 그래? 
00:19:02	 
		 
00:19:02	Tony, you're so bloody selfish.
		토니, 넌 정말 인간 말종이야. 
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	Wyck is dead. He's dead.
		윅이 죽었다고. 
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	Circle of life, babe,
		circle of life.
		인간은 모두 생로병사야, 자기야.
00:19:11	 
		 
00:19:11	All right.
		Let's try a couple more.
		몇장 더 찍자. 
00:19:12	 
		 
00:19:13	That sullen, grieving look...
		침울하고 애달픈 표정, 
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	I like it.
		마음에 들어. 
00:19:17	 
		 
00:19:17	You Tony?
		토니?
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	I'm agent Van Pelt.
		This is Patrick Jane,
		반펠트 요원, 이쪽은 패트릭 제인입니다. 
00:19:21	 
		 
00:19:21	from the California Bureau
		of Investigation.
		캘리포니아 수사국에서 나왔습니다. 
00:19:24	 
		 
00:19:24	Oh, my God. I love @@/you.@@\
		어쩜, 자기 마음에 든다. 
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:27	Take your clothes off.
		Both of you.
		당장 옷 벗어, 둘 다. 
00:19:28	 
		 
00:19:31	I'm just kidding.
		Look at your face.
		농담이에요. 표정 변하는 거 봐. 
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	We're here about Wyck Theissens.
		윅 테시스 때문에 왔습니다. 
00:19:36	 
		 
00:19:36	It's really sad, right?
		Really sad.
		슬퍼, 참 슬픈 일이야.
00:19:39	 
		 
00:19:39	I was about to shoot
		his comeback campaign.
		복귀작 작업 같이 하려 했는데. 
00:19:41	 
		 
00:19:41	What a huge bummer that was.
		다된밥에 코빠쳤지 뭐야.
00:19:44	 
		 
00:19:44	Stabbed to death, right?
		찔려 죽었다죠?
00:19:47	 
		 
00:19:47	What with? A knife? Razor?
		뭘로? 칼? 면도날?
00:19:50	 
		 
00:19:50	Shut up! Tony, God!
		토니, 제발 좀 닥치지 못해? 
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:52	We were like family.
		우린 가족같은 사이였다고. 
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:54	We came up together,
		me and Wyck.
		나랑 윅은 한팀이었어.
00:19:56	 
		 
00:19:56	I walked in every single one
		of his shows.
		모든 작업을 같이 했어.
00:19:59	 
		 
00:19:59	Yes!
		그래!
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:00	That's it, Sasha.
		그거야, 사샤.
00:20:03	 
		 
00:20:03	Now you're killing it.
		이제 좀 받네. 
00:20:04	 
		 
00:20:04	Where were you last night,
		Mr. Redgrave?
		지난밤에 어디 계셨습니까?
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	Oh, uh...
		어...
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:09	Let's see...
		보자...
00:20:11	 
		 
00:20:11	I was... downstairs...
		아래층에서... 
00:20:14	 
		 
00:20:14	at the pool for a little bit.
		Then some drinks at the bar,
		수영 좀 하고, 술 좀 마시고, 
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	then dinner,
		then we came up here.
		저녁 먹고, 다시 올라왔죠.
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	Who's "we"?
		누구랑요?
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	I don't know. Everyone.
		몰라요. 다 섞여서. 
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	You came up here for a bit,
		didn't you, darling?
		자긴 좀 늦게 올라왔지. 
00:20:30	 
		 
00:20:30	Yes, you were.
		Chin up.
		고개 들어. 
00:20:32	 
		 
00:20:32	It's quite the act, this, uh,
		wide-eyed man-child bit.
		그 피터팬 캐릭터는 연출이죠? 
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	Nobody ever calls you
		on it, do they?
		여태 아무도 지적 안하던가요?
00:20:38	 
		 
00:20:40	I'm just really lucky,
		you know?
		내가 운이 좀 좋아요.
00:20:43	 
		 
00:20:43	It's just about living
		in the moment. Having some fun.
		인생 대충 즐기며 찰나만을 살면 되거든. 
00:20:47	 
		 
00:20:47	Ah, yes. The joys
		of living in the moment.
		그래요. 찰나의 기쁨. 
00:20:50	 
		 
00:20:50	All fun and games
		till someone gets hurt.
		누군가의 피를 보기 전까지는 그저 먹고 마시고 춤추고. 
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	How old are these kids?
		저 친구들은 몇살입니까?
00:20:55	 
		 
00:20:55	Everyone in here's an adult.
		여기 있는 모두는 성년이에요.
00:20:56	 
		 
00:20:56	They're here
		because they wanna be.
		자기 판단으로 여기 있는 거라구요.
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	Nobody's making anyone do
		anything they don't wanna do.
		강제하는 사람은 아무도 없어요.
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	You got it?
		알겠어요?
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	Loud and clear.
		확실히 알았습니다. 
00:21:03	 
		 
00:21:03	Did you make sure
		Theissens got it, too?
		테시스도 납득했을까요?
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:07	Don't think you're gonna
		put anything on me.
		나한테 뒤집어 씌울 생각 마요.
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	I didn't do
		anything to Wyck.
		난 윅한테 아무 짓도 안했어. 
00:21:11	 
		 
00:21:11	You get to do
		whatever you want
		아무도 뭐라할 엄두를 못 내니 
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	because no one cares enough
		to challenge it.
		당신 하고 싶은대로 하고 살았겠지만 
00:21:14	 
		 
00:21:14	But Theissens--
		he didn't approve, did he?
		테시스는 가만두지 않았던 거죠. 
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	If he thought you were messing
		with those kids of his,
		당신이 자기 애들을 건드린다고 생각했다면 
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	he'd have happily
		sent you to jail.
		당신을 기꺼이 콩밥 먹였을 겁니다. 
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:21	You've got it
		so twisted, man.
		너무 꼬아서 얘기하시는데. 
00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:23	Wyck was refusing to do
		anything with any of us.
		윅은 우리쪽 누구와도 일하기 싫다고 했어. 
00:21:27	 
		 
00:21:27	That's what I heard.
		난 그렇게 들었어요.
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	But Duval said
		it wasn't a problem.
		하지만 드발이 그건 문제가 아니라고 했지. 
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	He said he'd fix it.
		자기가 해결해 보겠다고. 
00:21:33	 
		 
00:21:34	Don't leave town without talking
		to us first, okay?
		통보 없이 무단으로 장소 이탈하지 마십쇼.
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:42	I could see Redgrave
		murdering Theissens
		감옥에 갈 게 두려운 나머지 
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	if he was afraid
		to go to jail.
		테시스를 죽였을 수 있다고 봐. 
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	Jane went to talk
		제인은 테시스의 어시들을 찾아 갔어요.
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:49	to Theissens' assistants again.
		Maybe they'll give us something.
		그 어시들이 뭔가 말해줄 지 모르죠. 
00:21:51	 
		 
00:21:51	Uh, then again, if what
		Redgrave says is true,
		그리고 레드그레이브 말이 사실이라면 
00:21:53	 
		 
00:21:53	Duval could be our killer.
		드발이 범인일수도 있어. 
00:21:55	 
		 
00:21:55	Stay there. Watch the lobby.
		거기 있으면서 지켜봐. 
00:21:57	 
		 
00:21:57	Will do.
		Any sign of Mr. Liu?
		알겠습니다. 리우는요? 
00:21:59	 
		 
00:21:59	A GPS on Liu's phone points
		to a warehouse in Oakland.
		리우 전화가 오클랜드 모 창고에 있대. 
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	Cho and Rigsby
		are checking it out now.
		조와 릭스비가 확인하러 갔어. 
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:05	Okay.
		알겠습니다.
00:22:06	 
		 
00:22:11	Yeah. I'll call you later.
		다시 전화할게. 
00:22:13	 
		 
00:22:13	Okay. Me, too.
		Yeah. Bye.
		나도야. 응. 
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	Sorry. Sarah.
		미안, 사라예요.
00:22:17	 
		 
00:22:17	According to GPS,
		he's in there.
		GPS에 따르면 저기야.
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:19	Okay. Let's go.
		갑시다.
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	Everything okay?
		무슨 일 없는거지?
00:22:22	 
		 
00:22:22	Yeah.
		I mean, it's complicated.
		네, 좀 복잡해지긴 했는데. 
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	Sarah's pregnant.
		사라가 임신했어요.
00:22:30	 
		 
00:22:30	Oh.
		어.
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:31	Congratulations.
		축하한다.
00:22:33	 
		 
00:22:33	Thanks.
		It's exciting, right?
		네. 신나는 일이에요, 그쵸?
00:22:35	 
		 
00:22:35	Yeah. I'm excited.
		신나는 일이어야죠.
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:43	Aah!
		아악!
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:50	Mr. Liu!
		This is the CBI!
		리우씨, CBI입니다!
00:22:52	 
		 
00:22:52	Nobody move!
		Hands where we can see 'em.
		꼼짝말고 머리위로 손 들어! 
00:22:56	 
		 
00:23:01	There--there's no problem
		here, sirs.
		형사님, 모두 괜찮습니다.
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:04	We're all friends.
		모두 친구예요.
00:23:07	 
		 
00:23:07	No problem.
		아무 일 없습니다.
00:23:09	 
		 
00:23:09	You can go. No problem.
		그냥 가셔도 된다니까요.
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	No problem.
		아무 문제 없어요.
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:39	Yes? Can I help you?
		무슨 일이세요?
00:23:41	 
		 
00:23:41	Rosalind Harker?
		로잘린드 하커?
00:23:42	 
		 
00:23:42	Yes. Who is it?
		네. 누구시죠?
00:23:44	 
		 
00:23:44	I'm Susan Darcy.
		I'm with the FBI.
		FBI의 수잔 다아시입니다. 
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:48	May I come in?
		들어가도 될까요?
00:23:49	 
		 
00:23:49	Sure.
		그럼요.
00:23:52	 
		 
00:23:58	Miss Harker,
		you recently paid a visit
		하커양, 최근에 새크라멘토 카운티 
00:23:59	 
		 
00:23:59	to the Sacramento county
		morgue.
		시체보관소에 방문하신 적이 있죠.
00:24:01	 
		 
00:24:01	Yes.
		네. 
00:24:04	 
		 
00:24:04	Did I do something wrong?
		That's--
		제가 뭘 잘못했나요?
00:24:06	 
		 
00:24:06	No, it was nothing like that,
		그런게 아닙니다.
00:24:07	 
		 
00:24:07	I just was wondering what
		the purpose of your visit was.
		방문 목적이 뭔지만 알고 싶어서요.
00:24:09	 
		 
00:24:09	Oh.
		아.
00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:11	Well, Patrick Jane wanted me to
		check if a man who was in there
		패트릭 제인씨가 같이 가서 시신이
00:24:16	 
		 
00:24:16	was my friend,
		Roy Taglioferro.
		제 친구인 로이 탈리아페로가 맞는지 확인해 달랬어요.
00:24:19	 
		 
00:24:19	Roy Taglioferro,
		also known as Red John?
		로이 탈리아페로, 즉 레드존 말이지요?
00:24:23	 
		 
00:24:23	Mm. Well,
		네. 
00:24:25	 
		 
00:24:25	that's what I've been told
		by the authorities, yes.
		당국에서는 그렇게 말하더군요.
00:24:28	 
		 
00:24:28	I suppose it must be true,
		아마 사실일거라 생각은 하지만 
00:24:31	 
		 
00:24:31	but I... still
		can't quite believe it.
		여전히 믿기는 어려워요.
00:24:34	 
		 
00:24:34	I understand.
		이해합니다.
00:24:37	 
		 
00:24:37	So was it Taglioferro
		in the morgue?
		그럼 시신은 탈리아페로였나요?
00:24:39	 
		 
00:24:39	No. It wasn't Roy.
		아뇨, 로이가 아니었어요.
00:24:42	 
		 
00:24:46	Well, thank you.
		I appreciate your time.
		시간 내주셔서 감사합니다. 
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:48	Oh.
		오.
00:24:49	 
		 
00:24:49	No, please, don't get up.
		I'll see myself out.
		아녜요, 알아서 갈테니 일어나지 마세요.
00:24:52	 
		 
00:24:52	Thank you.
		감사합니다. 
00:24:53	 
		 
00:24:53	You're welcome.
		천만에요.
00:24:55	 
		 
00:25:00	What's your connection
		to Liu?
		리우와의 관계는?
00:25:01	 
		 
00:25:01	What went down
		at the warehouse?
		창고에는 왜 있었던거지?
00:25:05	 
		 
00:25:05	No English.
		영어 못해.
00:25:08	 
		 
00:25:08	Lawyer.
		변호사.
00:25:10	 
		 
00:25:16	They can lawyer up
		all they want.
		전부 변호사 타령이네요.
00:25:18	 
		 
00:25:18	All we need
		is for you to testify.
		선생님이 증언하시는 수밖에 없겠습니다.
00:25:20	 
		 
00:25:20	Dream on, lady.
		I testify to nothing.
		꿈깨요, 아가씨. 난 아무 증언 안할거니까.
00:25:23	 
		 
00:25:23	You don't know these guys.
		저 사람들 몰라서 하는 소리요.
00:25:26	 
		 
00:25:26	So tell me about them.
		그럼 알게끔 말해 보세요.
00:25:28	 
		 
00:25:28	I import and export
		to China, understand?
		난 중국과 수출입을 하고 있소.
00:25:32	 
		 
00:25:32	I deal in electronics,
		fashion, luxury goods.
		전자제품, 의류, 명품 등을 다루지. 
00:25:36	 
		 
00:25:36	In my business, there are always
		gangsters who need paying off.
		이런 사업엔 늘 조직폭력단이 끼어들어 돈을 요구해. 
00:25:39	 
		 
00:25:39	Shanghai, Guangzhou, Macau--
		everywhere the same.
		상해, 광주, 마카오... 전부 똑같아. 
00:25:43	 
		 
00:25:43	What are they doing here?
		그들이 뭐라고 하던가요?
00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:44	I told 'em I had no more
		high-fashion copies for them.
		짝퉁 명품 의류를 더 이상 댈 수 없다고 말했지. 
00:25:47	 
		 
00:25:47	They came to change my mind.
		그러자 내 생각을 바꿔놓으러 왔소. 
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	So you think they went
		to Theissens first
		저 사람들이 테시스를 먼저 찾아가 
00:25:51	 
		 
00:25:51	to send a message to you?
		당신을 협박하려 했던 걸까요?
00:25:53	 
		 
00:25:53	Maybe.
		If so, forget about it.
		아마도. 그렇다면, 그냥 잊어버리쇼.
00:25:56	 
		 
00:25:56	You can't touch them.
		저 사람들은 건들 수 없어. 
00:25:58	 
		 
00:25:58	Really?
		그래요?
00:25:59	 
		 
00:25:59	Really.
		그래요. 
00:26:00	 
		 
00:26:00	Like MC Hammer.
		MC Hammer인가 가수도 그러잖아?
00:26:02	 
		 
00:26:09	Yeah, we hung out with Redgrave.
		레드그레이브와 어울린 적이 있죠.
00:26:12	 
		 
00:26:12	Dude knows how to party.
		끝내주는 파티를 하거든요.
00:26:13	 
		 
00:26:13	Theissens didn't like him
		much, though, did he?
		테시스가 싫어하긴 했지만요. 그렇죠?
00:26:16	 
		 
00:26:16	Wyck? Wyck hated Redgrave.
		윅? 윅은 싫어했죠.
00:26:19	 
		 
00:26:19	He represented everything that
		was wrong in the fashion world,
		윅의 말로는 레드그레이브가 
00:26:22	 
		 
00:26:22	in Wyck's opinion.
		패션업의 나쁜 점은 전부 모아놨댔어요.
00:26:24	 
		 
00:26:24	And he wouldn't have wanted you
		그래서 레드그레이브와 좀 
00:26:26	 
		 
00:26:26	to spend time with Redgrave,
		then?
		거리를 뒀으면 바랐던 거구요?
00:26:27	 
		 
00:26:28	Are you kidding?
		그 정돈줄 알아요?
00:26:30	 
		 
00:26:30	He would have freaked.
		발광했을걸요.
00:26:32	 
		 
00:26:32	He was real protective of us.
		부모님처럼 굴었어요.
00:26:34	 
		 
00:26:34	But come on. You gotta
		cut loose sometimes.
		하지만 사람이 때론 쉴수도 있잖아요.
00:26:37	 
		 
00:26:37	Hmm. I take it you three
		그나저나 세 사람은 
00:26:39	 
		 
00:26:39	are still planning
		to put the show on anyway?
		여전히 컬렉션에 나갈 작정인거구요?
00:26:42	 
		 
00:26:42	Yeah. We wanna do it
		for Wyck.
		윅을 위해 그럴거예요.
00:26:45	 
		 
00:26:45	He gave us a chance.
		윅은 우리에게 기회를 줬고 
00:26:46	 
		 
00:26:46	He taught us everything
		we needed to know,
		많은걸 가르쳐 줬어요.
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	and we are gonna prove
		to the world what he could do.
		우리가 세상에 윅을 증명할 거예요.
00:26:51	 
		 
00:26:51	Yeah, he treated us
		with love and respect.
		우리에게 사랑과 존경을 줬으니 
00:26:54	 
		 
00:26:54	We wanna honor him
		the same way.
		그리고 윅에게 보답해야죠.
00:26:56	 
		 
00:26:57	Mm.
		음. 
00:26:58	 
		 
00:27:00	Well, I particularly like this,
		uh... gold feathery number.
		난 특히 저게 좋더라구요. 금색 깃털 붙은거.
00:27:06	 
		 
00:27:06	It's just so, uh...
		이건 참.. 그.. 
00:27:07	 
		 
00:27:07	Well, it's an event.
		눈을 사로잡아요.
00:27:10	 
		 
00:27:10	Uh, where'd you get
		all these gold feathers?
		이런 깃털은 어디서 났어요?
00:27:12	 
		 
00:27:12	We dyed them.
		염색했죠.
00:27:14	 
		 
00:27:14	Combination of henna
		and iron oxide or something.
		헤나랑 산화철이랑 등등 섞어서. 
00:27:18	 
		 
00:27:18	Tristan was gonna model it
		트리스탄이 걸치고 
00:27:19	 
		 
00:27:19	and Wyck was gonna
		close the show with it.
		쇼의 대미를 장식할 옷이에요.
00:27:22	 
		 
00:27:22	Do you have any more
		of those feathers?
		깃털 좀 더 있어요?
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:25	I guess so... if you want.
		아마도요. 
00:27:28	 
		 
00:27:33	Thank you.
		감사합니다.
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:36	Bye.
		그럼.
00:27:38	 
		 
00:27:41	Why the long faces?
		왜 이렇게들 의기소침해 있어? 
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:43	You see those two over there
		talking to Wainright?
		웨인라이트랑 얘기하는 저 둘 보여?
00:27:44	 
		 
00:27:44	The one with the red tie
		looks like state department.
		붉은 타이는 국무부에서 온 것 같군. 
00:27:47	 
		 
00:27:47	He is.
		맞습니다. 
00:27:48	 
		 
00:27:48	The other one's
		from the Chinese embassy.
		다른 하나는 중국 대사관에서 왔어. 
00:27:50	 
		 
00:27:50	Apparently the three
		that were intimidating Liu
		리우를 협박하던 삼인조 
00:27:53	 
		 
00:27:53	have diplomatic immunity.
		외교면책을 누리는 것 같아. 
00:27:54	 
		 
00:27:54	Wainright's cutting 'em loose.
		웨인라이트가 놓아줄 건가 봅니다. 
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Well, I'd best go
		talk to them right away.
		그럼 지금 당장 가서 얘기해야겠는걸. 
00:27:58	 
		 
00:27:58	Agent Darcy. Hi.
		다아시 요원. 
00:28:00	 
		 
00:28:00	I need to talk
		to you, please. May I?
		얘기좀 하죠. 괜찮겠죠?
00:28:03	 
		 
00:28:03	Of course.
		물론이죠.
00:28:05	 
		 
00:28:05	Is there somewhere
		we can talk?
		얘기할 만한 장소가 있나요?
00:28:07	 
		 
00:28:07	Yeah. I just need
		to do one thing.
		한가지만 처리하구요.
00:28:08	 
		 
00:28:08	Uh, where are those gangsters?
		갱단원들이 어디 있다고?
00:28:10	 
		 
00:28:10	All three of them
		are in the interrogation room
		변호사랑 같이 
00:28:11	 
		 
00:28:11	with their lawyer.
		심문실에요.
00:28:12	 
		 
00:28:12	- Come on.
		- Thanks.
		- 가시죠.
		- 감사합니다.
00:28:15	 
		 
00:28:20	This won't take a minute.
		금방 끝납니다.
00:28:22	 
		 
00:28:41	Thank you.
		감사합니다.
00:28:42	 
		 
00:28:46	What was that all about?
		방금 그게 뭐였죠?
00:28:48	 
		 
00:28:48	Just trying to solve a murder.
		살인 사건을 해결하려는 중이죠.
00:28:50	 
		 
00:28:50	- Tea?
		- No, thank you.
		- 차라도?
		- 괜찮아요.
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	I just have
		a couple of questions
		좀 분명히 해주셔야 할 
00:28:53	 
		 
00:28:53	I need you to clarify for me.
		몇가지 사안이 있네요.
00:28:56	 
		 
00:28:56	Oh. Fire away.
		말씀하세요.
00:28:58	 
		 
00:29:00	Rosalind Harker.
		로잘린드 하커. 
00:29:04	 
		 
00:29:04	You met with her
		a couple of years ago
		레드존을 추적하면서 
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	when you were
		tracking Red John?
		몇년 전 만난 적이 있죠?
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:08	Uh, yes.
		네. 
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:10	That's correct.
		그렇습니다.
00:29:12	 
		 
00:29:12	Why do you ask?
		그건 왜?
00:29:14	 
		 
00:29:14	She was the lover of a man
		by the name of--
		하커양은 연인 관계였죠. 그..
00:29:16	 
		 
00:29:16	Roy Taglioferro?
		로이 탈리아페로와?
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:18	Right. Who was really
		Red John?
		즉 레드존과 말이죠.
00:29:20	 
		 
00:29:20	Yes.
		네. 
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	But you took Rosalind
		to the morgue
		하커양을 시체보관소에 데려가 
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:24	to look at the body
		of Timothy Carter--
		티모시 카터의 시신을 확인시켰는데 
00:29:26	 
		 
00:29:26	Timothy Carter, who you killed
		because @@/he@@\ was Red John.
		즉 당신이 죽인 레드존 말이에요.
00:29:28	 
		 
00:29:28	Yes.
		네. 
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:32	Rosalind told you
		that Timothy Carter
		로잘린드는 티모시 카터가 
00:29:34	 
		 
00:29:34	wasn't Taglioferro,
		didn't she?
		탈리아페로가 아니라고 했습니다. 그랬죠?
00:29:36	 
		 
00:29:36	Yes. I was hoping
		for confirmation from her.
		하커양으로부터 확인받길 바랐습니다. 
00:29:39	 
		 
00:29:39	She's hardly
		a rock-solid witness.
		그런데 썩 좋은 증인은 되지 못했어요.
00:29:42	 
		 
00:29:42	It had been many years
		since her last contact
		탈리아페로와 마지막으로 접촉한지 
00:29:44	 
		 
00:29:44	with Mr. Taglioferro.
		수년이 흘렀고 
00:29:45	 
		 
00:29:45	She's kind of a lonely soul.
		또 쓸쓸하게 사는 분이다보니 
00:29:48	 
		 
00:29:48	I think she'd rather believe
		차라리 탈리아페로가 어디 먼곳에 
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:50	he was still out there
		alive somewhere.
		살아있었으면 하고 바라는 것 같습니다. 
00:29:52	 
		 
00:29:52	Hmm.
		흠.
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:55	I suppose you're right.
		일리 있네요.
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	It was Red John
		that I killed.
		내가 죽인게 레드존입니다.
00:29:59	 
		 
00:30:00	I sure hope so.
		그러길 바랍니다. 
00:30:02	 
		 
00:30:07	Thanks, Patrick.
		고마워요, 패트릭. 
00:30:08	 
		 
00:30:08	Pleasure.
		언제든 부탁하세요.
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:27	I checked out the Chinese thugs.
		They're clean.
		중국 사람들 싹 다 훑어봤는데 깨끗해. 
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	Let's go to the hotel,
		shall we?
		호텔 가자. 괜찮아? 
00:30:30	 
		 
00:30:30	Uh, aside from the kids
		helping Theissens,
		테시스 어시 애들 빼고는 
00:30:33	 
		 
00:30:33	only the killer
		knows what this is.
		이게 뭔지 아는건 범인 뿐이거든. 
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:34	I'll tell Rigsby and Van Pelt.
		릭스비와 반펠트에게 말해두죠.
00:30:37	 
		 
00:30:40	Tell me what happened
		with Darcy.
		다아시랑 무슨 일이었는지 말해. 
00:30:42	 
		 
00:30:42	I know it was something.
		뭔가 있었지. 
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	Well, it's nothing important.
		중요한거 아니야.
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:46	It's bad news.
		안 좋은 소식이잖아. 
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:48	You've got a bad news expression
		on your face.
		얼굴에 '안 좋은 소식 경보'라고 써붙여 놨잖아.
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:52	Darcy talked
		to Rosalind Harker.
		다아시가 로잘린드 하커랑 만났대. 
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	She knows Timothy Carter
		wasn't Red John.
		티모시 카터가 레드존이 아닌걸 알겠군. 
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	Well, she might suspect,
		but she doesn't know.
		의심은 해보겠지만 아직 모르는 상태야.
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:00	And you're not
		gonna tell her?
		너는 끝까지 입다물거고?
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	Well, of course not.
		Why stir up trouble?
		그래야지, 왜 긁어 부스럼을 만들어?
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:07	Hmm?
		흠?
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:10	Let's go.
		갑시다.
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:20	Hey, we're headed over
		to the hotel.
		호텔로 가는데 말야, 
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:22	You on top
		of everything here?
		남는거야?
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	Hmm?
		음?
00:31:25	 
		 
00:31:25	Oh, uh, yeah.
		Uh, sure.
		아, 그러려고. 
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:30	Wayne?
		You're reading a baby book.
		웨인? 육아책을 보고 있잖아.
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	Um, yeah, I am.
		아, 그래. 
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	Um, why?
		그...왜?
00:31:38	 
		 
00:31:38	I...
		나...
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	Yes.
		그래. 
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:43	I'm pregnant.
		나 임신했어.
00:31:45	 
		 
00:31:46	Sarah's pregnant.
		..사라가.
00:31:47	 
		 
00:31:49	- I'm having a baby.
		- Oh, my God.
		- 나 애를 가지게 됐어.
		- 이럴수가.
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	Yikes.
		이럴수가.
00:31:53	 
		 
00:31:53	I mean--sorry.
		...미안.
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:54	It surprised me.
		Congratulations.
		놀래서 그랬어. 축하한다. 
00:31:57	 
		 
00:31:57	No, it was a surprise
		to me, too.
		나도 놀랐는걸 뭐. 
00:32:00	 
		 
00:32:00	Still is, actually.
		실은 아직 놀라는 중이야.
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	Hard even for me
		to believe sometimes.
		어떨땐 아직 믿겨지지도 않아.
00:32:05	 
		 
00:32:05	Are you okay?
		괜찮아?
00:32:07	 
		 
00:32:07	Yeah. Oh, I'm--
		babies are good, right?
		그럼, 애는 좋은거잖아?
00:32:11	 
		 
00:32:12	Always wanted to have kids.
		언제나 아빠가 되고 싶었어.
00:32:13	 
		 
00:32:13	Just a little earlier
		than I expected.
		내 예상보다 좀 일러서 그렇지. 
00:32:18	 
		 
00:32:18	So are you and Sarah
		getting married?
		그럼 사라와 결혼하는 거야?
00:32:19	 
		 
00:32:19	Oh, no. No.
		Nothing like that.
		아니, 그런 건 아니고.
00:32:21	 
		 
00:32:21	Don't wanna rush
		into anything, right?
		뭐든 서둘고 싶지 않아.
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:26	Haven't even been dating
		that long.
		그 정도로 오래 사귄것도 아니고.
00:32:29	 
		 
00:32:31	If... you need anything,
		you can ask.
		아무튼 부탁할게 있거든 언제든지 말해.
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	You know that, right?
		알겠지?
00:32:36	 
		 
00:32:36	Yeah.
		You should get going, though.
		그래, 이만 가봐야지 너. 
00:32:40	 
		 
00:32:40	Yeah.
		응.
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:44	Uh, Wayne...
		웨인, 
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	The kid's lucky.
		You're gonna make a great dad.
		그 애가 운이 좋다. 넌 좋은 아빠 될거야. 
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	Yeah? You think?
		그래?
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	Yeah. I know it.
		그럼. 물론이지. 
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	Bye.
		그럼.
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:59	Thanks.
		고맙다.
00:33:01	 
		 
00:33:11	Mr. Duval. Hi.
		드발씨. 
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:13	We just need to clear
		a few things up.
		몇가지 분명히 하고 지나가겠습니다.
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	This is approaching harassment.
		갑자기 찾아와 무슨 행패요.
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:17	We have spoken
		to our lawyers.
		변호사에게 얘기하겠어요.
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:19	Uh, come with me, please.
		이쪽으로 와 보세요.
00:33:20	 
		 
00:33:20	Why?
		왜요?
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	I have a question
		I'd like to ask you.
		물어볼 게 있습니다.
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	What kind of question?
		무슨?
00:33:24	 
		 
00:33:24	Well, it's the kind of question
		that could clear your name
		당신을 용의자선상에서 지우거나 
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:26	or prove your guilt.
		But, uh, first of all,
		범인으로 특정하거나 할 수 있는 질문입니다.
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	I'd like you to
		empty your pockets, please.
		그 전에 주머니부터 비워주세요.
00:33:33	 
		 
00:33:33	This is ridiculous.
		무슨 이런 경우가.
00:33:35	 
		 
00:33:35	Please.
		부탁합니다.
00:33:36	 
		 
00:33:46	What is this?
		이게 뭐야?
00:33:48	 
		 
00:33:50	What does it look like?
		뭐처럼 보이시죠?
00:33:52	 
		 
00:33:52	Well, it's obviously a feather.
		It's not mine.
		깃털같소만. 내 것이 아니오.
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:57	Where did this come from?
		이게 어디서 난 거요?
00:33:59	 
		 
00:33:59	Lisbon,
		our work here is done.
		리스본, 우리 볼일은 끝났어.
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	Thank you for your time,
		Mr. Duval. Mrs. Duval.
		시간 내주셔서 감사합니다, 두분. 
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:20	Hey, Junior.
		주니어.
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	Hey. What's up?
		How's your investigation going?
		어때요, 수사는?
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:24	Well, that's why we're here.
		I found the killer.
		여기 온게 그 때문이에요. 범인을 찾았습니다.
00:34:27	 
		 
00:34:27	- Really?
		- Mm-hmm.
		- 정말요?
		- 으흠.
00:34:29	 
		 
00:34:29	Well, who is it?
		What happened?
		누구였어요? 어떻게 된거고?
00:34:31	 
		 
00:34:32	The clue was right
		in front of my eyes.
		단서는 바로 눈 앞에 있었습니다.
00:34:35	 
		 
00:34:35	It's all here
		in this magazine.
		이 잡지에 전부 있었어요.
00:34:38	 
		 
00:34:38	Whoa.
		앗.
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	That's... pretty cool.
		Is it yours?
		이것 근사한데, 그쪽 겁니까?
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:45	Hmm.
		흠. 
00:34:48	 
		 
00:34:48	Hey, what article
		am I supposed to be reading?
		그래서 무슨 기사를 읽으면 돼요?
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	Thank you for your time,
		Mr. Acosta. We'll stay in touch.
		감사합니다, 아코스타씨. 연락 드리죠.
00:34:54	 
		 
00:34:58	Yes. I love that.
		그래, 좋아. 
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:02	Don't move a muscle.
		근육 움직이지 마. 
00:35:03	 
		 
00:35:06	Yes?
		네? 
00:35:07	 
		 
00:35:07	Hello.
		안녕하세요.
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:08	Hi. I'm agent Teresa Lisbon.
		테레사 리스본 요원입니다. 
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:11	You've already met
		Patrick Jane, right?
		패트릭 제인씨는 구면이죠?
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	Hey.
		안녕하세요.
00:35:14	 
		 
00:35:14	- Hi.
		- Hi.
		안녕하세요. 
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	What do you want?
		You come to hassle me
		원하는게 뭡니까? 
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:17	about Wyck Theissens' death
		some more, have you?
		윅 테시스 때문에 날 더 들볶으려구요?
00:35:19	 
		 
00:35:19	Not really. One or two more
		things falling into place,
		그다지요. 한두가지만 맞춰지면 
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:22	and the killer
		shall be revealed.
		범인은 자연히 나타날 겁니다. 
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:25	I'll get it.
		내가 나가지.
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:27	So why have you come here?
		그럼 여긴 왜 오셨죠?
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:30	I need your help.
		도움이 필요해서요. 
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:35	Hey. I didn't order
		room service.
		룸서비스 시킨 적 없는데. 
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:38	Where did that come from?
		이게 어디서 온 거야?
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	Oh, all I know
		is that I'm starving.
		마침 배고팠는데. 
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	Do you think I could, uh,
		have something from here?
		좀 집어먹어도 되죠?
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:50	What the hell is that?
		이게 대체 뭐야? 
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	It means nothing to you?
		아무것도 느껴지는게 없습니까? 
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	Why would it?
