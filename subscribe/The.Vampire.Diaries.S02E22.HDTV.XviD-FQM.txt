00:00:00	You must be Elena.
		네가 엘레나구나.
00:00:00	 
		 
00:00:01	How do we look exactly alike?
		어떻게 똑같이 생긴거지?
00:00:02	 
		 
00:00:02	You're a Petrova doppelganger.
		넌 페트로바 도플갱어야
00:00:03	 
		 
00:00:03	You're the key
		to breaking the curse.
		저주를 깨는 열쇠지
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	Klaus is a vampire born
		from a werewolf bloodline.
		클라우스는 늑대인간 혈통에서
		태어난 뱀파이어야
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	The curse has kept his werewolf
		aspect from manifesting.
		저주가 늑대인간의 면을
		억제하고 있었던 거지
00:00:10	 
		 
00:00:10	He'll be vulnerable
		during the transformation.
		변이 중에
		약해질 거야
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	That's when Bonnie comes in.
		그때 보니가
		오는 거지
00:00:13	 
		 
00:00:13	If she can deliver
		him to the brink of death,
		보니가 죽기 직전의
		상태로 만들어 놓으면
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	I'll finish the job myself.
		내 스스로 끝낼 거야
00:00:16	 
		 
00:00:16	I had a family.
		나도 가족이 있었지
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	Klaus hunted them
		down one by one.
		클라우스는 한 명씩
		찾아내서
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	He scattered them
		across the seas,
		시체를 찾을 수 없도록
00:00:20	 
		 
00:00:20	where their bodies
		could not be found.
		바다에 던져버렸어
00:00:22	 
		 
00:00:22	I didn't bury them at sea.
		바다에 묻지 않았어
00:00:23	 
		 
00:00:24	Their bodies are safe.
		시체는 안전해
00:00:25	 
		 
00:00:25	If you kill me,
		you'll never find them.
		날 죽이면
		다시는 못 볼거야
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	No!
		안돼!
00:00:29	 
		 
00:00:29	Who's going to save your life
		네가 결정을
		내리는 동안
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	while you're out
		making decisions?
		네 목숨은
		누가 지켜주지?
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	I don't want to be saved.
		구원받고 싶지
		않다고요
00:00:33	 
		 
00:00:33	There is another way.
		다른 방법도 있지
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	What are you... Damon, no.
		뭐 하는...
		데이먼, 안돼요
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:36	I fed her my blood.
		내 피를 줬어
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	She'll come back a vampire.
		뱀파이어가 될 거야
00:00:38	 
		 
00:00:38	How could you take that
		choice away from her?
		어떻게 그런 결정권을
		앗아갈 수가 있어?
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	She'll never forgive you.
		엘레나는 절대로
		널 용서하지 않을거야
00:00:41	 
		 
00:00:41	Tyler Lockwood bit me.
		타일러가 날 물었어
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	A werewolf bite
		can kill a vampire.
		뱀파이어는 늑대인간에게
		물리면 죽어
00:00:44	 
		 
00:01:23	That'll get easier.
		나중엔 괜찮아질 거야
00:01:26	 
		 
00:01:26	But you knew that.
		하지만 너도
		알고 있었잖아
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	What do you want?
		원하는 게 뭐에요?
00:01:29	 
		 
00:01:30	I want to apologize.
		사과하고 싶어
00:01:31	 
		 
00:01:31	Damon.
		데이먼
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	Please.
		제발
00:01:33	 
		 
00:01:34	Elena, feeding you my
		blood, I was wrong.
		엘레나, 피를 먹인 건
		내가 잘못했어
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:38	Yes, you were.
		네, 그렇죠
00:01:39	 
		 
00:01:40	And I know I don't deserve
		your forgiveness, but...
		그리고 용서받을 자격이
		없는 것도 알지만
00:01:43	 
		 
00:01:45	I need it.
		용서받고 싶어
00:01:46	 
		 
00:01:48	And I need some time,
		저도 시간이 필요해요
00:01:51	 
		 
00:01:51	maybe a lot of time.
		많은 시간이요
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:54	True. Of course.
		그렇지, 그럼
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:59	Take all the time you need.
		천천히 해

00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:39	You're not doing this.
		이러지 마
00:03:40	 
		 
00:03:41	Just did.
		벌써 한 걸
00:03:42	 
		 
00:03:44	You know what happened

		로즈가 어떻게 됐는지
		너도 알잖아, 스테판
00:03:46	 
		 
00:03:46	I don't care.
		상관없어
00:03:47	 
		 
00:03:51	You're not dying today.
		오늘은 아냐
00:03:53	 
		 
00:03:54	What's the plan, Superman?
		계획이 뭐야, 슈퍼맨?
00:03:57	 
		 
00:03:58	I'm gonna find
		a way out of this.
		방법을 찾아낼 거야
00:03:59	 
		 
00:03:59	Oh, right.
		오, 그렇지
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:00	A miracle cure.
		기적의 치유
00:04:02	 
		 
00:04:02	Good luck with that one.
		잘 해보라고
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	I got Bonnie looking
		for something, anything.
		보니가 방법을
		찾아주기로 했어
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:07	Always the hero, Stefan.
		언제나 영웅이지, 스테판
00:04:09	 
		 
00:04:10	Just tell me good-bye,
		get it over with.
		작별인사나 해주고
		잊어버려
00:04:13	 
		 
00:04:19	Lie still.
		가만히 누워있어
00:04:21	 
		 
00:04:21	Conserve your strength.
		힘을 아껴둬
00:04:22	 
		 
00:04:40	You've been busy.
		좀 바빴더군
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:45	That was amazing.
		정말 놀라웠어
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:49	How long has it been?
		시간이 얼마나 됐지?
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	Almost 2 days.
		거의 이틀 정도
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:55	Full moon came and went.
		You remained a wolf.
		보름달이 떴다 사라졌어
		넌 계속 늑대 상태였고
00:04:58	 
		 
00:04:58	I can change at will, then.
		그럼 내 의지대로
		변할 수 있단거군
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	It's good to know.
		알게 돼서 기쁜걸
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	I remember every single kill.
		누굴 죽였는지
		전부 기억이 나
00:05:06	 
		 
00:05:07	Yes, I've been cleaning up your
		little mess along the way.
		그래, 내가 네
		뒷처리 하고 다녔어
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	Just like old times, brother.
		옛날처럼 말야, 동생
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	You've had your fun.
		I believe we have a bargain.
		넌 너대로 재미 봤고
		우리 거래가 있는데 말야
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	That's right.
		그렇지
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:16	Now, what was it again?
		그게 뭐였더라?
00:05:18	 
		 
00:05:18	Oh, yeah. Wait.
		I remember. That's it.
		오, 그래. 기다려 봐
		기억나, 바로 그거지
00:05:21	 
		 
00:05:21	You wish to be reunited
		with our family.
		우리 가족과 다시
		만났으면 하는 거지
00:05:24	 
		 
00:05:24	You gave me your word, Niklaus.
		약속했잖아, 니클라우스
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	What kind of brother
		would break his bond?
		도대체 세상에 어떤 형이
		형제의 유대를 저버리겠어?
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	Even though you did
		try to kill me.
		네가 날 죽이려
		했지만 말야
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:33	I could have.
		죽일 수 있었어
00:05:35	 
		 
00:05:35	But I didn't.
		그러지 않은 거지
00:05:38	 
		 
00:05:40	And now no one can,
		이제 아무도
		그럴 수 없어
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	not even you.
		너라도 말야
00:05:44	 
		 
00:05:46	Relax, Elijah.
		긴장 풀어, 일라이자
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	All is forgiven.
		모두 용서했어
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:51	Where are they?
		모두는 어딨지?
00:05:53	 
		 
00:05:56	You need to lighten up.
		긴장 풀으라니까
00:05:58	 
		 
00:05:58	I'll bring you to them
		soon enough.
		곧 데려올게
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:14	Sorry, you've reached somebody
		who's currently not operating.
		죄송한데 제가 지금
		정신줄을 놓았거든요?
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	I need your help.
		도움이 필요해요
00:06:19	 
		 
00:06:19	Well, you must have me
		confused with somebody else.
		그럼 네가 전화를
		잘못 걸었나 보다
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	You see,
		I'm not allowed to help,
		있지, 난
		아무도 못 도와
00:06:23	 
		 
00:06:23	just idly sit by while my girlfriend
		gets sacrificed on an altar of blood.
		내 여자친구가 피의 재단에
		희생될 때 가만히 앉아 있었거든
00:06:26	 
		 
00:06:26	Damon's dying.
		형이 죽어가요
00:06:27	 
		 
00:06:29	- What?
		- Tyler Lockwood bit him.
		- 뭐라고?
		- 타일러한테 물렸어요
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	We don't have much time.
		시간이 많지 않아요
00:06:31	 
		 
00:06:35	What do you need?
		필요한 게 뭐야?
00:06:37	 
		 
00:06:47	You brought me to see
		a girl movie.
		여자들이 보는 영화나
		보자고 데려온 거야?
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:50	We had to get out
		of the house, Jer.
		밖에 나왔어야
		했잖아, 제레미
00:06:52	 
		 
00:06:52	This is our 3-hour
		distraction from reality.
		현실로부터의
		3시간 동안의 도피야
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	Is that what we're doing? Pretending
		like our lives aren't screwed?
		지금 그거 하려는 거야? 우리
		삶이 구리지 않은 척 하는 거?
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:58	We need to do this, ok?
		해야만 해, 응?
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:01	Breathe, eat, sleep,
		숨 쉬고, 먹고, 자고
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:03	wake up, and do it
		all over again
		일어나서
		계속 반복하는 거
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	until one day, it's just
		not as hard anymore.
		더는 힘들지
		않을 때까지
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:11	Hey! There you guys are.
		안녕! 거기 있었구나
00:07:14	 
		 
00:07:15	Who's hungry?
		배고픈 사람?
00:07:16	 
		 
00:07:16	Are we really doing this?
		정말 이러기야?
00:07:18	 
		 
00:07:18	Yes, we are really doing this.
		응, 그럼
00:07:20	 
		 
00:07:20	We are going to take
		a page from Scarlett.
		오늘은 스칼렛
		흉내를 내는 거야
		('바람과 함께 사라지다'의 후속편)
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	We made it through the war.
		우린 전쟁을 이겨낸 거야
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	I know you guys
		went through hell,
		너희는 온갖 일을
		다 겪었지
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:27	and my mom knows
		I am a vampire,
		그리고 우리 엄마는
		내 정체를 알고 있고
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	so basically it's like
		Atlanta has burned.
		그러니까 애틀랜타가
		불타버린 거랑 비슷한 거야
		(1864년 남북 전쟁 때 애틀랜타가 불탐)
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	And yet,
		in spite of everything,
		하지만 이런
		상황에도 개의치 않고
00:07:35	 
		 
00:07:35	we persevere.
		우린 나아가는 거야
00:07:36	 
		 
00:07:41	All right.
		알았어
00:07:43	 
		 
00:07:43	What are we eating?
		먹을 거 뭐 있어?
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	Something good.
		좋은 거
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:57	I'm not sure
		this is going to work.
		이게 통할지
		잘 모르겠어
00:07:59	 
		 
00:07:59	You've done a s챕ance
		before, right?
		강령술은 한번 해 봤잖아?
		(죽은 이와 대화하는 주술)
00:08:02

		에밀리 베넷과 닿았지
00:08:03

		know how to help Damon.
		마녀 중 누군가는 형을
		도울 방법을 알 거야
00:08:06

00:08:53	or are you just saying
		no because it's Damon?
		아니면 데이먼 일이라서
		그냥 안됀다고 하는 거야?
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	Perhaps it is his time to die.
		아마 죽을 때가 된 걸지도
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:59	No.
		아니
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	That's not balance.

00:09:54	 
		 
00:09:54	Better, thank goodness.
		좀 나아요, 다행히도요
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	That was a terrible fall.
		정말 심하게 떨어졌잖아요
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	Shouldn't you be home resting?
		쉬어야 하지 않아요?
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	I've been resting,
		많이 쉬었어요
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	and now I'm ready
		to get back to work.
		이제 일할 준비가 됐어요
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	I need you to update me on where
		we are with the vampire situation.
		뱀파이어 상황이 어떻게
		되어가고 있는지 알려줘요
00:10:03	 
		 
00:10:03	Well, there have been
		some developments,
		진전이 좀 있었지만
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:05	but I'm handling it.
		제가 처리하고 있어요
00:10:07	 
		 
00:10:07	Are you?
		정말요?
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	Because I left you in charge
		of this town's safety,
		제가 당신한테 이 마을의
		안전을 맡겼잖아요
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	and lately I'm not
		seeing any results.
		근데 최근들어
		아무런 결과도 없네요
00:10:12	 
		 
00:10:12	I said I'm handling it.
		처리하고 있댔잖아요
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	Then see that you do, Sheriff,
		그럼 똑바로 하세요, 보안관님
00:10:15	 
		 
00:10:15	because if you can't,
		I'll find someone who will.
		당신이 못하면, 할 수 있는
		사람을 찾을 거거든요
00:10:18	 
		 
00:10:21	Hey.
		안녕
00:10:22	 
		 
00:10:22	Hey.
		안녕
00:10:23	 
		 
00:10:24	Look who couldn't
		resist an epic romance.
		로맨스를 거부하기가
		힘들었나 보구나
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	Will you come
		take a walk with me?
		나랑 좀 걸을래?
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	You're breaking
		the rules, you know.
		약속을 깨고 있잖아
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:32	Movie night's supposed
		to be a distraction.
		오늘은 머리를 
		식히기로 했잖아
00:10:34	 
		 
00:10:34	Tomorrow we can return to our
		regularly scheduled drama.
		내일 우리의 일상으로
		돌아가는 거고
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:37	I know. I wish this could
		wait, but it can't.
		알아. 기다릴 수 있는 거면
		좋겠지만, 그렇지가 않아
00:10:40	 
		 
00:10:41	Listen, um, the other night
		when Damon was helping Tyler,
		있지, 형이 타일러를
		도와줬던 밤에
00:10:45	 
		 
00:10:45	something happened.
		일이 터졌어
00:10:46	 
		 
00:10:47	Tyler was starting
		to transform,
		타일러가 변이 중이었고
00:10:49	 
		 
00:10:49	and Damon was bitten.
		형이 물렸어
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:53	What?
		뭐라고?
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:55	Is it... is he gonna...
		그럼... 데이먼이...
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:57	Yeah.
		응
00:10:59	 
		 
00:11:01	Oh, my God.
		세상에
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:04	And he came to the
		house this morning
		오늘 아침에 데이먼이
		우리집에 왔었는데
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	and... and tried
		to apologize.
		사과를 하려고 했어
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	I practically slammed
		the door in his face.
		근데 난 면전에 대고
		문을 닫았고 말야
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	He told me not to tell you,
		but I figured if you
		형이 너한테 말하지 말라고
		했는데 네가 형한테
00:11:13	 
		 
00:11:13	wanted to talk to him,
		I... I wouldn't wait.
		얘기하고 싶으면 기다리지
		않는 게 좋을 것 같아서
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:16	Stefan...
		스테판
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	it's not over.
		아직 끝난 게 아냐
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	There might be a cure,
		치료법이 있을 거야
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	but I have to find Klaus
		to get it.
		하지만 알아내려면
		클라우스를 찾아야 해
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	No. He's gonna kill you.
		안돼, 널 죽일거야
00:11:25	 
		 
00:11:25	No, he had the chance
		to kill me, but he didn't.
		아니, 날 죽일 기회가 
		있었는데 그러지 않았어
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:28	Whatever Damon's done,
		whatever has led him here,
		형이 무슨 짓을 했던, 어떤 게
		형을 이렇게 만들었든 간에
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	I'm the one that made him become
		a vampire in the first place,
		애초에 형을 뱀파이어로 
		만든 건 바로 나야
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	so if there's
		a chance for a cure,
		그러니까 치료할
		방법이 있다면
00:11:39	 
		 
00:11:39	I owe it to him to find it.
		난 그걸 찾아줘야 해
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:45	Go talk to him.
		형한테 가봐
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:47	Just tell him that
		there's still hope.
		아직 희망이
		있다고 말해줘
00:11:49	 
		 
00:12:08	Mr. Salvatore,
		spying on a lady
		살바토어씨
		숙녀에게 곁눈 질 
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:10	is a sign of very poor manners.
		하는 건 좋은 
		매너가 아니에요
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:15	My apologies, miss Katherine.
		사과하죠, 캐서린 양
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:18	But since you are here,
		하지만 여기 왔으니
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	my corset strings
		seem to be knotted.
		코르셋 끈이
		꼬인 것 같아요
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	I wonder if you can undo them.
		좀 풀어줬으면 하는데
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	Of course.
		물론이죠
00:12:26	 
		 
00:12:38	Will you miss me while off
		defending the South?
		남쪽을 지키러 떠날 때
		날 그리워할 건가요?
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:41	I shall.
		기꺼이요
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	Then I hope
		you will hurry back.
		그럼 서두르는 게
		좋을 거에요
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:45	I fear I will be lonely
		with you away.
		당신이 없으면 외로움에
		두려울 것 같거든요
00:12:48	 
		 
00:12:48	I would think Stefan
		should be company enough.
		스테판이 있으면
		충분할 것 같은데요
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:53	Is it so wrong for me
		to want you both?
		둘 다 원하는 게
		잘못된 건가요?
00:12:57	 
		 
00:12:57	Damon.
		데이먼
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:12:59	 
		 
00:12:59	Don't you see?
		아직 모르겠어요?
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:02	She was toying with you.
		그녀는 당신을 
		갖고 논 거에요
00:13:04	 
		 
00:13:04	All you had to do was
		say no, walk away.
		당신은 안됀다고 하고
		떠났어야 했어요
00:13:07	 
		 
00:13:07	You had a choice.
		선택권이 있었잖아요
00:13:09	 
		 
00:13:09	Promise me that you
		will return quickly.
		빨리 돌아올 거라고
		약속해 줘요
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	I promise.
		약속해요
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:33	Hello, Katherine.
		안녕, 캐서린
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	Two days, I've been waiting.
		이틀 동안이나 기다렸어
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	I'm supposed to be free
		of Klaus' compulsion by now.
		지금쯤이면 클라우스의
		주문에서 풀려났어야 한다고
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	He's supposed to be dead.
		클라우스는 죽었어야 하잖아
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	We ran into complications.
		일이 좀 꼬였어
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	Complications?
		꼬였다고?
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	Doesn't really matter.
		I just need to find him.
		그게 문제가 아냐
		클라우스를 찾아야 해
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:45	Do you have any idea
		where he might be?
		어디 있는지 알아?
00:13:46	 
		 
00:13:46	Shh.
		　
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:49	Klaus, you're back.
		클라우스, 돌아왔구나
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:53	Look who decided
		to come for a visit.
		누가 왔는지 보라고
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	You just keep popping
		up, don't you?
		계속 나타나는군, 안 그래?
00:13:59	 
		 
00:13:59	I need your help...
		당신 도움이 필요해
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	For my brother.
		우리 형을 위해
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	Well, whatever it is, he's
		gonna have to wait a tick.
		그게 뭐든 간에
		좀 기다려야 할 거야
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	You see, I have an
		obligation to my brother
		내 동생한테 할
		의무가 있거든
00:14:09	 
		 
00:14:09	that requires my
		immediate attention.
		내 즉각적인 주의를
		필요로 하지
00:14:11	 
		 
00:14:14	You understand how
		important family is,
		가족이 얼마나 
		중요한지 알고 있다면
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	or you wouldn't be here.
		여길 오지 말았어야지
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:18	My brother gave me
		his word that he
		내 형이 가족과
		다시 만나게 해
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:20	would reunite me with my own.
		줄 거라고 약속했거든
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	And so I shall.
		물론 그래야지
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	Raah!
		　
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:31	Shh.
		　
00:14:34	 
		 
00:14:45	Now, what am I
		gonna do with you?
		자, 이제 널
		어떻게 할까?
00:14:50	 
		 
00:15:02	Do you feel that?
		느껴지나?
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	It's scraping
		against your heart.
		네 심장을
		긁어내고 있어
00:15:06	 
		 
00:15:06	The slightest little movement,
		조금만 움직여도
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:09	and you're dead.
		넌 죽은 거야
00:15:10	 
		 
00:15:13	He's just trying
		to help his brother.
		그냥 자기 형을
		도우려고 하는 거잖아
00:15:15	 
		 
00:15:15	The witches said
		you had a cure.
		마녀들이 네가
		치료법을 알 거라 했어
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:18	Make me a deal.
		Just give me the cure,
		거래를 하자
		치료법을 알려줘
00:15:20	 
		 
00:15:20	and I'll do whatever you want.
		그럼 뭐든지 할게
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:31	Trouble is I don't know
		if you'd be any good to me
		문제는 네가 나한테
		도움이 될 거냐 라는 거지
00:15:34	 
		 
00:15:34	the way you are now.
		지금 그 상태로는 말야
00:15:36	 
		 
00:15:36	You are just shy of useless.
		넌 쓸모없어
00:15:41	 
		 
00:15:47	Well, that looks bad.
		안좋아 보이네
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	It feels worse.
		그것보다 심해
00:15:51	 
		 
00:15:52	My subconscious
		is haunting me, Rick.
		환영이 사라지지가 않아, 릭
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:57	Please tell me you have
		something for that. Heh.
		제발 방법이 있다고 해줘
00:16:00	 
		 
00:16:00	Double shot.
		두 잔이야
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:04	That's good.
		그거 좋군
00:16:06	 
		 
00:16:10	Oh, good.
		　
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:16	So my brother sent you
		for suicide watch?
		내 동생이 나
		죽는거 보라고 보냈어?
00:16:18	 
		 
00:16:18	He's just trying to help.
		스테판은 그냥
		도우려 하는 거야
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:21	He's doing what he always does,
		항상 그러시지
00:16:23	 
		 
00:16:24	trying to right
		the wrongs of the past.
		과거의 잘못을
		바로잡으려 하지
00:16:26	 
		 
00:16:26	Aah!
		　
00:16:27	 
		 
00:16:30	You should want me dead.
		내가 죽었으면 좋겠지
00:16:32	 
		 
00:16:32	I'm the reason
		Jenna got killed.
		나 때문에 
		제나가 죽었으니
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:36	I don't blame you for Jenna.
		네 탓이 아냐
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	Oh, sure you do.
		오, 그렇고 말고
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:41	Let's not forget I turned
		your wife into a vampire.
		네 아내를 내가 뱀파이어로
		만든 걸 잊지 말라고
00:16:43	 
		 
00:16:44	You must really
		hate me for that one.
		당연히 날 미워해야지
00:16:47	 
		 
00:16:47	Ok, give me your glass.
		Neither one of us
		알았어, 잔이나 이리 줘
		우리 둘 다
00:16:49	 
		 
00:16:49	is drunk enough
		for this conversation.
		이런 얘기 하려면
		더 마셔야 해
00:16:50	 
		 
00:16:58	Kill me.
		날 죽여줘
00:16:59	 
		 
00:17:00	Please.
		제발
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:02	Screw you.
		엿이나 먹어
00:17:04	 
		 
00:17:06	Aah.
		　
00:17:07	 
		 
00:17:07	No.
		안돼
00:17:10	 
		 
00:17:13	Elena?
		엘레나?
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:16	Elena's not here, Damon.
		엘레나는 여기 없어, 데이먼
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:36	Don't make a sound.
		소리내지 마
00:17:38	 
		 
00:17:40	I need blood.
		피가 필요해
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:43	I need blood.
		피가 필요해
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:51	Where's Damon?
		데이먼은 어딨어?
00:17:53	 
		 
00:17:54	You know, now's not a good
		time, Sheriff. Trust me.
		지금은 때가 아니에요

		수십년간 계속

00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	When he was off,

		그가 방황할 땐

00:19:22

		1917년, 그는 몬테레이로 갔지
		(미국 캘리포니아주 서부의 도시)
00:19:25	 
		 
00:19:26	and wiped out an entire

		그리곤 이주자들이 사는
		마을을 쓸어버렸어
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:30	A true ripper.
		진정한 살인마였지
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:36	Sound familiar?
		너한테도 익숙한 이야긴가?
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:40	I haven't been that way
		in a very long time.
		오래동안 그렇게
		지내지 않았어
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	Well, that's the vampire
		I can make a deal with.
		난 그런 뱀파이어와만
		거래를 해
00:19:46	 
		 
00:19:46	That is the kind of talent that I
		can use when I leave this town.
		그게 바로 내가 이 마을을
		떠날 때 필요한 재능이지
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:54	Katerina, come here.
		카트리나, 이리 와
00:19:57	 
		 
00:20:04	Aah! Aah!
		　
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	No.
		안돼
00:20:08	 
		 
00:20:08	No... No.

00:20:39	Your blood is the cure.

00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Ok. Let's get you

00:21:23	 
		 
00:21:29	Where's Damon?
		데이먼은 어딨어요?
00:21:30	 
		 
00:21:30	What did you do to him?
		무슨 짓을 한 거에요?
00:21:31	 
		 
00:21:31	Why do you even care?
		왜 신경을 쓰는 거야?
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	You know what they are,
		what they do.
		그들의 정체와 어떤
		짓을 하는지 알잖아
00:21:35	 
		 
00:21:35	Look, I understand why you
		hate them, but you're wrong.
		뱀파이어를 증오하는 건
		이해해요, 하지만 틀렸어요
00:21:38	 
		 
00:21:38	They're murderers,

00:21:44	Wait. You've gotta

		잠깐만요
		저도 같이 갈래요
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	He's sick.
		He's... he's not himself.
		데이먼은 아파요
		지금 제정신이 아니라고요
00:21:50	 
		 
00:21:50	Keep her here.
		여기 두게
00:21:52	 
		 
00:21:57	Hey, it's me.
		I'm with Damon at The Grill.
		저에요. 데이먼이랑 
		같이 그릴에 있어요
00:22:00	 
		 
00:22:06	Oh, God.

		당장 의사를 불러
00:22:16

00:22:21	Mom, what did you do?
		엄마, 무슨 짓을 한 거야?
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:23	I was aiming for Damon.
		데이먼을 쏘려고 했어
00:22:24	 
		 
00:22:24	He still has his ring.
		반지를 끼고 있어
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:25	She's human. The ring
		won't work on him.
		보안관님은 인간이잖아
		반지는 안 통할거야
00:22:27	 
		 
00:22:27	- Caroline...
		- I got it.
		- 캐롤라인!
		- 나한테 맡겨
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:35	Come on, Jeremy.
		제발, 제레미
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	Just drink.
		Go on, Jeremy. Drink.
		그냥 마셔
		마시는 거야
00:22:38	 
		 
00:22:38	What are you doing?

00:22:40	I'm helping him.
		도와주고 있잖아
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	Jeremy, drink.
		제레미, 마셔
00:22:42	 
		 
00:22:42	Please.
		Please. Please.

00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:56	Bonnie, what's going on?

00:23:00	Oh, my God.

00:23:04	I know what I need to do.
		방법을 알아요
00:23:06	 
		 
00:23:06	I need you to grab him.
		제레미를 잡아줘요
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:08	T-take him with us.
		No, no, no, no.
		- 저랑 같이 가요
		- 안돼, 안돼
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:10	You can't move him.
		This is a crime scene.
		옮기면 안돼
		이건 범죄 상황이야
00:23:12	 
		 
00:23:12	Mom, you let them go.
		엄마, 보내줘요
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:16	All right, come here, buddy.
		좋아, 이리 온
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	I got you.
		I got you.
		괜찮아, 괜찮아
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:45	There it is.

00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:48	You want to save your brother?
		네 형을 구하고 싶어?
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	How 'bout
		a decade-long bender?
		10년 동안의
		타락(bender)은 어때?
		(술이나 마약 따위를 진탕 마시는 것)
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:57	And I have big plans for you
		널 위한 계획이 있어
00:23:59	 
		 
00:24:00	when we leave this town.
		우리가 마을을 떠날 때
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:03	I'm not like that anymore.
		난 더는 그런 
		짓은 하지 않아
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:06	Well, that's too bad.
		그것 참 안됐군
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:08	You would have made
		a hell of a wingman.
		내 대단한 조력자가

00:24:11	 
		 
00:24:13	Wait.
		기다려
00:24:15	 
		 
00:24:16	Now that's more like it.
		바로 그거야
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:19	I want you to join me
		for a drink.
		나랑 같이 마셔
00:24:22	 
		 
00:24:43	Finish it.
		다 마셔
00:24:45	 
		 
00:24:46	All of it.
		전부다
00:24:48	 
		 
00:24:52	You do everything I say,
		and I save your brother.
		넌 내가 시키는 대로 하고
		내가 네 형을 구하는 거야
00:24:55	 
		 
00:24:55	That's the deal.
		그게 거래지
00:24:56	 
		 
00:25:26	Again.
		다시
00:25:27	 
		 
00:25:47	Is this even possible?
		가능하기는 한거야?
00:25:49	 
		 
00:25:49	There's a spell for it
		그들이 힘을
		빌려준다면
00:25:50	 
		 
00:25:50	if they'll give me
		the power to use it.
		살릴 주문이 있어요

00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	Yeah, you were dead.
		그래, 넌 죽었었잖아
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	It'd be weird
		if you felt normal.
		정상이면 그게
		더 이상한 거지
00:31:21	 
		 
00:31:21	Bonnie, I, uh...
		I don't know how to thank you.
		보니, 어떻게 감사를
		해야할지 모르겠어
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	You can thank me tomorrow.
		내일 고마워하면 되지
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:27	And the day after that.
		그 다음날에도
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	And the day after that.
		또 그 다음날에도
00:31:32	 
		 
00:31:34	Good night, Jeremy.
		잘자, 제레미
00:31:35	 
		 
00:31:35	Good night.
		잘자
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:43	Hey, bud.
		제레미
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:46	I've gotta take off.
		가야되
00:31:48	 
		 
00:31:48	Need anything?
		필요한 거 있니?
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	Uh, no, no.
		어, 아뇨
00:31:51	 
		 
00:31:51	I think I'm good.
		괜찮아요
00:31:52	 
		 
00:31:58	You know, uh,
		on second thought,
		음, 다시 생각해보니
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:02	I might just crash here.
		Is that cool?
		여기서 자고 가야겠어
		그래도 되지?
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	Yeah, yeah.
		Sure. Whatever.
		네, 네
		그럼요
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:06	All right.
		　
00:32:08	 
		 
00:32:08	Alaric, um...
		알라릭, 음...
00:32:10	 
		 
00:32:12	Thank you for everything.
		정말로 고마워요
00:32:14	 
		 
00:32:14	Ah, you can
		thank me tomorrow...
		내일 고마워하면 되지
00:32:17	 
		 
00:32:17	And the day after that,
		the day after that.
		그 다음날에도
		또 그 다음날에도
00:32:20	 
		 
00:32:20	Dude, come on!
		I knew you were listening.
		아, 듣고 있었던 거
		다 알아요
00:32:22	 
		 
00:32:22	And the day after that.
		또 그 다음날에도
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:28	Elena.
		엘레나
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	It's ok, Damon.
		I'm right here.
		괜찮아요, 데이먼
		바로 여기 있어요
00:32:32	 
		 
00:32:32	Elena, get out of here.
		엘레나, 여기서 나가
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	I could hurt you.
		널 다치게 할
		수도 있어
00:32:35	 
		 
00:32:35	No. You won't.
		아뇨, 그렇지 않아요
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:38	I'm here until the very end.
		끝까지 여기 있을 거에요
00:32:40	 
		 
00:32:40	I'm not leaving you.
		떠나지 않아요
00:32:41	 
		 
00:32:41	Get out of here.
		여기서 나가
00:32:43	 
		 
00:32:43	Aah!
		　
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:48	Hey.
		　
00:32:49	 
		 
00:32:49	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
		　
00:32:50	 
		 
00:32:50	Hang on.
		　
00:32:52	 
		 
00:32:52	Shh. It's ok.
		괜찮아요
00:32:54	 
		 
00:32:54	It's ok.
		It's ok.
		괜찮아요
		괜찮아요
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	It's not ok.
		It's not ok.
		안 괜찮아
		안 괜찮아
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:02	All those years,
		I've blamed Stefan.
		지금까지 항상
		스테판을 탓했어
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:06	No one forced me to love her.
		아무도 그녀를 사랑하라고
		강요하지 않았는데 말야
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:11	It was my own choice.
		내 스스로의 선택이었어
00:33:13	 
		 
00:33:13	Shh.
		　
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	I made the wrong choice.
		내가 잘못된 
		선택을 한 거야
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:23	You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
		스테판한테 
		미안하다고 전해줘
00:33:26	 
		 
00:33:26	Ok?
		알았지?
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:37	I will.
		그럴게요
00:33:38	 
		 
00:33:52	You're very cooperative.
		정말 협조적이군
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	It's almost as if
		you're enjoying it.
		거의 즐기고
		있는 것 같은데?
00:33:57	 
		 
00:34:04	No more.
		더는 안돼
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:06	Not until you give me the cure.
		피를 줄 때 까지
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	Not until we make a deal.
		거래를 할 때 까지지
00:34:09	 
		 
00:34:09	It's your choice, Stefan.
		네 선택이야, 스테판
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:11	You can either remain here
		여기 미스틱 폴즈에 남아서
00:34:13	 
		 
00:34:13	living your life
		in Mystic Falls,
		네 삶을 살아도 되고
00:34:15	 
		 
00:34:15	or you can embrace
		what you truly are,
		네 진정한 모습을
		끌어내도 되지
00:34:20	 
		 
00:34:20	leave town with me,
		나랑 마을을 떠나
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	and save your brother's life.
		그리고 네 형의
		목숨을 구하는 거야
00:34:24	 
		 
00:34:34	That's the spirit.
		바로 그거야
00:34:37	 
		 
00:34:38	Sweetheart...
		내 사랑
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:44	Take this over to Damon
		and come right back.
		이걸 데이먼한테 주고
		다시 돌아와
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:48	You want me to leave?
		떠나라는 거야?
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:49	- No!
		- Yes.
		- 안돼!
		- 그래
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:54	And if I were you...
		내가 너라면...
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:57	I'd hurry.
		서두르겠어
00:34:58	 
		 
00:35:02	She'll never take it to him.
		절대로 갖다 주지
		않을 거야
00:35:04	 
		 
00:35:07	She'll never take it to him.
		갖다 주지 
		않을 거라고
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:11	This is even
		more pitiful than I thought.
		내가 생각했던 것 
		보다 더 처참하군
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	There's still hope.
		아직 희망이 있어요
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:19	I've made a lot of choices
		that have gotten me here.
		내가 이렇게 된 데에는
		많은 선택이 있었어
00:35:23	 
		 
00:35:23	I deserve this.
		난 벌 받아야 해
00:35:26	 
		 
00:35:27	I deserve to die.
		난 죽을 놈이야
00:35:28	 
		 
00:35:28	No.
		아뇨
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:34	You don't.
		그렇지 않아요
00:35:35	 
		 
00:35:35	I do, Elena.
		It's ok.
		맞아, 엘레나
		괜찮아
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:39	'Cause if I'd
		have chosen differently,
		내가 선택을 달리
		했었더라면
00:35:40	 
		 
00:35:40	I wouldn't have met you.
		널 만나지 않았을 거야
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:47	I'm so sorry.
		정말 미안해
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:50	Done so many things
		to hurt you.
		널 정말
		상처받게 했구나
00:35:53	 
		 
00:35:54	It's ok.
		괜찮아요
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:56	I forgive you.
		용서할게요
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:59	I know you love Stefan.
		네가 스테판을
		사랑하는 거 알아
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:02	And it will always be Stefan.
		항상 스테판일 테지
00:36:05	 
		 
00:36:11	But I love you.
		그래도 널 사랑해
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:16	You should know that.
		네가 그걸 
		알아줬으면 해
00:36:18	 
		 
00:36:26	I do.
		알아요
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:29	You should have met me in 1864.
		네가 날 1864년에 
		만났으면 좋았을 텐데
00:36:33	 
		 
00:36:35	You would have liked me.
		날 좋아했을 거야
00:36:37	 
		 
00:36:40	I like you now.
		이제 당신이 좋아요
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:47	Just the way you are.
		당신 그대로의 모습이요
00:36:49	 
		 
00:37:07	Thank you.
		고마워
00:37:09	 
		 
00:37:10	You're welcome.
		천만에요
00:37:11	 
		 
00:37:19	Well, it's me
		you should be thanking.
		나한테 고마워
		해야 하는 거 아닌가?
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	I mean, I'm the one
		who brought the cure.
		내 말은, 내가
		치료제를 갖고 왔거든
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:27	I thought you were dead.
		넌 죽은 줄 알았는데
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:29	I was.
		죽었었죠
00:37:30	 
		 
00:37:31	You got free.
		풀려났군
00:37:33	 
		 
00:37:33	Yep. Finally.
		그래, 마침내
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:37	And you still came here?
		근데 왜 여기로 온 거야?
00:37:40	 
		 
00:37:40	I owed you one.
		신세 졌잖아
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:46	Where's Stefan?
		스테판은 어딨어?
00:37:47	 
		 
00:37:48	Are you sure you care?
		신경쓰는 거 맞아?
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:50	Where is he?
		어딨어?
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:51	He's paying for this.
		이걸 위한 대가를
		치르고 있지
00:37:53	 
		 
00:37:53	He gave himself over to Klaus.
		클라우스한테 
		자신을 바쳤어
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:56	I wouldn't expect him
		anytime soon.
		곧 돌아오지는
		않을 거야
00:37:58	 
		 
00:37:58	What do you mean,
		"he gave himself over"?
		바치다니 무슨 소리야?
00:37:59	 
		 
00:38:00	He just sacrificed everything
		to save his brother,
		자기 형을 구하려고
		모든 걸 희생한 거지
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:03	including you.
		너를 포함해서
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	It's a good thing you have
		Damon to keep you company.
		그래도 아직
		데이먼이 있잖아
00:38:07	 
		 
00:38:09	Good-bye, Elena.
		잘있어, 엘레나
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:11	Oh.
		그리고
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:13	It's ok to love them both.
		둘 다 사랑해도
		괜찮아
00:38:15	 
		 
00:38:16	I did.
		난 그랬거든
00:38:18	 
		 
00:38:34	I suppose, brother,
		있지, 동생
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	you've been reunited
		with our family.
		우리 가족과
		다시 만나게 됐군
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:43	Put him with the others.
		넣어 둬
00:38:45	 
		 
00:38:45	We're leaving town tonight.
		오늘 밤 마을을 떠난다
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:51	So...
		그래서
00:38:52	 
		 
00:38:54	Did katerina make it in time?
		카트리나가 
		제때에 도착한 건가?
00:38:56	 
		 
00:38:57	You won't be seeing her
		again, you know.
		캐서린은 돌아오지
		않을 거야
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	Because she's on vervain?
		마편초를 마셨으니까
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:01	I've been around
		a long time, Stefan.
		난 오랜 세월을
		살았어, 스테판
00:39:03	 
		 
00:39:03	I rarely get played for a fool.
		난 다른 사람에게
		놀아나지 않지
00:39:05	 
		 
00:39:06	Besides, she won't get far.
		게다가, 그리
		멀리 가지도 못할 거야
00:39:07	 
		 
00:39:08	You'll help me see to that.
		넌 내가 그렇게
		하도록 도와야 하고
00:39:10	 
		 
00:39:14	What is it you
		really want from me?
		나한테 정말로
		원하는 게 뭐야?
00:39:17	 
		 
00:39:19	All will be explained in time.
		곧 모든 걸
		설명해 줄게
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:21	Once we leave
		this tragic little town.
		이 끔찍한 마을을
		떠나면 말야
00:39:23	 
		 
00:39:25	Then are we done here?
		그럼 여기선
		볼 일 다 본거야?
00:39:27	 
		 
00:39:27	Can we go?
		가도 되는 건가?
00:39:28	 
		 
00:39:28	Not quite.
		아직 아냐
00:39:29	 
		 
00:39:29	You see, I have a gift for you.
		너한테 줄 
		선물이 있어
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:33	Come here, sweetheart.
		이리 와, 자기
00:39:35	 
		 
00:39:35	Don't be afraid.
		두려워 하지마
00:39:37	 
		 
00:39:42	See, I wanna make sure
		you honor our deal...
		네가 거래를 지키는지
		확실히 하고 싶어서 말야
00:39:45	 
		 
00:39:46	That you'll be of use to me.
		나한테 도움이 되어야지
00:39:49	 
		 
00:39:54	I could have
		compelled her to behave,
		조용히 하라고
		주문을 걸 수도 있었어
00:39:57	 
		 
00:39:57	but a real ripper
		enjoys the hunt.
		하지만 진정한 살인마는
		사냥을 즐기지
00:40:02	 
		 
00:40:31	Now we can go.
		이제 가도록 하지
00:40:33	 
		 
00:40:51	Alaric?
		알라릭?
00:40:53	 
		 
00:41:04	Alaric.
		알라릭
00:41:05	 
		 
00:41:34	Jer.
		제레미
00:41:35	 
		 
00:41:39	Anna?
		애나?
00:41:41	 
		 
00:41:44	Vicky?
		비키?
