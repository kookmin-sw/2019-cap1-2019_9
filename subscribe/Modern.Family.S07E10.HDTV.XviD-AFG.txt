00:00:30	a coupon for a fun day
		with the three of us.

		왜냐면 너무 센스넘치고
00:00:35	 
		 
00:00:35	and we'd never have to do it.
		걍 대충 넘길수있는 그런 선물이잖아요

		그리고 이게 진짜
		재밌는 이유가 뭐냐면요
00:00:47	 
		 
00:00:47	is that it comes with

		엄마 우리 얘기좀해요
00:09:48	 
		 
00:09:49	What are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐하는거야?
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:50	You're supposed to be
		watching the kids.
		애들 돌봐야지

00:09:51	Wesley is a bad influence
		on Joe.
		웨슬리는 조한테 안좋은 영향을
		끼치고 있어요
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:53	He's rude and disrespectful,
		무례하고 건방지죠
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	and I think you should
		nip this friendship in the bud.
		이런 우정은
		싹부터 잘라내야한다고 생각해요
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	He made fun of your mustache,
		didn't he?
		너 수염가지고 놀렸구나
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:59	What kind of 4-year-old
		knows the word "wispy"?
		4살짜리애가 '성기다'라는 단어는
		어떻게 아는거에요?

		매니야 잘보렴
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:05	This close,
		and I still couldn't see it.
		그렇게 가까이서 봤는데
		보이지도 않던데요 뭐
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:08	It's just for
		a little while longer, okay?
		잠깐동안만 참으렴 알겠지
00:10:10	 
		 
00:10:10	Fine.
		좋아요
00:10:11

		밤중에 몇번이나 오줌누러 가시나?
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:20	I'm up to four or five.
		난 네다섯번 가는데

00:10:34	Why are we eating
		off the good china?
		우리 왜 좋은 도자기로
		밥먹는거야?
00:10:36	 
		 
00:10:36	Because we're having
		company for lunch.
		점심 같이 먹을 일행이 있거든

00:10:42	What?! Why?!
		정말?! 왜?!
00:10:44	 
		 
00:10:44	Because a daddy can tell when
		his little girl has a crush.
		왜냐면 아빠는 자기 딸이
		첫사랑에 빠지면 눈치 챌 수 있거든
00:10:47	 
		 
00:10:47	I don't know
		what you're talking about.
		무슨말 하는지 모르겠는데
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Hey, Lily, where are you going?
		릴리야 어디가니?
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	Look, I want you
		to be able to talk to me
		릴리야 이런건 아빠한테
		다 말해도 된단다
00:10:51	 
		 
00:10:51	about this kind of stuff.
		릴리야 이런건 아빠한테
		다 말해도 된단다
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	It's completely natural
		and healthy
		누구한테 감정을 갖고있는건

00:10:55	to have feelings for someone.
		자연스럽고 건강한 현상이거든

00:10:57	And you know what?
		I think he likes you, too.
		그리고 그거알아?
		그 남자애도 너한테 관심있는거 같은데?
00:10:59	 
		 
00:10:59	You just have to
		draw him out, you know?
		그럴땐 확 끌어들여야돼
		무슨소린지 알겠지?
00:11:01	 
		 
00:11:01	- Flirt a little.
		?? How?
		- 약간 치근대면서말야
		- 어떻게요?
00:11:02	 
		 
00:11:02	Uh, well, you just
		sit down in front of him,
		음 뭐 일단 걔 앞에 앉아서
00:11:04	 
		 
00:11:04	look him straight in the eye,
		put a big smile on your face,
		눈 똑바로 쳐다보고
		미소지으면서
00:11:07	 
		 
00:11:07	and ask him some questions,
		질문좀 해봐
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	like, "so, do you
		have any hobbies?
		뭐 예를들면
		'넌 취미가 뭐니?'
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	Is Canada really as beautiful
		as they say it is?
		'캐나다 정말 말처럼 그렇게

		[ Giggles ]
		'너도 베이컨 좋아해?'

00:11:16	Why are you blinking like that?
		아빠 왜 그렇게 눈깜빡여
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	Well, because
		I?셫 sending him signals.
		왜냐면 난 지금 신호보내고있는
		중이거든
00:11:19	 
		 
00:11:19	Okay, what else?
		Oh.
		또 뭐 알려줄거 없어?
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	Definitely compliment him
		on his outfit,
		옷에대해 칭찬도해주고
00:11:22	 
		 
00:11:22	laugh at his jokes.
		농담에 웃어주고
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:23	What if they aren't funny?
		농담이 재미없으면 어떡해
00:11:24	 
		 
00:11:25	Oh, honey,
		the cute ones rarely are.
		얘야 귀여운애들은
		원래 별로 안웃기단다

00:11:26	God doesn't give
		with both hands.
		신은 그런 두가지 재능을
		한꺼번에 안주거든
00:11:28	 
		 
00:11:29	Okay, do not have
		a heart attack,
		삼촌 놀라지 마세요
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	but when you take off
		your blindfold,

		He really is a big fan.
		삼촌 정말 광팬인가봐
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	He even knows
		the name of her gardener.
		정원사 이름까지 알고 있잖아
00:12:16	He even knows
		the name of her gardener.
		 
00:12:17

00:12:17	Ah.
		 
00:12:20	"Goodfellas"?
		영화 '좋은 친구들'은?

00:12:24	- Never seen it. - Okay,
		- We're really not that old.
		- 못들어봤어요
		- 저희 그렇게 나이많지 않다구요

		is a very fine actor,
		레이 리오타씨는 훌륭한
		배우분이시란다
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	and we have taken up
		enough of his time.
		이 분 시간을
		너무 많이 빼앗은것같네
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:30	Stop saying my full name like you
		have to keep telling them who I am.
		자꾸 내가 누군지 알려주려고
		이름 풀네임으로 말하지 말게나

		2 months 15 years ago.
		바바라는 15년 2개월 전에
		여기 살았단다
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	You think the bastards
		would update these things
		그 판매자 자식들이
		최신 소식을 업데이트를 했을것같냐
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	to reflect the current
		movie-star owners.
		그 판매자 자식들이
		최신 소식을 업데이트를 했을것같냐
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:46	Thank you.
		Come on, kids.
		감사합니다 
		얼른 가자 얘들아
00:12:47

00:12:48	No, no, no. I don't want you
		to leave empty-handed.
		아냐 아냐
		빈손으로 가지 말게나
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	Come on in for a selfie.
		셀카라도 하나 찍고가지그래
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:52	Oh. All right.
		Um...
		네 뭐 그러죠
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	- Here.
		?? O-okay.
		- 여기로들 오게
		- 그러죠
00:12:54	 
		 
00:12:54	When you see my movies later,
		나중에 내 영화보고나면
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:56	you're gonna realize
		that this is a special moment.
		이게 얼마나 특별한
		순간이였는지를 알게될거다
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	Come on.
		And "cheeeeese"!
		치즈!
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	Cheese!
		치즈!
00:13:01	 
		 
00:13:01	See? That's an old actor's trick
		for a perfect smile.
		이게 오래된 배우의
		완벽한 미소의 비결이란다
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	Except you and I are smiling.
		You guys aren't smiling.
		우리 둘만 웃고있고
		너희들은 왜 안웃고있는거냐
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:05	W-what's the matter?
		왜그러는거야?
00:13:06	 
		 
00:13:06	It's not you,
		Mr. Liotta.
		리오타씨 때문에 그런게 아니에요
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:08	We just really feel like
		we let our uncle down.
		우리가 삼촌을 실망시킨것같은
		느낌이 들어서요
00:13:10	 
		 
00:13:10	We were supposed to plan
		a special day for his birthday,
		삼촌 생일파티 해주는 날인데
00:13:13	 
		 
00:13:13	and we totally flaked.
		우리가 완전 망쳐버린 기분이라서요
00:13:14	 
		 
00:13:14	We're so sorry.
		죄송해요
00:13:15	 
		 
00:13:16	We tried to figure out
		where to take you,
		어디로 데려갈지 생각도 많이해보고
00:13:17	 
		 
00:13:17	and we know how much
		you love Barbra Streisand.
		삼촌이 바바라 스트라이샌드
		얼마나 좋아하는지도 잘알죠
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	You always give us
		the most awesome gifts.
		삼촌은 저희에게 항상
		멋진 선물들만 주시는데
00:13:22	 
		 
00:13:22	We suck.
		저흰 이따구네요
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:23	Don't say that.
		그런말 마렴
00:13:24	 
		 
00:13:24	I kind of figured
		you didn't have anything
		사실 나도 대충 눈치는 챘단다
00:13:26	 
		 
00:13:26	by the second verse
		of the omelet dance.
		그 루크가 오믈렛댄스 2절댄스
		할때 말이야
00:13:28	 
		 
00:13:28	Hey, I've had no training.
		연습안하고 한거라 그래요
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	But then I saw how hard you were
		trying to make me happy,
		그렇지만 너희들이 나 기쁘게하려고
		얼마나 노력하는지 다 봤거든
00:13:31	 
		 
00:13:31	and I just love
		hanging out with you guys.
		그냥 같이 놀러다닌것만으로도
		재밌었단다
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	Plus, I did get to meet
		Ray Lio--
		그리고 레이 리오ㅌ...
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Ray.
		레이씨도 만나뵙고 말이야
00:13:38	 
		 
00:13:38	You're also gonna meet Barbra.
		바바라도 만날수 있을거요
00:13:40	 
		 
00:13:40	What? No.
		네? 말도안돼
00:13:41	 
		 
00:13:41	I've been meaning
		to go by her house anyway.
		안그래도 바바라 집앞에
		가려고 했거든
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	I've got a bunch of her mail.
		메일 갖다주러 말이야
00:13:44	 
		 
00:13:44	Oh, you don't have to do that.
		아니에요 그렇게까지 
		해주실필요는 없어요
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	No, no, no, no.
		아냐 아냐
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:47	You remind me of --
		당신은 내가 어렸을때
00:13:48	 
		 
00:13:48	of someone that I loved
		when I was a kid.
		내가 좋아하던 그런 부류의 사람
		생각나
00:13:50	 
		 
00:13:50	I had a funny uncle, too.
		나도 재밌는 삼촌이 있었거든
00:13:51	 
		 
00:13:51	Oh.
		 
00:13:53	 
		 
00:13:53	This is so nice of you.
		정말 좋은생각이에요
00:13:54	 
		 
00:13:54	Well, I must admit,
		사실 솔직히 말하면요
00:13:56	 
		 
00:13:56	I-I have a little bit
		of an ulterior motive.
		숨은 의도가 있어요
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	I think Lily has a giant crush
		on your little guy.
		릴리가 그쪽 아들한테
		반한것 같은데요
00:14:00	 
		 
00:14:01	I kind of wanted to set them up.
		그래서 둘을 위해서
		상황을 만들어줬죠
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	I know --
		I'm a hopeless romantic.
		알아요 저도
		이제 한물간 로맨티스트랍니다
00:14:04	 
		 
00:14:04	Oh!
		That's so cute!
		너무 귀여워요!
00:14:06	 
		 
00:14:06	I remember my first crush.
		It was at summer camp.
		저도 제 첫사랑이 기억나네요
		여름캠프때였죠
00:14:08	 
		 
00:14:08	I lived in Toronto,
		and he was from Edmonton,
		전 토론토에살았고
		그남자는 에드먼턴에 살았죠
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	so it was
		very star-crossed.
		불운한 상황이였죠
00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:12	Just like
		our little Romeo and Juliet.
		로미와 줄리엣같은 상황이네요
00:14:14	 
		 
00:14:14	He was the first boy
		I ever loved.
		제가 처음으로 사랑했던 남자애에요
00:14:16	 
		 
00:14:16	Billy Macklin.
