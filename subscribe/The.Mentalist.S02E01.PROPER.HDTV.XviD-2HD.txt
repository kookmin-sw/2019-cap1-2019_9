		이거 정말 조잡하고
		무례하군요!
00:03:05	 
		 
00:03:05	I'll have my husband take this up with your superiors.
		남편더러 당신 상사에게
		연락하라고 하겠어요
00:03:07	 
		 
00:03:07	Mandy, Mandy, Mandy.
		맨디, 맨디..
00:03:08	 
		 
00:03:08	The diet pills are messing with your mind.
		다이어트 약때문에
		기분이 오락가락하죠?
00:03:10	 
		 
00:03:10	This is Sacramento, the big city.
		 Your husband means nothing here.
		새크라멘토는 큰 도시죠
		남편분은 여기서 아무것도 아녜요
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	Okay, that's enough. Agent Lisbon?
		됐어요, 거기까지
		리스본 요원
00:03:15	 
		 
00:03:15	- Give him another moment.
		- We don't need a moment. Case is all most closed.

		시간을 줘보세요
00:03:16	- Give him another moment.
		- We don't need a moment. Case is all most closed.
		 
00:03:16	- Give him another moment.
		- We don't need a moment. Case is all most closed.
		시간 더 필요없어

00:03:19	 
		 
00:03:19	Mandy here is gonna lead us right to the murder weapon.
		여기 맨디가 흉기있는 델
		안내해 주실 거야
00:03:21	 
		 
00:03:21	What?
		뭐라고요?
00:03:22	 
		 
00:03:22	Take my hands. I need physical contact to read your mind.
		제 손 잡으세요
		당신 마음과 교감해야 합니다
00:03:24	 
		 
00:03:24	- You're nuts.
		- Prove it.
		미쳤군요
00:03:25	- You're nuts.
		- Prove it.
		 
00:03:25	- You're nuts.
		- Prove it.
		증거있나요
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	If I'm wrong if we can't find the murder weapon, then I look like an idiot.
		제말이 틀려서 흉기를 못찾으면
		저만 바보꼴 나는거죠
00:03:30	 
		 
00:03:34	Yes, you will.
		그렇게 되시겠죠
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:37	- What are you...

00:03:39	 
		 
00:04:30	 
		짜잔

00:04:32	The murder weapon.
		흉기입니다
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:34	This is crazy. 
		이건 말도 안되요
00:04:35	 
		 
00:04:35	I had no idea that was there.
		저게 저깄는 줄
		전혀 몰랐다고요
00:04:37	 
		 
00:04:37	How could you direct us right to it if you didn't put it there?
		부인이 넣은게 아니면
		어떻게 이쪽을 가리켰죠?
00:04:39	 
		 
00:04:39	I didn't. I...I don't know.
		안가리켰어요!
00:04:40	I didn't. I...I don't know.
		 
00:04:40	I didn't. I...I don't know.
		저..도 몰라요
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:42	But I...I didn't kill that man.
		I...I didn't!
		하지만 전 저남자
		안죽였어요!
00:04:44	 
		 
00:04:44	She's right. She has nothing to do with the murder.
		맞아요, 이분은 살인과
		전혀 상관없습니다
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:46	What?
		뭐?
00:04:46	 
		 
00:04:46	I just used her as a decoy to lull the real killer into giving me clean directional cues.
		그냥 이분을 미끼로 이용해서
00:04:48	I just used her as a decoy to lull the real killer into giving me clean directional cues.
		 
00:04:48	I just used her as a decoy to lull the real killer into giving me clean directional cues.
		진범이 저한테 분명한 신호를
		보내게 유인한 거에요
00:04:51	 
		 
00:04:51	Oh, come on. What are you talking about now?
		말도 안돼요
		이번엔 또 뭡니까?
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:54	Whatever way he didn't want us to go is the way that we went.
		놈이 꺼린 방향이
		흉기를 숨긴 방향이에요
00:04:56	 
		 
00:04:56	The real killer.
		진범 말이요?
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	Yeah, you wanna guess who it is?
		네, 누군지
		맞춰보시겠습니까?
00:04:59	 
		 
00:04:59	Come on, Jane.
		어서, 제인

00:05:03	Hey! 
		이봐요
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:04	Whoa!
		잠깐
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	Excuse me. No, I...I wasn't.
		I...I don't even know that man.
		아니에요, 전 그 사람
		알지도 못했어요
00:05:08	 
		 
00:05:08	Oh, is that right? 
		정말 그럴까요?
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	I'm guessing that he was having an affair with your current wife.
		제 생각엔 당신 현재 아내랑
		저 사람이 바람 피운거 같은데
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	You found out and you forgave her like a sucker.
		당신은 그걸 알고 찌질하게
		부인을 용서해줬죠
00:05:14	 
		 
00:05:14	He saw you here, probably smirked and said something very clever, made you feel... Small.
		그 사람이 당신을 여기서 보고
		입을 잘못 놀렸을 겁니다
00:05:17	He saw you here, probably smirked and said something very clever, made you feel... Small.
		 
00:05:18	He saw you here, probably smirked and said something very clever, made you feel... Small.
		비웃으면서
		당신을 비참하게 했겠죠
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:22	Humiliated you!
		당신에게
		굴욕을 줬겠죠
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:33	- Nice work.
		- What? Case is closed, isn't it?
		잘하는 짓이다
00:05:34	- Nice work.
		- What? Case is closed, isn't it?
		 
00:05:34	- Nice work.
		- What? Case is closed, isn't it?
		왜, 사건 종결했잖아?
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	Hey! Put it down! 
		내려놔!
00:05:37	 
		 
00:05:39	I said drop it now! 
		총 내려놔!

00:06:09	 
		 
00:06:09	It was my feeling that Red John should be our priority,
		레드존 사건을

		테레사, 미안한데
00:07:05	 
		 
00:07:05	But you guys aren't even close to catching this guy.
		자네들 팀원들은 레드존

00:07:08	Fresh set of eyes gotta be a good idea.
		새로운 관점으로 보는 것도
		좋을 거야
00:07:11

		사건에 대해
		얼마나 아십니까?

00:07:22	Maybe that pain is clouding your judgment.
		아마 그 고통때문에
		판단력이 흐려지셨겠죠

00:07:29	 
		이야
00:07:30

00:07:58	We're off Red John
		우리 레드존에서
		손떼게 됐어
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	What?! /Forever? / He cann't do that.
		That's our case./ What did he say?
		- 뭐라고요?
		- 그래도 되는 거에요?
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	That's not right. / And that's not fair.
		Will we get reprimanded? / Who gets it instead? 
		- 그럼 안돼죠!
		- 미넬리가 뭐래요?
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	Quiet.
		조용!
00:08:03	 
		 
00:08:04	Look, this is my fault,
		전부 내 잘못이야
00:08:05	 
		 
00:08:05	but it's a wake-up call for all of us.
		하지만 우리에겐
		자성의 계기가 될거야
00:08:07	 
		 
00:08:07	We've grown slack and unprofessional.
		우린 해이해지고
		기강이 흐려졌어
00:08:09	 
		 
00:08:10	We need to earn back the trust that we've lost.
		이제 우리 신용을
		다시 만회할 때야
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	From now on, we work 100% straight.
		이제부터 완전히
		정석대로 한다
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:15	No more shortcuts. No more ga...
		꼼수나, 속임수는
		쓰지말고..
00:08:17	 
		 
00:08:19	What are you doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:22	You're leaving?
		떠나게?
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:27	Well, frankly, If I can't use this job to seek some kind of personal revenge, then, uh, 
		솔직히 여기서 일하면서
		개인적 원한도 못갚는다면..
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	there's not a whole lot here for me.
		별로 나한텐
		남을 이유가 없는데
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:38	I... I...I don't make anything better.
		내가 있다고
		나아진 것도 아니고
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	I can't bring dead people back to life.
		죽은 사람
		살리는 것도 아니고..
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:42	What good do we do?
		우리가 하는 일이
		좋을 게 뭐야?
00:08:44	 
		 
00:08:44	Drive around California visiting unhappy people.
		캘리포니아를 돌아다니면서
		불행한 사람들 만나는 게 다잖아
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	We're fighting evil and injustice.
		악과 부정에
		맞서싸우잖아요
00:08:50	 
		 
00:08:50	And how's that going?
		그건 잘돼가?
00:08:51	 
		 
00:08:51	Any progress lately?
		최근에 진전이 있었나?
00:08:53	 
		 
00:08:53	We put bad guys away where they can't hurt people.
		나쁜놈들을 잡아넣어서
		아무도 못 해치게 됐죠
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:55	That's good enough.
		그거면 충분합니다
00:08:56	 
		 
00:08:56	Men. I was doing more good as a psychic.
		에이, 난 영매 할때가
		더 좋은 일 많이했어
00:08:58	 
		 
00:08:58	I was giving people hope, at least.
		적어도 사람들한테
		희망은 줬잖아
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	False hope, but hope anyway. 
		헛된 희망이지만
		어쨌건 희망은 맞지
00:09:03	 
		 
00:09:03	You're right. Best you leave.
		그말이 맞아
		떠나는게 최선이야
00:09:05	 
		 
00:09:05	That way you can go back to being a full-time fraud,
		그럼 다시 본업사기꾼으로
		돌아갈 수 있고
00:09:07	 
		 
00:09:08	And we can continue our useless jobs in peace.
		우린 의미없는 직업이나
		계속할 수 있겠지
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	- Well, that's actually not what I said.
		- Yes.
		- 그런 뜻이 아니라..
		- 뭐가 아니야
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:12	We're up. Twenty palms.
		출동입니다

		가자, 반펠트도 와
00:09:15	 
		 
00:09:15	We'll take two vehicles in case we need to split up.
		흩어질 경우를 대비해
		차량 한대 더 가져간다
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:26	I'll see you when you get there.
		가서 봐요

		대장님,
		무시하는 건 아닌데요..
00:09:40	Boss, no disrespect,
		but I think we need Jane.
		 
00:09:40	Boss, no disrespect,
		but I think we need Jane.
		우린 제인이 필요해요
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	We'll manage.
		어떻게든 할 거야
00:09:43	 
		 
00:09:43	Maybe we don't close as many cases,
		물론 제인이 없으면
		예전만큼 해결하진 못해도
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:45	But the ones we do close will be closed right, by professionals.
		정석대로 해결하겠지
00:09:47	But the ones we do close will be closed right, by professionals.

		죄송해요
00:09:59	 
		 
00:10:06	Oh, I'm not gonna leave you in the lurch.
		나 없인 쩔쩔맬거 아냐
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	I'll do one more case.
		이 사건만 하고 갈거야

		백인 여성, 30대 후반

00:10:51	Ran license down already.
		It's a fake. We're calling her Jane Doe.
		면허증 조회해보니 가짜라,
		신원미상입니다
00:10:54	 
		 
00:10:54	Who found the body? 
		사체를 발견한 사람은요?
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:56	The building manager noticed her door was open overnight.
		건물 관리인이
		밤새 문 열린걸 봤다는군요

00:11:39

		어때?
00:11:44	 
		 
00:11:44	Hit with a stun gun then suffocated with the cushion.
		전자충격기로 공격한 후
		쿠션으로 질식사시켰어요
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:49	And they were looking for something, obviously.
		뭔가를 찾고 있었군요
00:11:51	 
		 
00:11:52	Did they find it, Grace?
		그래서 놈들은 찾았을까,
		그레이스?
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Um... It's impossible to tell.
		글쎄요..그런건 모르죠
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:56	Well, it seems they looked everywhere possible. Yes?
		놈들이 웬만한 곳은 다
		뒤져본 것 같네?
00:11:58	 
		 
00:11:58	Yeah.
		그래요
00:12:00	 
		 
00:12:00	So we can assume that they didn't find it, whatever it is.
		그럼 놈들이 찾던게 뭐든간에
		허탕쳤다고 볼 수 있겠네?
00:12:04	 
		 
00:12:04	How so?
		어째서요?
00:12:05	 
		 
00:12:05	Well, let's say there's a hundred places to look for a thing.
		예를 들어 뒤져볼 곳이
		100군데라 치자
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	How likely is it that you will find it in the hundredth place you look?
		찾던 물건을 100번째
		장소서 발견할 확률은?
00:12:11	 
		 
00:12:11	Not very likely, right? 
		그다지 높지 않겠지?
00:12:12	 
		 
00:12:12	What else you got?
		또 뭐 있어?
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:14	Um...
		음..
00:12:14	 
		 
00:12:15	No drug paraphernalia,
		마약 용품도 없고
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	No condoms or other items suggesting prostitution.
		콘돔 등 매춘으로
		보이는 물품도 없네요
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	So... Maybe a personal crime?
		그러니..알고 지내던
		사람 짓일까요?
00:12:22	 
		 
00:12:22	A husband or lover?
		남편이나..애인?
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	Bravo, Grace. But very well-reasoned nonetheless.
		브라보, 그레이스
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	Wrong, I expect,
		틀렸지만 그래도
		논리적이었어
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:35	Thank you, all. Appreciate it.
		감사합니다
00:12:37

		아무것도 없어요

		6개월 전에 현금받고
		팔아버렸대요
00:12:44	 
		 
00:12:44	So basically we know nothing about her. Nice start.
		좋아, 결국 피해자에 대해
		아무것도 모른다는 거네
00:12:47	 
		 
00:12:48	She's a law-abiding middle-class housewife
		피해자는 얌전한
		가정주부였는데
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	That did something bad,
		뭔가 나쁜짓을 한거야
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Someing she feels terribly guilty about...
		그래서 엄청난 죄책감을
		느낀 나머지
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	Guily enough to make her run away and hide.
		여기까지 도망와서
		숨어버렸지
00:12:56	 
		 
00:12:58	Hey! That's evidence.
		You know the drill.
		그건 증거물이잖아!
		알면서 왜그래
00:13:00

00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:11	Sure.
		그럼

		나 이 사건이
		마지막이라고 했잖아

00:14:25	The only reason I'm still here
		내가 아직 여기 있는건
00:14:27	 
		 
00:14:27	Is 'cause I'm worried about how you guys would cope without me.
		자기들이 나 없이
		어떻게 할지 걱정되서야
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:31	Oh, really? So we're lost without you, are we?

00:19:46	She... Never had time for me.
		네..엄만 저한테
		쓸 시간 없었어요
00:19:49	 
		 
00:19:50	So... I could always see through her charm, you know?
		그래서 전 언제나
		엄마의 가식이 보였죠
00:19:52	 
		 
00:19:53	To the selfish cow beneath...

00:20:14	And reality just kinda beat her down.
		그냥 현실에..
		좀 지친 거죠
00:20:17	 
		 
00:20:17	But here's that thing.
		근데 웃긴건요
00:20:18	 
		 
00:20:18	It was only because the theft was in the news
		엄마가 돈 훔친게

00:25:26	But you were making too much money.
		You were having too much fun.
		하지만 너무 돈도 잘벌리고
		너무 재미도 있었죠
00:25:29

00:25:44	 
		 
00:25:45	Really?
		정말요?
00:25:46

00:26:43	Nothing.?
		아무것도?
00:26:44	 
		 
00:26:46	If you sit down by the riverbank and wait long enough,
		강둑에 아주 오래 앉아서
		기다리고 있으면
00:26:49	 
		 
00:26:49	You will see the bodies of your enemies float by.

		너무 안됐어요 모든게..참 안됐어요
00:27:25	 
		 
00:27:26	The poor woman. More troubled than conniving, I'm sure.
		야비한 사람은 아니고 뭔가 딱한 문제가 있었겠죠
00:27:30	 
		 
00:27:30	And you know, it's not the money. It's more the loss of trust.
		돈 보다도 신용을 잃은 게 더 슬픕니다
00:27:34	 
		 
00:27:35	This is very, very much a family firm.
		여긴 가족 경영회사인데
00:27:37	 
		 
00:27:38	And my father always used to say,
		아버지가 늘 말씀하셨죠
00:27:39	 
		 
00:27:39	Jaffe printing is about values, not about machinery.
		자페 회사에선 기계가 아니라
		가치관이 중요하다, 고요
00:27:43	 
		 
00:27:43	Do you know Miles Thorsen?
		마일즈 쏠슨 아세요?
00:27:45

00:27:47	- Are you sure? - Yes.
		확실하세요?
00:27:48	- Are you sure? - Yes.
		 
00:27:48	- Are you sure? - Yes.

00:27:51	Relax.
		걱정말라고
00:27:52	 
		 
00:27:53	I saved her life. she resents me.
		제가 이사람 목숨을 구해줬는데
		저한테 골이 나있죠
00:27:56	 
		 
00:27:56	Oh, really?
		아, 그래요?
00:27:57	 
		 
00:28:01	Jill?

00:28:24	Patrick Jane.
		패트릭 제인입니다
00:28:25	 
		 
00:28:25	We're investigating the murder of Monica Dunninger.
		모니카 더닌저씨
		살인을 수사중입니다
00:28:27	 
		 
00:28:27	Yes. Terrible. horrible.
		네, 참 끔찍하죠
00:28:31	 
		 
00:28:31	You were her direct supervisor, 
		is that right?
		선생님이 그분
		직속 상사였죠?
00:28:33	 
		 
00:28:34	I know what you're gonna say,
		네, 무슨 말
		하실 지 압니다
00:28:35	 
		 
00:28:35	And yes, yes, it was my fault that she stole from Mea culpa. I... should have known. 
		그래요, 모니카가 돈을 훔친건
		"미아 컬파", 라틴어로 내 탓입니다
00:28:41	 
		 
00:28:41	Greg is like family practically.
		  We all make mistakes.
		그렉은 가족같은
		사람이에요
00:28:43	Greg is like family practically.
		  We all make mistakes.
		 
00:28:43	Greg is like family practically.
		  We all make mistakes.
		사람이라면
		실수할 때도 있죠
00:28:44	 
		 
00:28:44	We live, we learn, we move on.
		거기서 배우고,
		계속 나아가는 거죠
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	 
		 
00:28:47	Uh, can you explain to us how she did it? In layman's terms?
		어떤 수법으로 훔쳤는지
		일상 용어로 말해주시겠습니까?
00:28:51	 
		 
00:28:51	Uh, been there, done that
		예전에도 다 한번
		훑은 과정인데요
00:28:52	 
		 
00:28:52	With the top men from the FBI financial unit.
		FBI 금융범죄부
		요원들 왔을때도요
00:28:54	 
		 
00:28:55	Do we really need to go over it again?
		그걸 다시 또
		해야합니까?
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:57	- Yes. - No problem.
		네
00:28:58	- Yes. - No problem.
		 
00:28:59	- Yes. - No problem.
		문제 없습니다
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:04	Thank you.
		고맙습니다
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:08	What exactly was her position here?
		피해자가 정확히 맡은
		직책이 뭐였죠?
00:29:10	 
		 
00:29:10	Assist office manager.
		계장이요
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	She kept the petty cash accounts.
		소액 현금 계좌를
		관리했죠
00:29:14	 
		 
00:29:14	Coffee and doughnut monitor sentially.
		사실상 커피타고
		전화받는 게 일이었죠
00:29:16	 
		 
00:29:16	This was her office.
		여기가 모니카
		사무실이었어요
00:29:18	 
		 
00:29:19	How did she manage to steal so much money?
		그 큰돈을 어떻게
		훔친 겁니까?
00:29:22	 
		 
00:29:22	When the accounting and finance systems were integrated,
		회계부에 방화벽을
		도입했을때
00:29:24	 
		 
00:29:24	Nobody thought to firewall the petty cash accounts.
		아무도 소액현금에
		방화벽 걸 생각을 안했어요
00:29:27	 
		 
00:29:27	Monica acquired user access to the transactional sites
		모니카는 계좌 이체 사이트에
		회원 접근권을 얻어내서
00:29:31	 
		 
00:29:32	And created a false vendor.
		허위로 거래처를
		만들어냈어요
00:29:33	 
		 
00:29:33	I didn't think she had the brains, to be honest.
		솔직히 그정도 머리가
		있을 줄 몰랐어요
00:29:35	 
		 
00:29:35	We don't know exactly how she did it
		정확히 어떤 수법으로
		그렇게 했는진 모릅니다
00:29:38	 
		 
00:29:38	Because she fried her hard drive,
		자기 하드 드라이브를
		싹 밀어버리고
00:29:41	 
		 
00:29:41	And she took her accounts book with her.
		자기 회계장부도
		가지고 사라졌거든요
00:29:43	 
		 
00:29:43	Are we about to look at a whole bunch of numbers?
		이제 숫자만 왕창
		들여다보는 건가?
00:29:45	 
		 
00:29:46	Probably.
		아마도
00:29:47	 
		 
00:29:48	All right. I'll wait in the car.
		그래, 난 차에 있을게
00:29:49	 
		 
00:29:50	Go.
		가
00:29:50	 
		 
00:29:53	Do you know a man named Miles Thorsen?
		마일스 쏠슨이란 사람
		알아요?
00:29:55	 
		 
00:29:56	No.
		아니오
00:29:57	 
		 
00:29:57	You sure? think about it.
		정말요? 생각해보세요
00:29:59	 
		 
00:30:00	I'm sure. who is he?
		확실해요
		그 사람이 누군데요?
00:30:01	 
		 
00:30:02	- Never mind. - please continue.
		아니에요
00:30:02	- Never mind. - please continue.
		 
00:30:02	- Never mind. - please continue.
		계속하세요
00:30:04	 
		 
00:30:05	Would you excuse me?
		잠깐 실례할게요
00:30:07	 
		 
00:30:08	Boss, I think I found something.
		반장님, 뭔가
		건진 거 같아요
00:30:09	 
		 
00:30:10	The victim's daughter, Kessie Dunninger...
		피해자의 딸
		캐시 더닌저요
00:30:11	 
		 
00:30:11	She handles the family money, pay she bills.
		집안 돈을 그애가 관리해서
		청구서 요금도 걔가 내요
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:14	Five months ago, 
		5개월 전부터
00:30:16	 
		 
00:30:16	she stopped paying the rent by standing order, switched to cash.
		월세를 자동이체에서
		현금납부로 바꿨더라고요
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	Same thing with the utity bills.
		Paid in cash.
		공과금도 마찬가집니다
		현금으로 냈죠
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	Nice work. 
		잘했어
00:30:22	 
		 
00:30:23	go and talk to her. She doesn't have a good answer, bring her in.
		가서 만나보고 와
		대답이 시원찮으면 끌고오고
00:30:25	 
		 
00:30:25	Will do, boss.
		그럴게요, 대장님
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	Yes!
		좋아!
00:30:27	 
		 
00:30:38	Why did you hide from us, body?
		왜 숨은 겁니까?
00:30:39	 
		 
00:30:40	Fear, man. Fear
		겁나서 그랬다고요
00:30:43	 
		 
00:30:43	I've been frightened for my life ever since I heard.
		소식 듣고 계속
		죽을까봐 겁났어요
00:30:46	 
		 
00:30:46	Why?
		왜요?
00:30:47	 
		 
00:30:47	Who killed her?
		누가 죽인거에요?
00:30:49	 
		 
00:30:49	Either it was her goober husband finally snapped,
		얼뜨기같은 그여자 남편이
		마침내 폭발해서 죽였으면
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	Which puts me next in line,
		제가 그 다음 목표겠고
00:30:52	 
		 
00:30:52	or it's whoever she went into business with,
		그여자랑 사업하는
		사람들이면
00:30:54	 
		 
00:30:54	And maybe they think I know too much.
		제가 너무 많이 안다고
		생각할지 모르죠
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	She was in business with someone?
		모니카가 사업했어요?
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:57	Just before she disappeared, she came by to see me,
		실종 직전에요
00:30:59	Just before she disappeared, she came by to see me,
		 
00:30:59	Just before she disappeared, she came by to see me,
		절 잠깐 찾아왔는데
00:31:01	 
		 
00:31:01	told me she made a business deal with someone that would make everything all right.
		사업 거래를 맺어서
		이제 다 잘될 거라고 그랬어요
00:31:05	 
		 
00:31:05	A business deal? Were those the words she used?
		사업 거래요?
		정확히 그렇게 말했습니까?
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	Yep.
		네
00:31:09	 
		 
00:31:09	She was starting a new day in her life
		이제 자긴 새 삶을
		시작할거고
00:31:12	 
		 
00:31:12	and wanted to make amends and apogize
		사과하고
		속죄하겠댔어요
00:31:14	 
		 
00:31:14	for being such a pain in the butt,
		남들 열받게 해서요
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	- Which she was. - How so?
		그건 사실이죠
00:31:17	- Which she was. - How so?
		 
00:31:17	- Which she was. - How so?
		어떻게요?
00:31:18	 
		 
00:31:18	She was way too deep into her family.
		And to her kids and all that crap.
		그 여잔..너무 가족이니 뭐니
		이딴걸 신경쓰고
00:31:24	 
		 
00:31:24	Loved those kids.
		애들 엄청 사랑했어요
00:31:26	 
		 
00:31:26	Why do I want to talk to her about her sick boy?
		아니 자기 아픈 아들 얘기는
		나한테 왜하는 거에요?
00:31:30	 
		 
00:31:30	- Like I can help?
		- You're not a doctor.
		- 나한테 말한다고 도움되나
		- 의사도 아닌데 말이죠
00:31:33	 
		 
00:31:33	Exactly.
		그러니까요
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:35	When we were caught that kid,
		She ju... went to pieces, you know?
		그애한테 걸렸을때
		모니카는 완전 무너졌어요
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:39	And I'm like,
		그래서 전
00:31:41	 
		 
00:31:41	Don't get so down on yourself.
		너무 자책하지
		말라고 했죠
00:31:44	 
		 
00:31:46	You gotta love you even if you're a total sew up, right?
		자기자신을 사랑해야죠
		암만 꼴통이라도요
00:31:50	 
		 
00:31:50	The greatest... Love...of all.
		"가장 위대한 사랑"이죠
00:31:54	 
		 
00:31:55	Whitney was right, as usual.
		휘트니 휴스톤 노래가
		늘 진리라니까요
00:31:57	 
		 
00:32:01	Right.
		그래요
00:32:02	 
		 
00:32:03	You know a man named Miles Thorsen?
		마일스 쏠슨이란 사람 아세요?
00:32:04	 
		 
00:32:04	No. Who's he?
		아뇨, 누군데요?
00:32:06	 
		 
00:32:21	Is that ough sugar?
		설탕 충분해요?
00:32:23	 
		 
00:32:23	Yes. Thank you.
		네, 감사합니다
00:32:25	 
		 
00:32:27	So, Cashy, tell me about the money.
		그럼 캐시..
		돈 얘기를 해봐요
00:32:30	 
		 
00:32:30	About a month after she ran off, mom called me,
		엄마가 도망가고
		한달 후에
00:32:32	About a month after she ran off, mom called me,
		 
00:32:32	About a month after she ran off, mom called me,
		엄마한테 전화가 왔어요
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:34	said she wanted to help us out,
		wanted to know how Ansel she was doing.
		우릴 돕고 싶다,
		동생은 잘지내냐,
00:32:38	 
		 
00:32:38	She loves us so much, blah, blah, blah.
		너희를 너무 사랑한다,
		줄줄 늘어놓길래
00:32:42	 
		 
00:32:43	I told her to go to hell, and hung up.
		전 꺼지라그러고
		끊어버렸죠
00:32:46	 
		 
00:32:47	2 days later, I got a letter with $5,000 in cash inside.
		이틀후에 현금 5천달러가
		담긴 봉투가 왔어요
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:51	Any message?
		다른 말은 없었어요?
00:32:53	 
		 
00:32:53	Just "love, mom." That was it.
		"사랑하는 엄마가"
		그게 다해요
00:32:57	 
		 
00:32:57	What was I supposed to do, give it to the police?
		그걸 어떡해요?
		경찰에 갖다줘요?
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	Actually, yes.
		네, 그래야죠
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	Well, I didn't. We really needed the money.
		전 안갖다줬어요
		저흰 너무 쪼들렸으니까
00:33:05	 
		 
00:33:06	Did you ever tell your dad about the money?
		아빠한테도
		그 돈 얘기 했어요?
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	No. No.
		아뇨
00:33:10	No. No.
		 
00:33:11	No. No.
		아뇨
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:12	How often did she send you money?
		엄마가 얼마나 자주
		돈을 보내줬죠?
00:33:15	 
		 
00:33:15	$5,000 every month.
		매달 5천 달라씩이요
00:33:17	 
		 
00:33:17	Did you ever write back to her?
		엄마한테
		답장 보낸 적 있어요?
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:20	No.
		아뇨
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	- I like her for this.
		- How so? 
		- 얘 짓인거 같은데
		- 어째서?
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	She despises mom.
		엄마를 경멸하고
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:25	Mom's got $1 million stolen dollars,
		Gets in contact secretly.
		엄마가 훔친 돈을 부쳐줘서
		남몰래 연락을 취했고
00:33:28	 
		 
00:33:28	Do the mh.
		나머진 뻔하지뭐
00:33:29	 
		 
00:33:29	- Maybe.
		- No? What's your take?
		- 그럴지도
		- 아냐? 자기 생각은 뭔데?
00:33:32	 
		 
00:33:33	I'd be guessing. Could be anybody.
		지금은 모르겠네
		누구든 범인일 수 있어
00:33:34	 
		 
00:33:35	Not anybody. You didn't do it. I didn't do it.
		누구든은 아니지,
		자기나 나는 안죽였잖아
00:33:37	 
		 
00:33:38	You're distracted.
		지금 딴데 정신 팔렸구나
00:33:39	 
		 
00:33:39	You're thinking about Bosco and Red John.
		Focus on the job at hand.
		보스코랑 레드존 생각하지?
		주어진 사건에 집중해
00:33:43	 
		 
00:33:43	You're glad bosco has the Red John case, aren't you?
		자긴 보스코가
		레드존 맡아서 좋지?
00:33:45	 
		 
00:33:46	Bosco is a good agent.
		He's as good as they come.
		보스코는 유능해
		그런 수사관은 또 없지
00:33:49	 
		 
00:33:49	It might not be such a bad thing
		that we're off the case for a while.
		잠시 사건에서 손떼는 것도
		괜찮을지 몰라
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:52	We got too close.
		우린 너무 몰입했어
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	Is that what your shrink tells you? 
		자기 정신상담의가 그래?
00:33:54	 
		 
00:33:54	Everybody tells me that.
		다들 그래
00:33:55	 
		 
00:33:55	But your shrink did tell you that, didn't he?
		근데 자기 정신상담의도
		그런거 맞지?
00:33:57	 
		 
00:33:57	Okay, may... maybe you're right. Maybe... may that's the truth. Maybe we did get a little too close.
		그래, 뭐 그럴지도
		우리가 너무 몰입한걸지도
00:34:01	 
		 
00:34:01	I'm not so sure. But I'll think about it.
		잘은 모르겠지만
		생각해볼게
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:02	Liar.
		거짓말하네
00:34:03	 
		 
00:34:03	I've got a deposition.
		나 증언녹취 하러가야돼
00:34:05	 
		 
00:34:05	See that box over there? It's got Monica's dunninger's possessions in it.
		저기 상자 보이지?
		모니카 더닌저 유품이야
00:34:08	 
		 
00:34:08	Go through it, see what you can see. 
		살펴보고 건질게 있나 봐
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:11	Yes, ma'am.
		알겠습니다
00:34:12	 
		 
00:34:18	Uh, who wants to come with me out to twenty palms
		나 지금 범인 잡으러
		투웬티 팜스 갈 건데
00:34:20	 
		 
00:34:20	to catch the killer?
		같이 갈 사람?
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	Did Lisbon okay this?
		리스본 반장님이
		오케이한 거에요?
00:34:23	 
		 
00:34:24	Of course.
		당연하지
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:38	- What is this place? - Guess.
		여긴 뭐에요?
00:34:39	- What is this place? - Guess.
		 
00:34:39	- What is this place? - Guess.
		맞춰봐
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	Miles Thorsen's house.
		마일스 쏠슨네 집
00:34:41	 
		 
00:34:41	Exactly.
		바로 그거야
00:34:42	 
		 
00:34:42	Who's Miles Thorsen?
		마일스 쏠슨이 누구에요?
00:34:44	 
		 
00:34:44	Oh, uh...
		아..
00:34:45	 
		 
00:34:46	I have no idea.
		나도 전혀 몰라
00:34:47	 
		 
00:34:48	All right, fine. Don't tell me.
		좋아요,
		말해주지 마세요
00:34:50	 
		 
00:34:57	Isn't that your number?
		이거 제인씨 번호 아녜요?
00:34:58	 
		 
00:34:58	Uh, yeah, that's my number.
		응 맞아, 내 번호야
00:35:00	 
		 
00:35:00	That's in case the killer gets here before us.
		범인이 우리보다
		먼저 올까봐 남겨뒀지
00:35:01	 
		 
00:35:01	That way, he'll call us.
		우리한테 전화할테니까
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:03	What's that?
		저건 뭐야?
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:08	Hey, we have no warrant.
		우리 영장도 없잖아요
00:35:09	 
		 
00:35:09	- Don't you hear someone yelling in there?
		- No.
		- 안에서 비명소리 안들려?
		- 아니오
00:35:11	 
		 
00:35:12	Heard something.
		난 뭔가 들었는데
00:35:13	 
		 
00:35:13	There's no yelling.
		I have perfect hearing.
		비명은 무슨
		제 청력 엄청 좋은데
00:35:15	 
		 
00:35:15	I could swear I heard someone.
		나 진짜 뭔가 들렸어
00:35:17	 
		 
00:35:25	Okay, so what are we doing here?
		자 이제 여기서
		뭐하는거죠?
00:35:27	 
		 
00:35:27	Everybody involved is wondering
		관련인물은 하나같이
00:35:29	 
		 
00:35:29	who Miles Thorsen is.
		마일스 쏠슨이 누굴까
		궁금해하고 있어
00:35:32	 
		 
00:35:32	Huh?
		그렇지?
00:35:33	 
		 
00:35:33	The killer will be doubly curious. 
		 Triply, even.
		범인은 두배, 아니
		세배로 궁금해할거야
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:37	Maybe the mysterious Miles Thorsen
		수수께끼의
		마일스 쏠슨이
00:35:39	 
		 
00:35:39	Has what the killer is looking for, what he didn't find.
		살인자가 끝내 못찾은 걸
		갖고 있을지 모르지
00:35:41	 
		 
00:35:41	When they look him up,
		놈들이 찾아보면
00:35:42	 
		 
00:35:42	they'll learn there's a Miles Thorsen who lives right around thcorner from Monica.
		마일스가 모니카집 근처에
		산다는 걸 알아낼 거야
00:35:45	 
		 
00:35:45	Hey, Psto. 
		그때 걸려드는 거지
00:35:46	 
		 
00:35:46	This is exactly the kind of stuff
		the boss was talking about.
		반장님이 말한 게
		바로 이런 거에요
00:35:48	 
		 
00:35:48	She didn't okay this at all, did she? 
		여기 오는거
		허가한 적 없죠?
00:35:50	 
		 
00:35:51	So shoot me.
		그럼 배 째
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:53	"the fax machine revolution...
		The little box that's changing our world."
		"팩스의 혁명
		세상을 바꾼 작은 상자"
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	Why would monica dunninger be reading this book?
		모니카 더닌저가
		왜 이런걸 읽을까?
00:36:01	 
		 
00:36:01	You, Cho, shouldn't enable this kind of crap.
		선배, 이런 짓거리
		못하게 막아요
00:36:03	 
		 
00:36:03	We're not doing anything wrong. What's the problem?
		잘못한것도 없는데
		뭐가 문제야?
00:36:04	 
		 
00:36:05	Uh, burglary, trespassing, willful damage to property.
		절도, 무단침입,
		소유물 고의파손..
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:09	Yeah, door was open.
		문 열려있었는데
00:36:10	 
		 
00:36:10	Uh, no, it wasn't.
		아니었거든요
00:36:11	 
		 
00:36:11	Aha! Of course.
		그래! 그렇지!
00:36:13	 
		 
00:36:13	What?
		뭐가요?
00:36:14	 
		 
00:36:15	Rigsby, you're right.
		릭스비 말이 맞아
00:36:16	 
		 
00:36:16	You shouldn't be here.
		Let us take this. 
		자넨 여기 있지마
		우리가 맡을게
00:36:17	 
		 
00:36:17	You go find the nearest library.
		가장 가까운 도서관 찾아봐
00:36:19	 
		 
00:36:19	Why?
		왜요?
00:36:20	 
		 
00:36:22	Your punishment for being a wuss is I'not gonna tell you. 
		쫌팽이 같이 군 벌로
		말 안해주겠어
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:24	Oh, come on.
		아, 뭐에요
00:36:25	 
		 
00:36:25	Nope, I'm not gonna tell you. 
		안돼, 말 안할거야
00:36:26	 
		 
00:36:27	Fine. Fine. Whatever.
		좋아요, 알아서 하세요
00:36:29	 
		 
00:36:30	- Call when you're there.
		- O ho!
		- 도착하면 전화해
		- 얼씨구!
00:36:32	 
		 
00:36:35	So what's the gag? 
		무슨 장난
		치려는 거에요?
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:36	Oh, there's no gag. Solve the case.
		장난 아니야,
		사건 해결하려는 거지
00:36:38	 
		 
00:36:38	I thought you already did that.
		벌써 해결한 줄
		알았는데요
00:36:40	 
		 
00:36:40	I thought that's why we're waiting here.
		그래서 여기서
		기다리는 거 아녔어요?
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:42	Nope. 
		아니
00:36:42	 
		 
00:36:43	This is, uh...
		이건..
00:36:45	 
		 
00:36:47	This is more of a fishing expedition.
		낚시 탐험 같은 거야
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:49	You know, maybe we get bite.
		Maybe we don't.
		뭔가가 떡밥을 물 수도
		아닐 수도 있지
00:36:52	 
		 
00:36:53	That's the fun of it.
		그맛에 하는 거야
00:36:54	 
		 
00:36:54	We just sit back, relax, dangle our feet in the water.
		느긋하게 기대앉아서
		물에 발을 담그고 있는 거야
00:36:58	 
		 
00:37:11	This guy predicted that 
		이 사람은 2000년쯤엔
00:37:13	 
		 
00:37:13	by the year 2000, every American houseld will have a fax machine.
		미국 전 가정에 팩스가
		보급될 거라고 예연했네
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:19	Can you believe that?
		말이돼?
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	I had a fax machine.
		팩스가 모자라진대
00:37:22	 
		 
00:37:23	You?
		어때?
00:37:24	 
		 
00:37:24	Yeah.
		그래요
00:37:25	 
		 
00:37:27	Wow. Nostradamus of office equipment.
		사무용품계의
		노스트라다무스네
00:37:29	 
		 
00:37:29	See, this is why I don't like fishing.
		이래서 낚시를
		싫어하는 거에요
00:37:31	 
		 
00:37:31	We're not gonna catch anything.
		아무것도 못잡을 걸요
00:37:32	 
		 
00:37:32	We have some very tasty bait. 
		I'm very confident.
		우리 떡밥이 꽤 좋아
		난 자신 있는데
00:37:35	 
		 
00:37:35	Did you consider that the killer found the money already?
		살인자가 돈을 벌써
		찾았을 건 생각해보셨어요?
00:37:37	 
		 
00:37:37	I don't think it was money they were looking for.
		놈들이 찾던건
		돈이 아녔던거 같아
00:37:39	 
		 
00:37:39	I don't think Monica ever had it.
		모니카는 애초에
		갖고있지도 않았던 거 같아
00:37:41	 
		 
00:37:41	Then what did she have then? 
		And who has the money?
		그럼 모니카가 갖고 있던건?
		돈은 누가 갖고있고요?
00:37:43	 
		 
00:37:43	Great bones,

		안녕하세요
00:37:51	 
		 
00:37:51	Did you have a fax machine in 2000?
		2000년대에 집에
		팩스 있었나요?
00:37:54	 
		 
00:37:54	Em... Hi? 
		아..안녕하세요
00:37:56	 
		 
00:37:56	No cause for alarm, sir.
		We're law enforcement officers. CBI.
		놀라지 마십시오
		저희 CBI 경찰입니다
00:37:59	 
		 
00:38:03	"Kimball... Cho." okay.
		킴벌 조..
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:06	What are you doing here, Kiall?
		Is there a problem?
		여기서 뭐하십니까, 킴벌?
		무슨 문제 있나요?
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:08	It's an ongoing investigation, sir.
		현재 수사가
		진행중이라서요
00:38:10	 
		 
00:38:10	We can't ve out any details. 
		어떤 정보도
		드릴 수가 없습니다
00:38:12	 
		 
00:38:12	Grisly homicide, though.
		근데 참 음울한
		살인사건이에요
00:38:14	 
		 
00:38:16	Why don't we take a look at that duplex on Royston? Shall we?
		로이스턴에 있는
		복층부터 살펴볼까요?
00:38:19	 
		 
00:38:20	That's a good call.
		잘 생각하셨습니다
00:38:22	 
		 
00:38:26	- Damn it. - Relax.
		젠장
00:38:27	- Damn it. - Relax.
		 
00:38:27	- Damn it. - Relax.
		긴장풀어
00:38:28	 
		 
00:38:28	He got my name.
		제 이름을 알잖아요
00:38:30	 
		 
00:38:30	Well, you spoke the truth.
		We are an ongoing investigation.
		사실대로 말했잖아
		수사를 진행중이라고
00:38:33	 
		 
00:38:33	Yeah, but we're supposed to be working 100% straight.
		어쨌든 이제부턴
		정석대로만 해야하는데
00:38:35	 
		 
00:38:35	This is not that.
		이건 아니잖아요
00:38:36	 
		 
00:38:44	Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. Wrong address.
		아, 죄송해요
		잘못 찾아왔네요
00:38:47	 
		 
00:38:47	Whoa! Whoa! Rhonda! 
		워, 워
		론다!
00:38:49	 
		 
00:38:50	Come back.
		이리오세요
00:38:51	 
		 
00:38:55	I'm here out of curiosity, that's all.
		궁금해서 와본 거에요
00:38:58	 
		 
00:38:58	Well, of course.
		물론 그러시겠죠
00:39:00	 
		 
00:39:04	I've got nhing else to say without my lawyer.
		변호사 없인
		한마디도 하지 않겠어요
00:39:06	 
		 
00:39:06	You don't need to say anything.
		한마디도 하실
		필요 없습니다
00:39:09	 
		 
00:39:09	I knew it was you from the start.
		처음부터
		당신인 줄 알았어요
00:39:11	 
		 
00:39:12	Thanks for sharing.
		공유해줘서 고맙군요
00:39:13	 
		 
00:39:13	Well, when I say I... I knew was her, I.. I mean, I... I guessed,
		이사람일 줄 알았다는건..
		그러니까..짐작만 했다고
00:39:18	 
		 
00:39:18	I subconsciously thought it was her
		무심결에 그렇게
		생각했단 거지
00:39:20	 
		 
00:39:20	When I saw a photo of her holding
		이사람 사무실에서
00:39:21	 
		 
00:39:22	a large check Outside cedars of Zion.
		시더스 자이온 병원
		수표를 든 사진을 봤을때 말야
00:39:25	 
		 
00:39:26	It was you that stole the $1 million
		from your own company.
		당신이 자기 회사돈
		백만달러를 횡령한 거에요
00:39:30	 
		 
00:39:30	Why would I do that?
		제가 뭐하러
		그런짓을 하지요?
00:39:32	 
		 
00:39:33	Well, degenerate gambling would be my guess.
		도박이든 뭐든
		문제가 있겠죠
00:39:34	 
		 
00:39:34	But whatever your problem is, when threatened with exposure,
		암튼 뭐든간에
		들통날 위험에 처하자
00:39:38	 
		 
00:39:38	You made a deal with poor Monica.
		당신은 불쌍한 모니카와
		거래를 했죠
00:39:40	 
		 
00:39:41	If she'd take the blame and disappear,
		대신 죄를 뒤집어쓰고
		행방불명되면
00:39:44	 
		 
00:39:44	You'd get Ansel into the best cancer program in California
		안셀을 캘리포니아 최고의
		암 센터에 보내주겠다고요
00:39:47	 
		 
00:39:47	And pay her a monthly wage to stay gone.
		그리고 매달
		월급도 준다고 했죠
00:39:51	 
		 
00:39:51	That's absurd.
		말도 안되는군요
00:39:52	 
		 
00:39:52	But then Ansel got cured,
		근데 안셀이 완치되자
00:39:54	 
		 
00:39:54	And there's no way Monica was gonna stay gone, not much longer.
		더이상 모니카가
		숨어있을 이유가 없어졌죠
00:39:59	 
		 
00:39:59	Then you had to silence her.
		그래서 당신은
		입막음을 해야했어요
00:40:01	 
		 
00:40:01	That's pure fiction.
		소설을 쓰시는 군요
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:03	You have no proof at all.
		증거는 전혀 없으시죠
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	Oh. Oh. We... we have proof.
		아, 증거 있습니다
00:40:07	 
		 
00:40:07	 
		기다려보세요
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:08	Yeah, where is it? Here it is. Wyep.
		어디보자..
		여깄다
00:40:11	 
		 
00:40:11	This is gonna be good.
		전화해보자
00:40:12	 
		 
00:40:16	Yep, I'm here.
		네, 저 왔어요
00:40:17	 
		 
00:40:18	I know, I know. "the fax machineevolution" is a library book,
		알겠어요, "팩스의 혁명"은
		도서관 책인데
00:40:23	 
		 
00:40:23	And Monica dunninger swapped it.
		모니카 더닌저가
		바꿔치기 했단 말이죠
00:40:25	 
		 
00:40:26	Hold on. I'm checking it.
		기다려보세요
		확인해볼게요
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:30	Got it. Wait up.
		여깄어요
00:40:31	 
		 
00:40:36	Looks like an accounts book.
		회계장부같은데요
00:40:37	 
		 
00:40:40	There's a DVD in it.
		DVD도 있어요
00:40:42	 
		 
00:40:43	This is just to say that...
		이건..만약을 대비해서
		찍었어
00:40:45	 
		 
00:40:46	in case something happens to me,
		나한테 무슨 일이
		생겼을 경우에
00:40:49	 
		 
00:40:49	That I swear on the bible
		신께 맹세코
00:40:52	 
		 
00:40:52	That everything in the account book is the truth.
		회계장부에 적힌
		모든 게 사실이야
00:40:57	 
		 
00:40:58	I know that I've pretty much lost your love and respect for good.
		아마 이젠 영영
		나를 믿고 사랑하지 않겠지
00:41:02	 
		 
00:41:02	But I hope that this deal that I've made would help Ansel get better
		하지만 이 거래로
		안셀이 나아졌으면 좋겠어
00:41:09	 
		 
00:41:10	and will make up for some of the hurt that I've caused.
		그리고 내가 준 상처도
		조금은 나아졌으면
00:41:15	 
		 
00:41:16	I love you all so much,
		모두들 정말 사랑해
00:41:20	 
		 
00:41:21	Especially you, Kessie,
		특히 널 사랑한다
		캐시
00:41:24	 
		 
00:41:25	Even though you think I don't.
		넌 엄마가 널
		사랑안한다고 생각하지만
00:41:27	 
		 
00:41:29	I'm just so sorry for this mess that I've made.
		이런 난리를 일으켜서
		정말 미안해
00:41:34	 
		 
00:41:36	Please forgive me.
		부디 날 용서하렴
00:41:38	 
		 
00:41:40	Good-bye.
