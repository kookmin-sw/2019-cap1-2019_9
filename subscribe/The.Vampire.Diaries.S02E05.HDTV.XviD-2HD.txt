00:03:58

00:04:49	No.
		아니
00:04:52	 
		 
00:04:52	I hate fighting
		with you,
		even if it's fake.
		연기로 하는 거라도
		너랑 싸우는 거 정말 싫어
00:04:54	 
		 
00:04:55	I know.
		But if katherine thinks
		that we're fighting,
		알아. 우리가 다투면 
		캐서린은
00:04:57	 
		 
00:04:57	Then she'll think
		she's winning.
		자기가 이기고 있다고
		생각할꺼야
00:05:00	 
		 
00:05:00	And that keeps her
		from following through
		on her threats.
		그러면 캐서린은 위협을
		멈출거야
00:05:02	 
		 
00:05:02	Yeah, but that doesn't
		make it any easier.
		그래. 하지만 캐롤라인이 
		감시하는건지
00:05:05	 
		 
00:05:05	Neither does knowing
		that caroline
		will be there
		캐서린에게 다시 모든걸
		보고하는지 조차
00:05:07	 
		 
00:05:07	Reporting everything
		back to her.
		확실히 알 수 없잖아
00:05:09	 
		 
00:05:09	Hey.
		Everything's gonna be ok.
		모두다 잘 될꺼야
00:05:11	 
		 
00:05:11	Yes, we have to keep up
		this ruse for a little while,
		그래. 잠시동안은 계속 
		속여야돼
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:17	But it's the best way
		to keep katherine
		from hurting anybody.
		그래도 너나 다른 사람들을
		캐서린이 해치지 못하게 하는
00:05:19	 
		 
00:05:19	From hurting you.
		최선의 방법이야
00:05:20	 
		 
00:05:20	Just promise me
		that she won't get
		her way with us.
		단지 그녀가 우리에게서 멀어지게
		하기 위한 거라고 약속해줘
00:05:23	 
		 
00:05:23	We can fake a fight,
		우리가 다투는 척 하거나
00:05:25	 
		 
00:05:25	We can pretend that
		her threats are
		tearing us apart.
		캐서린때문에 우리 사이가 
		깨지는 척 해도
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	But none of it's real.
		Ok?
		진짜 그렇게 되진 않겠지?
00:05:31	 
		 
00:05:31	Ok. How about this?
		당연하지
		이렇게 하면 어때?
00:05:33	 
		 
00:05:33	When we're fighting,
		if I say,
		우리가 싸울 때
		내가
00:05:36	 
		 
00:05:36	"I can't do this anymore,
		elena,"
		"너랑 더이상은 안 되겠다" 
		라고 하면
00:05:39	 
		 
00:05:39	What I'll really mean is
		that I love you.
		내 속마음은 
		널 사랑한다는 뜻이야
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:44	And when I say, "fine,
		stefan, whatever,"
		그때 "좋아. 그런던지" 
		라고 하면
00:05:48	 
		 
00:05:48	It really means
		"I love you, too."
		나도 널 사랑한다는 뜻이야
00:05:50	 
		 
00:05:50	Deal.
		그러자
00:05:52

00:06:24	Well, be warned.

		아무 일도 없었어요
		진짜에요
00:06:54	 
		 
00:06:54	I know you think
		I don't notice

		내가 너에게 신경쓰지 않는다고
		생각하겠지만 아니야
00:06:57	 
		 
00:06:57	What's going on
		with you?
		요즘 무슨 일 생긴거 맞지?
00:06:59	 
		 
00:06:59	You know,

00:07:02	 
		 
00:07:02	And then,
		there's reality.
		진짜 같네요
00:07:03	 
		 
00:07:04	Let's not push
		our luck, ok?
		무리하진 말아요
		알았죠?

00:07:42	Stefan, right?
		스테판 맞지?
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	The other salvatore.
		살바토르가 중 나머지 한 놈
00:07:45	 
		 
00:07:45	The nice one.
		전 착한 놈이죠
00:07:48	 
		 
00:07:48	The one offering
		an apology.
		형이 한 행동을
		대신 사과드립니다
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	Not interested.
		관심없다
00:07:51	 
		 
00:07:51	Look, my brother
		acted impulsively.
		제 형이 충동적으로 그랬어요
00:07:53	 
		 
00:07:53	You think?
		충동적으로?
00:07:54	 
		 
00:07:56	If you and damon keep
		at each other's throats,
		만약 데이먼과 그렇게 
		계속 적대시하면
00:07:58	 
		 
00:07:58	Somebody innocent is
		going to get hurt,
		and I don't want that.
		괜한 사람이 다칠거예요
		그러면 안 되잖아요
00:08:00	 
		 
00:08:00	And you have
		family here,
		그리고 아저씨는 여기에
		가족도 있고
00:08:02	 
		 
00:08:02	So I can't imagine
		you'd want that, either.
		아저씨도 누군가가 다치길 원하는 건
		아닐꺼라 생각해요
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	So what do you say
		we just quit
		우리 모두 수컷들의
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:06	The whole alpha male
		fighting thing
		싸움을 멈추고
00:08:08	 
		 
00:08:08	And just call it
		a truce.
		평화롭게 지내는게 어때요?
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	I made that same offer
		to your brother.
		내가 니 형에게 너랑 
		똑같은 제안을 했는데
00:08:13	 
		 
00:08:13	He turned it down.
		니 형은 거절했지
00:08:14	 
		 
00:08:14	With a knife.
		He made a mistake.
		칼로 말이야
		형이 실수한 거에요
00:08:16	 
		 
00:08:16	I'm here to make sure
		that neither one of you
		make another one.
		둘 중 누구도 그러지 말도록
		하기위해 여기 온 거에요
00:08:20	 
		 
00:08:20	Tell your brother
		to watch his back.
		등 조심하라고
		니 형한테 전해라
00:08:22	 
		 
00:08:25	Well,
		I'm guessing that
		글쎄요, 형은 보름달이
00:08:26	 
		 
00:08:26	He only has
		to worry about that
		during a full moon.
		뜰 동안만 아저씨를 걱정할 거예요
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	Otherwise,
		you're not as strong.
		Am I right?
		달리 말하면 아저씨는
		그리 강한게 아니죠. 맞죠?
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	Or you would have killed
		damon by now.
		그렇지 않았다면 지금쯤은 
		벌써 데이먼을 죽였을 거잖아요
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:35	There's one of you.
		There's one of you.
00:08:37	 
		 
00:08:37	There's 2 of us.
		There's 2 of us.
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	I think you're the one
		who needs to watch his back.
		I think you're the one
		who needs to watch his back.
00:08:42	 
		 
00:08:47	If he comes at me...
		만약 니 형이 내게 오면...
00:08:48	 
		 
00:08:48	He won't.
		안 그럴거에요
00:08:51	 
		 
00:09:02	What are you doing?
		너 지금 뭐하는 거냐?
00:09:04	 
		 
00:09:04	Negotiating peace
		on your behalf.
		형을 대신해서
		평화를 협상하고 있는거지
		
00:09:06	 
		 
00:09:06	I don't want peace.
		난 평화따윈 필요없어
00:09:08	 
		 
00:09:08	Oh. Consider it
		opposite day.
		오, 그 반대를 생각해 봐
00:09:10	 
		 
00:09:10	Stefan.
		스테판
00:09:11	 
		 
00:09:11	Please tell me
		you don't seriously think
		악수 한 번으로
		우리 문제를 해결했다고
00:09:13	 
		 
00:09:13	A handshake just solved
		our problem.
		생각하는 건 아니겠지
00:09:14	 
		 
00:09:15	No, actually,
		아니. 사실은
00:09:17	 
		 
00:09:17	I think that
		the first chance
		mason lockwood gets,
		메이슨이 형 가슴에
		말뚝을 박을
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	He's going to drive
		a stake through
		your heart,
		첫번째 기회를 가졌다고 생각해
00:09:20	 
		 
00:09:20	And then,
		through mine--
		그다음 내 가슴에도
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	All because
		you took it upon yourself
		to try to kill him.
		이 모두가 형이 메이슨을 
		죽이기로 마음 먹었기 때문이지
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	So thank you,
		'cause we don't have
		enough problems.
		문제만 만들어 줘서 고맙수
00:09:28	 
		 
00:09:31	[indistinct talking]
		 
00:09:33	 
		 
00:09:43	When did jeremy gilbert
		get so cute?
		제레미 길버트가 언제부터
		저렇게 귀여웠지?
00:09:46	 
		 
00:09:46	Oh, no.
		Oh, no.
00:09:47	 
		 
00:09:47	Stay away.
		That guy's damaged goods.
		가까이 하지마
		재 문제가 많은 애야
00:09:50	 
		 
00:09:54	Hey, man,
		how have you been?
		헤이, 그동안 잘 있었어?
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	Since when?
		언제부터 말이냐?
00:09:57	 
		 
00:09:57	I don't know.
		I haven't seen you much
		글쎄. 요즘들어 형을 
		잘 못 본것 같아서
00:09:58	 
		 
00:09:58	Since
		your father's funeral.
		I just figured that--
		형 아버지 장례식때부터
00:10:00	 
		 
00:10:00	I'm fine, gilbert.
		아무렇지도 않아, 길버트
00:10:02	 
		 
00:10:02	Yeah. Ok.
		알았어
00:10:04	 
		 
00:10:07	Wait. Hold up.
		잠깐, 기다려봐
00:10:09	 
		 
00:10:09	I'm sorry.
		미안해
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:12	Bad day. Bad month.
		요즘 안 좋은 날들의 연속이거든
00:10:14	 
		 
00:10:14	Listen,
		you were cool that day,
		at the funeral.
		장례식에서 너가 해준 말
00:10:17	 
		 
00:10:17	Thanks for that.
		고마웠다
00:10:19	 
		 
00:10:20	Felt like kind of
		a freak show.
		기괴한 쇼처럼 느껴졌거든
00:10:21	 
		 
00:10:22	Yeah, well,
		I know the feeling well.
		그래, 나도 그런 느낌 알아
00:10:24	 
		 
00:10:24	What are you doing here?
		그런데 여기서 뭐하고 있어?
00:10:25	 
		 
00:10:25	Distracting myself.
		마음이 심란해서...
00:10:27	 
		 
00:10:27	Hey,
		thanks for the text.
		Hey,
		문자 고마워
00:10:29	 
		 
00:10:29	Where to?
		어디로 가면 되니?

00:10:30	My place.
		우리 집
00:10:31	 
		 
00:10:31	My mom's gone all day.
		우리 어머니 하루 종일
		나가 계셔서
00:10:33	 
		 
00:10:33	Empty house,
		fully stocked bar.
		집도 비고 술은 가득하거든
00:10:35	 
		 
00:10:35	Margaritas?
		Sure.
		마가리타도?
		물론이지
00:10:37

		너도 올래?
00:10:38	 
		 
00:10:38	Yeah. Yeah.
		I'm in.
		그래. 그래
		나도 갈께

		고마워, 메이슨
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	Hey, sheriff,
		you got a second?
		보안관님, 잠깐 시간 있어요?
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	I'm out of uniform.
		Let's go with liz.
		오늘은 제복도 안 입었잖아
		리즈라고 불러
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	All right, liz.
		좋아요, 리즈
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	I was hoping
		to talk to you
		about the council.
		모임에 대해 말할 것이 있어요
00:10:58	 
		 
00:10:58	I don't know what
		you're talking about.
		너가 무슨 말을 하는 건지 모르겠다
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	I know you and
		the other founding families
		have a secret council.
		당신하고 다른 창립 가족들이
		비밀리 모인다는거 알아요
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:04	If that were true,
		then you know
		it's a secret
		그런게 있다면 그게 비밀이고
00:11:06	 
		 
00:11:06	And isn't discussed with
		non-council members.
		회원이 아닌 사람과는 이야기 
		할 수 없다는 것을 알텐데
00:11:08	 
		 
00:11:08	I know
		I rejected all that,
		but it's only because
		알아요
		내가 그걸 거부한 건
00:11:10	 
		 
00:11:10	I wanted a life
		outside of this town,
		단지 이 마을 밖에서의 
		삶을 원했기 때문이에요
00:11:11	 
		 
00:11:12	Not because
		I was a non-believer.
		그걸 못 믿기 때문이 아니라
00:11:15	 
		 
00:11:15	Look,
		I know vampires exist,
		뱀파이어가 실제 존재한다는 건 알아요
00:11:17	 
		 
00:11:17	And you have
		2 of them living
		right under your nose.
		당신 관할에 2놈이 살고 있다는 것도요
00:11:20	 
		 
00:11:20	Really?
		Yeah.
		진짜로?
		예
00:11:21	 
		 
00:11:21	And who would they be?
		그게 누군데?
00:11:23	 
		 
00:11:25	Damon
		and stefan salvatore.
		데이먼과 스테판이요
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:29	That's impossible.
		말도 안돼
00:11:31	 
		 
00:11:31	I know damon salvatore.
		데이먼을 잘 아는데
00:11:32	 
		 
00:11:32	Do you know
		what he's done
		for this town?
		데이먼이 이 마을을 위해
		뭘 했는지 알기나 해?
00:11:34	 
		 
00:11:34	I know it's a lot
		to digest.
		이해하기 힘들다는 거 알아요
00:11:36	 
		 
00:11:36	No, no, no.
		I have watched him
		kill vampires.
		아니, 아니야
		데이먼이 뱀파이어를 죽이는 걸
		 내가 직접 목격했어
00:11:38	 
		 
00:11:38	He's an ally.
		He's part of
		the council.
		그는 우리 편이야
		모임 회원이라고
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:40	Think about it.
		잘 생각해봐요
00:11:41	 
		 
00:11:41	When did
		the vampire attacks begin?
		뱀파이어들이 공격할 때가 
		언제쯤이었는지
00:11:43	 
		 
00:11:43	When damon
		and stefan salvatore
		moved to town?
		데이먼과 스테판이 마을에 
		왔을 때 부터 아니었어요?
00:11:45	 
		 
00:11:45	They walk in the sun,
		mason.
		개들은 낮에도 돌아다녔어. 메이슨
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	They've evolved.
		It's not 1864.
		그들은 이미 진화했어요
		지금은 1864년이 아니라구요
00:11:49	 
		 
00:11:49	They've figured it out,
		liz.
		그들은 방법을 이미 
		생각해 놓았어요. 리즈
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	No.
		아니
00:11:53	 
		 
00:11:53	Damon salvatore is
		my friend.
		데이먼은 내 친구야
00:11:56	 
		 
00:12:02	What if
		I can prove it to you?
		내가 그것을 증명하면요?
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:12	so, suddenly,
		she's in the running for
		mother of the year,
		정말 갑자기 올해의 장한 어머니 
		상이라도 탈려나봐
00:12:12	 
		정말 갑자기 올해의 장한 어머니 
		상이라도 탈려나봐
00:12:13	 
		 
00:12:14	Just when I'm trying
		to avoid her the most.
		그래서 최대한 엄마를 피하고 있어
00:12:17	 
		 
00:12:17	I'm babbling.
		내가 너무 재잘거렸지
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:18	You don't want
		to hear all this.
		넌 관심도 없는데
00:12:20	 
		 
00:12:20	Oh, um. No. I'm sorry.
		오,음, 아니야, 미안해
00:12:23	 
		 
00:12:23	Then what happened?
		그래서 어떻게 됬는데?
00:12:24	 
		 
00:12:24	Well, I was a bitch,
		내가 좀 못되게 굴었어
00:12:28	 
		 
00:12:28	Which is par for
		the course with us.
		우리에겐 평범한 일이지만
00:12:30	 
		 
00:12:32	So, how are things
		with you and stefan?
		너하고 스테판은 어떻게 돼가고 있어?
00:12:35	 
		 
00:12:35	Anything?
		[sighs]
		무슨 일이라도 있었어?
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	No,
		not since the fight.
		아니, 싸운 후로 아무일도
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	He's been
		pushing me away
		스테판이 날 자꾸 밀어내는것 같아
00:12:40	 
		 
00:12:40	Because he thinks that
		katherine might get
		jealous enough to hurt me.
		스테판은 캐서린이 날 다치게 할 
		정도로 질투한다고 생각하거든
00:12:43	 
		 
00:12:43	I just don't know how
		to change his mind.
		스테판 마음을 어떻게 돌려
		 놓을 지 모르겠어
00:12:46	 
		 
00:12:48	You said that
		katherine's dangerous.
		캐서린은 위험하다고 너가 말했잖아
00:12:51	 
		 
00:12:51	Maybe he's got a point.
		아마 스테판도 그렇다고 
		생각했나보지
00:12:53	 
		 
00:12:53	Yeah, I know
		that she's dangerous,
		그래, 캐서린이 위험하다는 것도 알고
00:12:55	 
		 
00:12:55	And I know that
		he's just trying
		to protect me.
		스테판이 날 보호하려고 
		한다는 것도 잘 알아
00:12:58	 
		 
00:12:58	But it feels like
		giving up.
		하지만 포기하는 
		것처럼 느껴져
00:13:00	 
		 
00:13:00	And I--I just...
		난 단지...
00:13:03	 
		 
00:13:03	Just what?
		단지 뭐?
00:13:05	 
		 
00:13:06	I just thought
		that we were stronger
		than that.
		우리가 그것보다는 더 
		강할거라고 생각했거든
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:13	Hey, I saw you
		with mason earlier.
		What was that about?
		아까 메이슨하고 이야기하는 걸 봤어요
		무슨 일이었어요?
00:13:16	 
		 
00:13:16	Oh, I was just asking him
		숲 청소하는 것을
00:13:18	 
		 
00:13:18	To help with
		the clean-up
		in the woods.
		도와줄 수 있냐고 물어봤어
00:13:20	 
		 
00:13:20	That's what
		I'm here for.
		Put me to work.
		그런 이유라면 제가 있잖아요
		제게 시켜주세요
00:13:23	 
		 
00:13:24	Should I go help him?
		제가 가서 도울까요?
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	Oh, no, no.
		You know what? He's--
		오, 아니야. 
		있잖아, 그는 말이야...
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	I'm sure he's fine.
		그는 괜찮을거야
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:32	Are you ok, liz?
		무슨 일 있어요, 리즈?
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	You seem really upset.
		뭔가 곤란한 것 처럼 보여요
00:13:36	 
		 
00:13:36	It's caroline.
		We had a moment.
		캐롤라인때문이야
		일이 좀 있었거든
00:13:39	 
		 
00:13:40	Anything I can do?
		제가 도와 들일 일이 있을까요?
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	No, damon, thank you.
		아니야, 데이먼
		고마워
00:13:45	 
		 
00:13:45	It's just
		horrible parenting skills
		paying off in spades.
		결정적일 때 보여줄 부모로써
		 기술이 부족할 뿐이야
00:13:50	 
		 
00:14:01	Uh-oh.
		Uh-oh.
00:14:02	 
		 
00:14:02	Longing looks
		are being exchanged.
		갈망하는 눈빛을
		보내는데
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:06	I'm gonna go talk
		to him.
		가서 이야기 좀 
		해야 겠어
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:07	No, elena.
		I think it's a bad idea.
		아니, 엘레나
		좋은 생각이 아닌 것 같아
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:10	I--
		[sighs]
		I--

00:14:12	 
		 
00:14:16	What's her problem?
		무슨 문제있어?
00:14:18	 
		 
00:14:18	Don't worry about it.
		걱정하지마
00:14:19	 
		 
00:14:19	Why are you being
		such a bitch
		to your mom?
		너 요즘 너희 엄마에게 
		왜 그렇게 못되게구냐?
00:14:21	 
		 
00:14:21	Don't worry about it.
		걱정하지 말랬지
00:14:25	 
		 
00:14:28	Do you still care
		about katherine?
		너 계속 캐서린 신경쓰는 거야?
00:14:30	 
		 
00:14:30	Don't do this. Please,
		don't turn this into
		something it's not.
		그만해, 제발
		아무것도 아닌 일을 크게 만들지마
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:33	So this isn't up
		for discussion.
		그럼 이 일에 대해 
		아무 말도 하지 말자고?
00:14:36	 
		 
00:14:36	Is that
		what you're saying?
		너가 원하는 게 이거야?
00:14:37	 
		 
00:14:37	No, I'm saying that
		this isn't up for
		discussion right now
		아니, 내 말을 지금 여기서
		그 이야기를 하지 말자는 뜻이야
00:14:41	 
		 
00:14:41	Because
		we have ears on us.
		우리 이야기에 관심갖는 
		사람들이 있어서
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:46	Ok. When?
		I don't know.
		좋아, 그럼 언제?
		몰라
00:14:48	 
		 
00:14:48	I saw her, stefan.
		나 캐서린을 봤어. 스테판
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	It's like
		we're the same person.
		우린 완전히 똑같았다고
00:14:54	 
		 
00:14:54	How could you hate her
		and be in love with me?
		어떻게 그녀를 미워하면서
		나하고는 사랑할 수 있어?
00:14:57	 
		 
00:14:57	You're reaching.
		I'm not--
		I'm not damon.
		넌 여기 있잖아
		난... 난 형과는 달라
00:14:59	 
		 
00:14:59	How about
		we don't bring damon
		into this right now?
		지금 당장 여기로 
		데이먼을 부르는 게 어때?
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	You know, I can't...
		있잖아. 난 정말,,,
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:06	I can't do this

		나 더이상은 너랑 안되겠다
		엘레나
00:15:09	 
		 
00:15:12	Fine, stefan. Whatever.
		좋아, 그러던지 마음대로 해
00:15:17	 
		 
00:15:20	Relationships are about

00:15:45	 
		 
00:15:45	Um, look.
		음, 있잖아
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:48	I'm really embarrassed
		about slutting it up
		with you
		널 유혹한 거 정말 당황스러웠어
00:15:50	 
		 
00:15:50	That day
		at the swimming hole.
		연못에서 그 날 말이야
00:15:52	 
		 
00:15:52	I'm really not
		like that,
		I promise you.
		그건 진짜 나답지 못했어
		정말이야
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:54	No need
		to apologize.
		괜찮아
		사과할 필요없어
00:15:56	 
		 
00:15:56	Friends?
		Yeah. Sure.
		그럼 우리 아직 친구지?
		물론
00:15:58	 
		 
00:15:58	[music playing]
		 
00:16:01	 
		 
00:16:06	Can I see?
		이거 봐도 돼?
00:16:08	 
		 
00:16:08	Uh, no. No.

00:16:15	 
		 
00:16:15	Ok. Yeah.
		Check it out.
		좋아, 그러지 뭐

		형도 여전히 그려?
00:16:37	 
		 
00:16:37	A little.

00:16:49	You need a drink?
		Yes.
		한 잔 할래?
		그래

		뭐 어찌됐는 아마추어 솜씨지만
00:16:52	 
		 
00:16:52	I've seen

00:17:15	Why wolf pictures?
		왜 늑대를 그렸어?
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	Because...
		나...
00:17:19	 
		 
00:17:19	Because I know.

00:17:38	Working hard?
		열심히 일 하는 중인감?
00:17:39	 
		 
00:17:39	Doing my part.
		맡은 일을 하는 중이지
00:17:41	 
		 
00:17:41	I heard
		you talked to stefan.
		너가 스테판이랑 한 이야기 들었다
00:17:42	 
		 
00:17:42	Nice guy.
		좋은 녀석이더군
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	Yeah.
		A lot nicer than me.
		그래. 나보다는 훨씬
		좋은 놈이지
00:17:45	 
		 
00:17:45	Well,
		nice is overrated.
		자신을 과대 평가하는 군
00:17:47	 
		 
00:17:47	That's what I thought.
		Heh.
		나도 그렇게 생각해
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	You have a good day,
		damon.
		잘 지내라. 데이먼
00:17:52	 
		 
00:17:54	Please tell me

00:17:58	 
		 
00:17:58	So what's up with
		this, um, faux drama
		in your relationship?
		그 가짜 연극은 왜 하는거냐?
00:18:02	 
		 
00:18:02	What are you talking about?
		Oh, come on, stefan.
		무슨 소릴 하는거야?
		이거 왜 이래. 스테판
00:18:05	 
		 
00:18:05	You and elena
		don't fight,
		너랑 엘레나 안 싸우잖아
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	Especially not over me.
		특히 나를 두고 말이야
00:18:09	 
		 
00:18:09	Drop it, damon.
		그만 둬, 데이먼
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	With pleasure.
		마음대로 해
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	Would you like

00:18:51	No.
		아니
00:18:53	 
		 
00:18:55	You know,
		maybe it's for the best.
		이게 너한테 최선일지도 몰라
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	It's not for the best,
		caroline.
		전혀아니야, 캐롤라인
00:18:58	 
		 
00:18:58	None of this is
		for the best.
		잘된건 아무것도 없어

00:19:05	I...
		나...
00:19:07	 
		 
00:19:07	I don't mean
		to take it out on you.
		너에게 화풀이 할 뜻은 없었어
00:19:09

		아니, 아니야
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	I'm not being
		a good friend at all.
		난 좋은 친구가 전혀 아니야

00:19:26	Where's my mom going?
		우리 엄마 지금 어디 가는거지?
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:30	Look, I can't talk here.
		Just get jess
		여기서 말할 수 없어
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	And meet me
		down the hill
		at the entrance,
		입구에 있는 언덕 아래에서 만나요
00:19:34	 
		 
00:19:34	And bring the--
		yes, we need it.
		그리고 그걸...
		예, 그것이 필요해요

00:19:38	Oh, nothing. I, uh--
		I just have something--
		아니, 아무것도, 음...
		지금 뭐가 필요해서...
00:19:40	 
		 
00:19:40	You mean work?
		I mean,

00:19:44	It's important.
		It always is.
		중요한 일이야

		but he's making threats.
		마음에는 안 들지만
		그가 위협을 했어
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	He could expose us.
		We need to put him down.
		그는 우릴 폭로할 수 있어
		되받아 쳐야해
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:23	All right.

00:21:38	My uncle john left

		우리 삼촌 존이

		a crazy gilbert ancestor
		오래된 일기장을 두고 떠났는데
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	Who wrote about
		this curse that ran
		in your family.
		거기에 형 집안에 얽힌
		저주가 써져 있었어
00:21:46	 
		 
00:21:46	A curse about what?
		무슨 저주?
00:21:48

		말도 안 되지?

		그런데 형네 삼촌이 
		우리 마을에 온 직후

00:21:55	By a wolf

		그건 진짜
		너무 이상하잖아

00:22:02	Is it true?
		이게 사실이야?
00:22:03	 
		 
00:22:05	About my uncle?
		우리 삼촌 말이냐?

		I'm sorry, werewolf?
		늑대?
		아니지, 늑대인간?
00:22:15	 
		 
00:22:15	No--
		아니
00:22:16	 
		 
00:22:16	I mean, not yet.
		내 말은, 아직 아니야
00:22:20	 
		 
00:22:20	You know?
		Hell, just--
		있잖아
00:22:21	 
		 
00:22:21	Just saying that out loud,
		I sound insane.
		이 말을 직접하니깐
		정말 미친 소리 같다
00:22:23	 
		 
00:22:23	I don't think so.
		난 그렇게 생각안 해
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:25	But then again,
		I always did believe
		in the crazy stuff.
		난 항상 이런 괴상한 것들을
		믿어왔거든
00:22:28	 
		 
00:22:28	According to my uncle,
		you have to trigger
		the curse.
		우리 삼촌 말에 따르면
		저주에는 계기가 필요하댔어
00:22:31	 
		 
00:22:31	Somebody has to die
		at your hands,
		직접 누군가를 죽이는 거 말이야
00:22:34	 
		 
00:22:34	Like murder,
		or an accident.
		살인이나 사고로
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	I basically have
		to cause death,
		누군가를 죽이게 되서
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	And then, boom,
		next full moon,
		다음 보름달이 뜨면
00:22:40	 
		 
00:22:40	I'm howling
		on all fours.
		4발 달린 짐승으로 울부짖게 되는 거지
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	Is that
		why he came back,
		to tell you all this?
		삼촌은 이 모든 걸 형에게
		말해 줄려고 여기 온거야?
00:22:44	 
		 
00:22:44	Yeah, right.
		He had to tell me.
		그럴 것 같냐
		나한테 말해야만 했어
00:22:46	 
		 
00:22:46	I caught him.
		He's not here for me.
		삼촌은 나 때문에 
		여기 있는 것이 아니야
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:53	He's here for this.
		이것 때문에 여기 있는거라구
00:22:55	 
		 
00:23:00	Down the stairs
		to the left.
		계단 내려가서 
		왼쪽으로 가세요
00:23:03	 
		 
00:23:07	Careful.
		The wooden bullets
		and vervain
		조심해. 나무 총알이랑 
		마편초 효력이
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:08	Won't keep them down
		for long.
		What is this place?
		그리 오래 지속되진 않으니까
		여긴 뭐하는 곳이지?
00:23:10	 
		 
00:23:10	Old slave quarters
		from the original
		lockwood house.
		오래전 락우드 본가의
		노예 숙소예요
00:23:13	 
		 
00:23:13	Go on.
		가죠
00:23:15	 
		 
00:23:16	Thank you, mason.
		I appreciate
		all you've done.
		고마워 메이슨
		모두 니 덕분이다
00:23:19	 
		 
00:23:19	We got it from here.
		우린 전혀 몰랐었다
00:23:21	 
		 
00:23:22	Hey, you're going
		to kill them, right?
		애들을 죽일거죠?
00:23:25	 
		 
00:23:25	Yes. That's why
		you should go.
		그래. 그럴려면 너가 나가야돼
00:23:27	 
		 
00:23:27	I'm here as the council,
		not the law.
		법이 아니라 위원회 규칙이거든
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	You can't be
		a party to this.
		넌 여기에 동참할 수 없어
00:23:30	 
		 
00:23:30	It's for
		your own protection.
		너를 위해서야
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	Liz,
		I don't care about--
		리즈, 걱정말아요
00:23:32	 
		 
00:23:33	Yes, but I do,
		and I'm not asking.
		그래, 하지만 난 그래야돼
		명령이야
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	Good-bye, mason.
		나가라, 메이슨
00:23:36	 
		 
00:23:40	Hey, just don't take
		any chances.
		조심해요

00:24:07	Have you seen
		stefan?
		스테판 보셨어요?
00:24:08	 
		 
00:24:08	Yeah, elena,

00:24:13	Where are they?
		어디있어요?
00:24:14	 
		 
00:24:14	You don't need me
		for that.
		내 대답이 필요없을 텐데
00:24:16	 
		 
00:24:16	I'll let your friend here
		sniff 'em out.
		니 친구가 수상스럽군
00:24:18	 
		 
00:24:20	Does your mother know
		what you are?
		너가 뭔지 너희 엄마도 아니?

00:24:22	I'm happy to tell her.

00:25:02	 
		 
00:25:02	Answer me,
		and you don't get shot.
		Understand?

00:28:56	What is it?
		이게 뭐야
00:28:57	 
		 
00:28:58	It's a moonstone.
		I looked it up online.
		월장석
		인터넷에서 찾아 봤는데
00:29:00	 
		 
00:29:00	It's a natural rock,
		but they're supposed
		to have
		자연석이지만
		이것과 관련된
00:29:03	 
		 
00:29:03	All sorts of
		supernatural legends
		attached to them.
		초자연적인 전설이 많은 것 같아
00:29:06	 
		 
00:29:06	Why haven't you
		given it to him?
		왜 삼촌에게 주지 않은건데?
00:29:08	 
		 
00:29:09	'cause he wants it.
		[chuckles]
		왜냐면 삼촌이 이걸
		원했거든
00:29:11	 
		 
00:29:11	I'm a dick that way.
		나 원래 이런 놈이잖아
00:29:13	 
		 
00:29:13	It's important to him,
		for some reason,
		어떤 이유로 삼촌에게
		중요하지만
00:29:15	 
		 
00:29:15	But I don't trust the guy.
		난 삼촌을 믿지 않아
00:29:17	 
		 
00:29:17	So, I'm not just going
		to hand it to him.
		그래서 그냥은 넘기지 
		않을거야
00:29:19	 
		 
00:29:19	[door opens]
		 
00:29:20

00:30:09

		가만히 있어
		어서 주라고
00:30:12	 
		 
00:30:12	[screams]
		 
00:30:14	 
		 
00:30:17	Sarah!
		Oh, my god!
		새라
00:30:18	 
		 
00:30:18	Sarah! Sarah!
		Sarah! Sarah!
00:30:19	 
		 
00:30:19	She fell!
		She's not moving!
		굴러 떨어졌어
		움직이지 않아
00:30:21	 
		 
00:30:21	Oh, my god.
		Oh, my god.
00:30:23	 
		 
00:30:24	Fooled you.
		속았지
00:30:26	 
		 
00:30:26	Oh, my god.
		[laughs and inhales]
		Oh, my god.
00:30:29	 
		 
00:30:29	You pushed me
		down the stairs.
		너 나를 계단 아래로
		밀쳤어
00:30:31	 
		 
00:30:31	Look, he didn't--
		he didn't mean it, ok?
		형이 진심으로
		그런거 아냐, 알았어?
00:30:34	 
		 
00:30:35	Ohh.
		Ohh.
00:30:36	 
		 
00:30:36	You got her?
		Yeah.
		괜찮겠어?
		그래
00:30:38	 
		 
00:30:44	[door opens]
		 
00:30:45	 
		 
00:30:45	Hey. Sorry.
		That took forever.
		미안, 오래 걸렸지?
00:30:48	 
		 
00:30:49	I just didn't know
		how long my mom
		was going to be here.
		우리 엄마가 여기서 얼마나
		있을지 몰라서 말이야
00:30:51	 
		 
00:30:51	Damon says
		it will take 3 days tops
		데이먼 말로는 
		엄마 몸에서
00:30:53	 
		 
00:30:53	For the vervain
		to leave her system.
		마편초가 빠져 나가는데
		3일이면 충분하데
00:30:55	 
		 
00:30:55	Maybe even sooner.
		아마 더 빠를 수도 있고
00:30:57	 
		 
00:30:58	Hey.
		Hey.
		Hey.
		Hey.
00:31:00	 
		 
00:31:00	Get some bunny
		in you?
		Get some bunny
		in you?
00:31:02	 
		 
00:31:02	Yeah. I'm feeling
		much better, thank you.
		응, 많이 좋아 졌어
		고마워
00:31:04	 
		 
00:31:04	A stomach bug.
		A stomach bug.
00:31:06	 
		 
00:31:06	Yeah.
		It came on fast.
		Yeah.
		It came on fast.
00:31:08	 
		 
00:31:08	I'll definitely be out
		tomorrow...
		내일이면 나갈 수 있을거에요
00:31:10	 
		 
00:31:10	[clicks]
		 
00:31:13	 
		 
00:31:13	Or longer.
		I'll text you.
		더 걸릴 수도 있고요
		연락드리겠습니다
00:31:16	 
		 
00:31:16	Yeah.
		Yeah.
00:31:17	 
		 
00:31:17	Good night.
		[beeps]
		안녕히 계세요
00:31:19	 
		 
00:31:19	Thank you.
		고마워요
00:31:22	 
		 
00:31:24	It's not exactly the ritz,
		but it's secure.
		여기가 호화롭지 못해도
		안전하죠
00:31:28	 
		 
00:31:28	I brought you
		good thread count.
		I brought you
		good thread count.
00:31:29	 
		 
00:31:29	And once the vervain's
		worked its way out
		of your system,
		그리고 마편초가 몸 밖으로 
		배출되는데로
00:31:31	 
		 
00:31:31	I will compel you
		to forget everything,
		모든 걸 잊게 해 주겠어요
00:31:34	 
		 
00:31:34	And you'll be
		a free woman.
		그다음 자유롭게 해줄께요
00:31:36	 
		 
00:31:36	Keep caroline
		away from me,
		please.
		캐롤라인이 내 곁에
		오지 못하게 해줘
00:31:39	 
		 
00:31:40	I don't want
		to see her.
		그 애를 보고 싶지 않아
00:31:42	 
		 
00:31:42	She's your daughter,
		liz.
		그 애는 당신 딸이에요. 리즈
00:31:43	 
		 
00:31:43	Not anymore.
		더이상은 아니야
00:31:46	 
		 
00:31:46	My daughter's
		gone.
		내 딸은 이미 죽었어
00:31:49	 
		 
00:31:49	You have no idea
		how wrong you are
		about that.
		지금 얼마나 나쁜 말을
		한건지 모를거예요
00:31:52	 
		 
00:32:28	Stefan?
		I think that
		we should--
		스테판, 우리가...
00:32:31	 
		 
00:32:33	What are you doing?
		지금 뭐하는 거야?
00:32:34	 
		 
00:32:35	Katherine took
		a little vervain
		every day
		캐서린은 매일 조금씩
		마편초를 먹었어
00:32:37	 
		 
00:32:37	And built up
		a tolerance to it.
		그래서 그것에 내성이 
		생기게 했어
00:32:39	 
		 
00:32:42	I could do the same
		with blood.
		나도 피로 똑같이
		할 수 있을꺼야
00:32:44	 
		 
00:32:45	I could learn
		to control myself on it.
		피를 제어하는 법을
		익힐수 있을 꺼야
00:32:47	 
		 
00:32:47	But you can't,
		stefan.
		You don't have to.
		안돼, 스테판
		해서는 안돼
00:32:51	 
		 
00:32:53	I almost died tonight,
		elena,
		난 어제 거의 죽을 뻔 했어
		엘레나
00:32:56	 
		 
00:32:57	Because I was too weak.
		내가 너무 약해서
00:32:58	 
		 
00:32:58	But the last time
		that you drank
		human blood--
		하지만 지나번에 너가
		인간피를 먹었을때...
00:33:00	 
		 
00:33:00	I told you
		I'd find a way to stop
		katherine, didn't I?
		캐서린을 막을 방법을 
		찾을 거라고 내가 말했지?
00:33:02	 
		 
00:33:02	Well, this is the way.
		This is the only way,
		그게 이거야
		이게 유일한 방법이라고
00:33:04	 
		 
00:33:04	Because
		she's stronger than me.
		캐서린은 나보다 더
		강하기 때문에
00:33:06	 
		 
00:33:06	And unless that changes,
		I can't protect you.
		변하지 않으면 
		넌 지킬 수가 없어
00:33:08	 
		 
00:33:08	[sighs]
		can we talk
		about this later?
		우리 다음에 이야기하자
00:33:10	 
		 
00:33:10	He can hear us
		wherever we are
		우리가 어디에 있던지
		형은 들을 수 있어
00:33:12	 
		 
00:33:12	Because he drinks this.
		형은 이 피를 마시기 때문에
00:33:14	 
		 
00:33:14	This is--
		this is the only thing
		that can help me.
		이게... 이게 나를 돕는
		유일한 길이야
00:33:16	 
		 
00:33:16	Are you serious?
		지금 진심이야?
00:33:19	 
		 
00:33:19	Or are you pretending
		to fight?
		아니면 싸우는 척 하는거야?
00:33:21	 
		 
00:33:21	Because
		I can't tell if--
		만약 그렇다면...
00:33:23	 
		 
00:33:23	No, this is real.
		아니, 진짜야
00:33:25	 
		 
00:33:25	No more pretend.
		더 이상 연기하기 싫어
00:33:27	 
		 
00:33:45	Can I take you home?
		집에 데려다 줄까?
00:33:47	 
		 
00:33:49	[sniffles]
		I can't go home.
		난 집에 갈 수 없어
00:33:51	 
		 
00:33:51	Why not?
		왜?
00:33:53	 
		 
00:33:53	Because I'm scared.
		너무 무서워서
00:33:56	 
		 
00:33:57	Why are you scared?
		뭐가 무서운데?
00:33:59	 
		 
00:33:59	Caroline,
		you can talk to me.
		캐롤라인, 나한테 말해도 돼
00:34:02	 
		 
00:34:04	Katherine's going
		to be there,
		캐서린이 거기로 올꺼야
00:34:06	 
		 
00:34:06	And she's going to want me
		to tell her everything
		that happened today.
		그리고 오늘 있었던 모든 일을
		말하도록 할꺼야
00:34:11	 
		 
00:34:12	She told me
		I had to spy on you
		and report back to her.
		널 감시하고 보고하도록
		시켰어
00:34:16	 
		 
00:34:16	I know.
		알아
00:34:18	 
		 
00:34:19	And I've been
		so mad at you.
		너한테 정말 화가 났지만
00:34:21	 
		 
00:34:21	[sobs]
		 
00:34:22	 
		 
00:34:22	But then, I tried to put
		myself in your position
		너의 입장을 이해할려고 노력했어
00:34:25	 
		 
00:34:26	So that
		I could understand
		그래서 이해할 수 있었어
00:34:28	 
		 
00:34:28	Why you would do this
		to me, and to stefan,
		나에게나 스테판에게
		너가 왜 그런는지
00:34:30	 
		 
00:34:30	Because he's been
		such a friend to you.
		그는 너와 친구이기 때문에
00:34:34	 
		 
00:34:38	Who did she threaten?
		캐서린이 누굴 위협했어?
00:34:40	 
		 
00:34:40	Matt.
		[cries]
		매트
00:34:43	 
		 
00:34:43	She threatened matt.
		매트를 위협했어
00:34:46	 
		 
00:34:47	And I'm so scared of her,
		elena.
		나 너무 무서워. 엘레나
00:34:49	 
		 
00:34:49	I am so scared of her.
		캐서린이 너무 무서워
00:34:51	 
		 
00:34:51	And you should be.
		그래. 그래야돼
00:34:52	 
		 
00:34:52	Caroline,
		we all should be.
		캐롤라인, 우리 모두 그래야돼
00:34:55	 
		 
00:34:56	Why is she doing this?
		그녀는 왜 이러는거야?
00:34:58	 
		 
00:35:00	What does she want?
		도대체 뭘 원하는 거지?
00:35:02	 
		 
00:35:03	That's
		the million dollar
		question.
		아주 중요한 질문이군
00:35:05	 
		 
00:35:05	[exhales]
		 
00:35:08	 
		 
00:35:13	Hey, sheriff.
		It's mason lockwood.
		보안관님, 제 메이슨이에요
00:35:16	 
		 
00:35:16	I just want to make sure
		everything went ok today.
		오늘 모든 것이 괜찮았는지
		알고 싶어서요
00:35:18	 
		 
00:35:18	I didn't see you later,
		and...
		그 후로 볼수가 없어서요
00:35:22	 
		 
00:35:22	Give me a call,
		will you?
		전화 주세요
00:35:24	 
		 
00:35:28	Hey.
		Hey.
00:35:30	 
		 
00:35:33	I almost killed a girl
		today.
		저 오늘 어떤 애를 
		거의 죽일뻔 했어요
00:35:36	 
		 
00:35:36	What?
		뭐라고?
00:35:38	 
		 
00:35:38	It was an accident.
		I was being stupid.
		사고였어요
		내가 바보같은 짓을 해서
00:35:41	 
		 
00:35:41	She's ok, though.
		비록 그 앤 무사했지만
00:35:44	 
		 
00:35:44	But there I was.
		그런 생각이 들었어요
00:35:47	 
		 
00:35:47	You know,
		just for a moment,
		아주 잠깐
00:35:49	 
		 
00:35:49	For a split second,
		I hoped she'd die.
		아주 잠깐이지만
		개가 죽었으면 하고 말이에요
00:35:52	 
		 
00:35:52	Look, whatever this is
		inside me,
		내 안에 있는게 무엇이든지
00:35:55	 
		 
00:35:55	I don't want
		any part of it.
		그게 싫어요
00:35:56	 
		 
00:35:56	I don't ever want
		to feel that way again.
		다시는 그런 느낌이 
		들지 않았으면 좋겠어요
00:35:58	 
		 
00:35:58	I won't.
		싫어요
00:36:00	 
		 
00:36:00	I can't.
		전 할 수 없어요
00:36:02	 
		 
00:36:06	I know.
		그래 안다
00:36:08	 
		 
00:36:22	Thank you.
		고맙다
00:36:24	 
		 
00:36:25	Yeah.
		Yeah.
00:36:27	 
		 
00:36:34	[music playing]
		 
00:36:36	 
		 
00:36:44	Caroline's sleeping
		on the couch.
		캐롤라인은 소파에서 자고 있어요
00:36:46	 
		 
00:36:46	I heard.
		And you?
		알았어
		너는?
00:36:49	 
		 
00:36:50	I'm going home.
		난 집에 갈꺼에요
00:36:53	 
		 
00:36:58	What you did
		for caroline's mom...
		캐롤라인 엄마를 위해 한 일은
00:37:00	 
		 
00:37:02	That's the damon
		who was my friend.
		데이먼이 내 친구라는 뜻이에요
00:37:05	 
		 
00:37:12	Hey.
		Hey.
00:37:14	 
		 
00:37:14	Stefan didn't drink
		the people blood,
		스테판은 인간 피를 마시지 않았어
00:37:16	 
		 
00:37:16	If you were curious.
		궁금할 것 같아서
00:37:18	 
		 
00:37:18	But he needs to.
		하지만 마시는 게 필요해
00:37:21	 
		 
00:37:21	And deep down,
		you know that.
		마음 속 깊은 곳에선
		 너도 알꺼야
00:37:23	 
		 
00:37:40	You can come in.
		들어와도 돼
00:37:42	 
		 
00:37:42	Do you really think
		that you can control it?
		너가 정말 제어할 수 
		있다고 생각하는 거야?
00:37:45	 
		 
00:37:48	I don't know.
		모르겠어
00:37:50	 
		 
00:37:52	But if
		I don't try...
		그래도 해보지 않으면...
00:37:55	 
		 
00:37:57	So, a little bit
		every day?
		그래, 매일 아주 조금씩?
00:37:59	 
		 
00:38:02	Yeah,
		just a few drops
		맞아, 내 방식대로
00:38:03	 
		 
00:38:03	Of blood
		in my system.
		몇 방울만
00:38:05	 
		 
00:38:05	I think
		it's worth trying.
		해 볼 만 하다고 생각해
00:38:08	 
		 
00:38:11	So do I.
		나도
00:38:13	 
		 
00:38:14	But I don't want you
		to do it alone.
		하지만 너 혼자 
		하는 건 싫어
00:38:17	 
		 
00:38:23	What are you doing?
		뭐하는 거야?
00:38:25	 
		 
00:38:25	[gasps]
		 
00:38:26	 
		 
00:38:35	It's you and me, stefan.
		너와 나인거야, 스테판
00:38:38	 
		 
00:38:40	Always.
		항상
00:38:42	 
		 
00:39:00	[gasps]
		 
00:39:01	 
		 
00:39:02	[grunts]
		 
00:39:04	 
		 
00:39:06	[exhales]
		 
00:39:08	 
		 
00:39:49	I've been waiting.
		기다리고 있었어
00:39:51	 
		 
00:39:56	Katherine:
		Mason?
		메이슨?
00:39:57	 
		 
00:39:58	What happened?
		무슨 일이야?
00:39:59	 
		 
00:39:59	Jimmy attacked me.
		짐미가 날 공격했어
00:40:01	 
		 
00:40:01	What? Why?
		뭐? 왜?
00:40:03	 
		 
00:40:03	He said that
		I hit on marla.
		짐은 내가 마릴라랑
		바람피웠다고 생각해
00:40:05	 
		 
00:40:05	Why would he think that?
		왜 그렇게 생각하는데?
00:40:06	 
		 
00:40:06	[panting]
		 
00:40:08	 
		 
00:40:11	He's dead.
		짐은 죽었어
00:40:13	 
		 
00:40:15	I killed him.
		내가 죽였다고
00:40:17	 
		 
00:40:17	Everything's going
		to be ok.
		괜찮아, 다 잘 될꺼야
00:40:19	 
		 
00:40:22	[grunts]
		 
00:40:24	 
		 
00:40:25	Uh. What was
		that stunt today
		너 오늘 데이먼하고 스테판에게
00:40:28	 
		 
00:40:28	That you pulled with
		damon and stefan
		salvatore?
		무슨 짓을 한거야?
00:40:30	 
		 
00:40:30	I thought
		you'd be happy about that.
		난 너가 기뻐할 줄 알았어.
00:40:32	 
		 
00:40:33	I told you
		to stay away from them.
		걔들 건들지 말라고 했잖아
00:40:35	 
		 
00:40:35	Why do you even care?
		왜 그렇게 신경쓰는 거야?
00:40:36	 
		 
00:40:36	I don't want you
		to get distracted.
		난 너가 월장석을 찾는데에만
00:40:38	 
		 
00:40:38	I need you to find
		the moonstone.
		집중했으면 좋겠어
00:40:40	 
		 
00:40:44	You got it.
		너 찾았구나
00:40:46	 
		 
00:40:46	I got it.
		그래
00:40:48	 
		 
00:40:48	[chuckles]
		 
00:40:51	 
		 
00:40:52	Mmm.
		Mmm.
