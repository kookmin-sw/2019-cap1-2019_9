00:20:51	I'm just saying that maybe,
		그냥 내 말은 말야
00:20:53	 
		 
00:20:53	before you join
		the French resistance,
		프랑스 저항군에 지원하기 전에
00:20:54	 
		 
00:20:55	you walk the 15 feet
		to your neighbor's house
		15피트 떨어진 이웃집에 걸어가서
00:20:57	 
		 
00:20:57	and ask her did she get
		your damn love letter.
		얼어죽을 러브레터 받았는지 
		물어보기만 하면 됐잖아
00:20:59	 
		 
00:20:59	For someone that says that they
		don't want to talk about the movie,
		영화 얘기 하기 싫다는 사람치곤
00:21:01	 
		 
00:21:01	that's all you seem
		to be talking about.
		온통 그 얘기만 하네요
00:21:02	 
		 
00:21:02	I think it's better than putting
		this yellow mush in my mouth.
		이 노란 곤죽을 입에 넣는 것보단 낫거든
00:21:05	 
		 
00:21:05	Yeah, maybe if you opened up
		your mind,
		마음을 좀 더 열면
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:07	you would see that this
		is actually delicious.
		이게 정말로 맛있다는 것도 알 거예요
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:10	Mm-mmm!
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	It was disgusting,
		정말 최악이었어요
00:21:13	 
		 
00:21:13	but I could never let Jay know
		that he was right.
		하지만 제이가 맞았다고 할 순 없었죠
00:21:16	 
		 
00:21:16	Food wasn't terrible.
		최악까진 아니었어요
00:21:17	 
		 
00:21:17	And if I'm being honest,
		솔직히 말하면
00:21:18	 
		 
00:21:19	the movie
		sort of stayed with me.
		영화도 꽤나 인상깊었어요
