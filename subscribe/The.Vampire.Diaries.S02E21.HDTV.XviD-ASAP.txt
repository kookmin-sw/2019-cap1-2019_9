00:00:00	Previously
		on "the vampire diaries"...
		뱀파이어 다이어리
		지난 이야기
00:00:01	 
		 
00:00:01	- You must be Elena.
		- How do we look exactly alike?
		- 네가 엘레나구나
		- 어떻게 똑같이 생긴거지?
00:00:04	 
		 
00:00:04	You're a Petrova doppelganger.
		넌 페트로바 도플갱어야
00:00:05	 
		 
00:00:05	You're the key to
		breaking the curse.
		저주를 깨는 열쇠지
00:00:07	 
		 
00:00:07	Klaus is a vampire
		born of a werewolf bloodline.
		클라우스는 늑대인간의
		혈통에서 태어났어
00:00:09	 
		 
00:00:09	The curse has kept his werewolf
		aspect from manifesting.
		저주가 늑대인간의 면을
		막고 있었던 거지
00:00:11	 
		 
00:00:11	But if he breaks it,
		he'll be a true hybrid.
		하지만 저주가 깨지면
		정말로 잡종이 되는거고
00:00:14	 
		 
00:00:14	Klaus wanted me
		to deliver a message.
		클라우스가 메세지를
		전달하랬어
00:00:15	 
		 
00:00:15	The sacrifice happens tonight.
		의식은 오늘 일어나
00:00:17	 
		 
00:00:17	The ritual itself is
		relatively straight forward.
		의식 자체는 간단해
00:00:19	 
		 
00:00:19	A witch will channel the
		power of the Full Moon
		마녀가 월장석에 걸린
		주문을 해제하려고
00:00:21	 
		 
00:00:21	to release the spell that's
		bound within the stone.
		보름달로부터
		힘을 끌어낼거야
00:00:24	 
		 
00:00:24	After that, Klaus, being
		both werewolf and vampire,
		그 다음, 뱀파이어이자
		늑대인간인 클라우스가
00:00:27	 
		 
00:00:27	will sacrifice one of each.
		각각 하나씩 제물로 바칠거야
00:00:28	 
		 
00:00:28	- And where do I fit into it?
		- Klaus must drink
		- 저는 언제 필요한거죠?
		- 클라우스는 
00:00:30	 
		 
00:00:30	the blood of the doppelganger
		반드시 도플갱어의
		피를 마셔야 해
00:00:31	 
		 
00:00:31	to the point of your death.
		네가 죽을 때 까지
00:00:32	 
		 
00:00:32	- I can't lose you.
		- You won't.
		- 널 잃고싶지 않아
		- 잃지 않을 거에요
00:00:34	 
		 
00:00:34	- There is another way.
		- Damon, no!
		- 다른 방법도 있지
		- 데이먼, 안돼요!
00:00:36	 
		 
00:00:36	She'll come back a vampire! How could
		you take that choice away from her?
		뱀파이어가 될거라고!
		어떻게 그럴 수 있어?
00:00:39	 
		 
00:00:39	She'll never forgive you.
		엘레나는 널 절대
		용서하지 않을 거야
00:00:40	 
		 
00:00:40	A bite from a werewolf
		can kill a vampire.
		늑대인간에게 물리면
		뱀파이어는 죽어
00:00:42	 
		 
00:00:42	So don't be his friend.
		Do you understand me?
		그러니 걔랑 친하게
		지내지 마, 알아 들어?
00:00:43	 
		 
00:00:44	 
		　
00:00:46	 
		 
00:00:48	Tyler?
		타일러?
00:00:50	 
		 
00:00:50	Without the werewolf, he can't
		perform the ritual tonight.
		늑대인간 없이
		의식을 치를 순 없으니까
00:00:53	 
		 
00:00:53	First rule always...
		have a back up.
		첫 번째 룰...
		항상 여분을 둬라
00:00:55	 
		 
00:00:55	Back up werewolf...
		Back up vampire.
		- 여분의 늑대인간...
		- 여분의 뱀파이어
00:00:58	 
		 
00:00:58	She's in transition.
		변이 중이지
00:00:59	 
		 
00:00:59	- Why didn't he use me?
		- He couldn't.
		- 왜 날 안 쓴 거지?
		- 쓸 수 없었어!
00:01:01	 
		 
00:01:01	- What is this, Damon?
		- A werewolf bite.
		- 이게 뭐야, 데이먼?
		- 늑대인간한테 물린 자국
00:01:05	 
		 
00:01:05	 
		　
00:01:08	 
		 
00:01:08	- Caroline, let me help!
		- Get back, I got it!
		- 캐롤라인, 도와줘!
		- 물러나, 내가 할게
00:01:10	 
		 
00:01:10	Oh! God!
		　
00:01:12	 
		 
00:01:13	 
		　
00:01:16	 
		 
00:01:18	 
		　
00:01:19	 
		 
00:01:19	Caroline, the door's
		not going to hold.
		캐롤라인, 문이
		버티질 못할 거야
00:01:22	 
		 
00:01:22	- Come on!
		- Tyler, please!
		- 뒤로 와!
		- 타일러, 제발!
00:01:23	 
		 
00:01:24	 
		　
00:01:25	 
		 
00:01:25	Matt! No, hey, no!
		It's Tyler!
		맷! 안돼!
		타일러라고!
00:01:28	 
		 
00:01:28	- It's trying to kill us!
		- Wait!
		- 우릴 죽이려고 하잖아!
		- 기다려
00:01:30	 
		 
00:01:31	 
		　
00:01:32	 
		 
00:01:32	- He's wounded.
		- Caroline, stay back.
		- 다쳤나봐
		- 캐롤라인, 물러서
00:01:34	 
		 
00:01:34	- We can go around him.
		- Are you nuts?
		- 다가가도 될거야
		- 정신 나갔니?
00:01:37	 
		 
00:01:38	You're not going to
		shoot him again, ok? - Ok.
		쏘면 안돼, 알았지?
00:01:40	 
		 
00:01:40	Matt, take my hand.
		맷, 내 손 잡아
00:01:42	 
		 
00:01:42	I got it.
		괜찮아
00:01:44	 
		 
00:01:44	Matt, take my hand.
		맷, 내 손 잡아
00:01:45	 
		 
00:01:51	So that's what
		a werewolf bite looks like.
		이게 바로 늑대인간한테
		물린 자국이군
00:01:53	 
		 
00:01:53	- Yep.
		- It's not that bad.
		- 응
		- 그렇게 나빠 보이진 않네
00:01:55	 
		 
00:01:56	Will be.
		곧 그렇게 될거야
00:01:57	 
		 
00:01:57	So that's it?
		그게 다야?
00:01:59	 
		 
00:01:59	You're just... going to die?
		그냥... 죽는 거야?
00:02:01	 
		 
00:02:01	Well, that depends.
		You know anything about a cure?
		그거야 모르지
		치료법 아는거 있어?
00:02:03	 
		 
00:02:05	Me, either.
		나도야
00:02:07	 
		 
00:02:10	145 years
		and no last good-bye?
		145년이나 알고 지냈는데
		마지막 작별인사도 없어?
00:02:14	 
		 
00:02:14	You don't get
		a good-bye.
		넌 그럴 자격 없어
00:02:16	 
		 
00:02:16	No. Don't leave mad.
		아니, 그렇게 떠나지 마
00:02:19	 
		 
00:02:19	Us ending on up on good terms isn't
		exactly on my bucket list, Katherine.
		우리 좋게 끝나는 게 내
		죽기 전 할 일 목록에 없거든?
00:02:22	 
		 
00:02:22	Klaus made me call Jenna
		to lure her out.
		클라우스가 제나를 
		끌어내라고 시킨거야
00:02:24	 
		 
00:02:24	There was nothing that I could do.
		I didn't have a choice.
		어쩔 수가 없었어
		선택권이 없었다고
00:02:26	 
		 
00:02:26	That's why I gave you the vervain.
		So you had a choice.
		그래서 내가 마편초를 줬잖아
		선택권은 있었어
00:02:28	 
		 
00:02:28	It was her or me.
		I chose her.
		나 아니면 제나였어
		난 제나를 택했지
00:02:31	 
		 
00:02:31	I helped you.
		You owed me.
		널 도와줬잖아
		나한테 신세졌지
00:02:33	 
		 
00:02:33	Now when Klaus dies, you're
		going to walk out of here
		이제 클라우스가 죽으면
		넌 여기서 상처 하나 없이
00:02:34	 
		 
00:02:34	without a scratch
		and Elena's aunt dies.
		빠져나갈 거고
		엘레나 이모는 죽겠지
00:02:36	 
		 
00:02:36	Somehow you're
		the only one that wins.
		어쩌다 네가 
		유일한 승자가 됐네
00:02:39	 
		 
00:02:39	How'd that happen?
		어떻게 그렇게 된거지?
00:02:40	 
		 
00:02:40	I didn't let love
		get in the way.
		사랑을 버렸으니까
00:02:43	 
		 
00:02:43	Enjoy eternity alone,
		Katherine.
		평생 혼자서 
		잘 지내봐, 캐서린
00:02:47	 
		 
00:02:47	What are you going to do?
		뭘 어쩔거야?
00:02:50	 
		 
00:02:50	I'm going to offer myself
		as a replacement to Klaus.
		클라우스한테 
		내 몸을 바칠 거야
00:02:53	 
		 
00:02:53	He won't take you.
		널 쓰지 않을 거야
00:02:55	 
		 
00:02:55	He saw your bite, he said
		that your blood is impure.
		네 자국을 봤어
		네 피가 깨끗하지 않댔어
00:02:58	 
		 
00:02:58	I'm sorry, Damon.
		미안해, 데이먼
00:03:01	 
		 
00:03:01	But Jenna's dead, there's
		nothing you can do about it.
		하지만 제나는 죽을 거고
		네가 할 수 있는 건 없어
00:03:03	 
		 
00:03:08	Oh, my head.
		아, 머리야
00:03:11	 
		 
00:03:11	What's wrong with me?
		왜 이런 거지?
00:03:12	 
		 
00:03:12	Do you remember what happened?
		무슨 일인지 기억해?
00:03:13	 
		 
00:03:13	You called me.
		네가 전화했잖아
00:03:16	 
		 
00:03:16	You were so scared.
		두려움에 떨고선
00:03:18	 
		 
00:03:18	Oh, ah, I should have
		realized that it wasn't you.
		네가 아니란 걸
		알아챘어야 했는데
00:03:23	 
		 
00:03:23	The second I walked out of the
		house, someone grabbed me.
		집 밖으로 나왔는데
		누가 날 잡았어
00:03:26	 
		 
00:03:26	- A vampire.
		- Klaus.
		- 뱀파이어가
		- 클라우스야
00:03:29	 
		 
00:03:29	It was Klaus.
		클라우스였어
00:03:31	 
		 
00:03:31	He made me drink his blood.
		자기 피를 마시게 했어
00:03:33	 
		 
00:03:33	And I don't...
		그리고 난...
00:03:36	 
		 
00:03:36	I don't remember
		anything after that.
		그 이후 일은
		기억이 안나
00:03:38	 
		 
00:03:38	Where are we?
		What happened?
		여긴 어디야?
		무슨 일이지?
00:03:41	 
		 
00:03:41	We're at the quarry.
		He brought us here.
		채석장이야 
		클라우스가 데리고 왔어
00:03:43	 
		 
00:03:43	Why don't I remember anything?
		왜 아무것도 기억이
		안 나는 거지?
00:03:45	 
		 
00:03:46	Jenna, do you remember...
		이모, 혹시 기억해?
00:03:48	 
		 
00:03:49	When I told you how someone
		becomes a vampire?
		누군가 뱀파이어가 되면
		어떻게 되는지?
00:03:52	 
		 
00:03:52	Yeah, if you die with vampire
		blood in your system,
		응, 뱀파이어의 피를
		마시고 죽게 되면...
00:03:54	 
		 
00:03:54	it's...
		　
00:03:56	 
		 
00:03:57	Oh, God.
		세상에
00:04:00	 
		 
00:04:01	- He killed me.
		- Jenna, listen to me.
		- 날 죽였구나
		- 이모, 잘 들어
00:04:03	 
		 
00:04:03	Listen to me, everything's
		going to be ok.
		모든 게 괜찮을 거야
00:04:05	 
		 
00:04:05	I'm going to get you
		out of here.
		내가 여기서 꺼내줄게
00:04:06	 
		 
00:04:06	I'm a vampire?
		내가 뱀파이어야?
00:04:08	 
		 
00:04:09	And I bet
		you're hungry.
		그리고 배가 고플테지
00:04:12	 
		 
00:04:18	 
		　
00:04:19	 
		 
00:04:24	 
		　
00:04:26	 
		 
00:04:26	Don't bother
		trying to get through.
		나오려고 하지마
00:04:27	 
		 
00:04:27	I spelled the circle.
		You're trapped.
		내가 주문을 걸었어
		넌 갇힌거야
00:04:31	 
		 
00:04:31	- No matter what you do.
		- Greta...
		- 무슨 짓을 하든
		- 그레타
00:04:33	 
		 
00:04:33	Please, just...
		just let her go.
		제발, 그냥...
		이모를 보내줘
00:04:36	 
		 
00:04:40	Klaus chose her.
		클라우스가 선택한 거야
00:04:42	 
		 
00:04:44	Drink it.
		마셔
00:04:45	 
		 
00:04:45	Jenna, don't!
		이모, 하지마!
00:04:47	 
		 
00:04:47	I can't.
		Let her go. Hey!
		- 거부를 못하겠어
		- 풀어줘
00:04:50	 
		 
00:04:53	No!
		안돼!
00:04:55	 
		 
00:04:55	 
		　
00:04:57	 
		 
00:05:03	 
		　
00:05:04	 
		 
00:05:10	That's enough.
		그거면 됐어
00:05:12	 
		 
00:05:12	Jenna...
		이모...
00:05:13	 
		 
00:05:14	It's going to be ok.
		괜찮을 거야
00:05:16	 
		 
00:05:22	Look at me.
		Hey, look at me.
		이모, 날 봐
		날 봐
00:05:26	 
		 
00:05:26	It's gonna be ok.
		It's gonna be ok.
		괜찮을 거야
00:05:29	 
		 
00:05:29	No.
		안돼

00:05:39	This is useless.
		이건 쓸모없네
00:05:42	 
		 
00:05:42	All these grimoires.
		여기 모든
		주문서 중에
00:05:43	 
		 
00:05:43	There has to be something
		in here to keep Elena
		하나라도 누나를
		뱀파이어가 안되게 하는
00:05:45	 
		 
00:05:45	from becoming a vampire.
		방법이 있어야 하잖아
00:05:47	 
		 
00:05:47	And we'll keep looking.
		계속 찾아보자
00:05:49	 
		 
00:05:49	Until the last minute.
		최후의 순간까지
00:05:51	 
		 
00:05:53	The sacrifice is completed
		in stages as the Full Moon sets.
		보름달이 뜨면 의식의
		일부는 완료가 돼
00:05:57	 
		 
00:05:57	First the werewolf is killed,
		then the vampire.
		먼저 늑대인간이 죽고
		다음이 뱀파이어
00:05:59	 
		 
00:05:59	Finally the doppelganger.
		마지막이 도플갱어지
00:06:01	 
		 
00:06:01	Once Elena dies,
		the curse will be broken.
		엘레나가 죽으면
		저주는 깨질 거야
00:06:03	 
		 
00:06:03	- Klaus will become hybrid.
		- So when do we attack?
		- 클라우스가 잡종이 되는 거지
		- 우린 언제 공격하죠?
00:06:05	 
		 
00:06:05	Elena's death will activate
		his dormant werewolf side.
		엘레나의 죽음이 잠들은
		늑대인간의 면을 끌어낼 거야
00:06:08	 
		 
00:06:09	He'll be vulnerable
		during the transformation.
		변이 중에 
		약해질 거고
00:06:10	 
		 
00:06:10	That's when Bonnie comes in.
		그 때 보니가
		오는거지
00:06:12	 
		 
00:06:12	And you're sure Bonnie
		will survive this?
		보니가 살아남을
		거라고 확신해요?
00:06:14	 
		 
00:06:14	If she can deliver him
		to the brink of death,
		보니가 클라우스를 죽기
		직전까지 몰아 붙이면
00:06:15	 
		 
00:06:15	I'll finish the job myself.
		내가 직접 끝낼 거야
00:06:18	 
		 
00:06:18	Damon.
		데이먼
00:06:20	 
		 
00:06:20	You're not going to like
		what I'm about to say.
		이런 말 듣기 
		싫겠지만
00:06:21	 
		 
00:06:21	- Cut to the chase.
		- Is the sacrifice happening or not?
		본론만 말해
		의식 중이야?
00:06:24	 
		 
00:06:24	It's happening.
		응
00:06:25	 
		 
00:06:25	I tried to stop it,
		but it got... complicated.
		멈추려 했는데
		좀... 복잡해졌어
00:06:28	 
		 
00:06:28	We're sticking with
		the original plan.
		우린 지금 형 처음
		계획대로 하고 있어
00:06:30	 
		 
00:06:30	We're meeting Bonnie right now.
		지금 보니 만나러 
		가는 길이야
00:06:32	 
		 
00:06:32	He's got Jenna, Stefan.
		제나를 데려갔어, 스테판
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	What?
		뭐라고?
00:06:34	 
		 
00:06:34	He got **** to lure her
		out of the house.
		캐서린한테 제나를
		끌어내도록 시켰어
00:06:36	 
		 
00:06:38	What is it?
		What's wrong?
		무슨 일이야?
		뭐가 문제야?
00:06:42	 
		 
00:06:42	He's going to use her
		as the vampire in the ritual.
		제나를 의식에서
		제물로 쓸 생각이야
00:06:44	 
		 
00:06:44	Oh, my God.
		그럴 수가
00:06:47	 
		 
00:06:48	How
		are you feeling?
		기분은 좀 어때?
00:06:49	 
		 
00:06:49	I feel like myself...
		Only not.
		괜찮아...
		아마도
00:06:53	 
		 
00:06:54	Everything is brighter.
		모든게 더 
		밝게 보이고
00:06:56	 
		 
00:06:57	The fire's hotter.
		불은 더 뜨겁고
00:06:58	 
		 
00:06:59	Part of me is terrified,
		겁도 나고
00:07:00	 
		 
00:07:00	but there's another part of me that
		doesn't want to feel anything.
		아무 것도 느끼지 않고
		싶다는 느낌도 있어
00:07:04	 
		 
00:07:04	Vampires can turn off
		the part that's human.
		뱀파이어는 인간적인
		면을 끌 수 있어
00:07:07	 
		 
00:07:08	That's the part that hurts.
		그래서 아픈거야
00:07:09	 
		 
00:07:09	I'm gonna die, aren't I?
		난 죽을거야, 그렇지?
00:07:12	 
		 
00:07:12	No!
		아니!
00:07:15	 
		 
00:07:15	Jenna, I'm not going
		to let that happen.
		이모, 그렇게 
		둘 순 없어
00:07:17	 
		 
00:07:17	I don't care what I have to do.
		내가 뭘 해야
		하던지 간에
00:07:19	 
		 
00:07:19	 
		　
00:07:21	 
		 
00:07:21	Who's that?
		누구야?
00:07:23	 
		 
00:07:23	That must be the werewolf.
		늑대인간이야
00:07:24	 
		 
00:07:24	 
		　
00:07:27	 
		 
00:07:28	What's happening to me?
		무슨 일이지?
00:07:29	 
		 
00:07:29	I cast a spell to slow down
		your transformation.
		내가 네 변이를 
		늦추는 주문을 걸었지
00:07:32	 
		 
00:07:32	Your insides are trying
		to tear themselves free.
		네 안에선 주문을
		거부하고 있는 거고
00:07:37	 
		 
00:07:41	Greta, witches are supposed to
		maintain the balance in nature.
		그레타, 마녀들은 원래
		자연의 균형을 지켜야 하잖아
00:07:44	 
		 
00:07:44	It's your duty to them to
		keep your curse sealed.
		저주가 풀리지 않도록
		지키는 게 네 임무야
00:07:47	 
		 
00:07:47	My duty is to Klaus!
		내 임무는 클라우스를
		위하는 거야!
00:07:49	 
		 
00:07:49	The new order.
		새로운 명령이지
00:07:52	 
		 
00:07:52	Glad to know I still have
		a dance partner.
		아직 춤 상대가 있다니
		기분이 좋은 걸?
00:07:56	 
		 
00:07:59	Hello, my lovelies.
		안녕, 내 예쁜이들
00:08:01	 
		 
00:08:01	Are we ready?
		준비 되셨어?
00:08:04	 
		 
00:08:04	Come on... get in here!
		어서, 들어와
00:08:06	 
		 
00:08:08	 
		　
00:08:10	 
		 
00:08:10	Do you see anything?
		보이는 거 있어?
00:08:11	 
		 
00:08:11	We're not
		safe here.
		여긴 안전하지 않아
00:08:12	 
		 
00:08:12	If that thing wants
		in, it's getting in.
		들어오려고 하면
		충분히 그럴 수 있어
00:08:15	 
		 
00:08:18	How did you even know
		what I was?
		내가 뱀파이어인지
		어떻게 안거야?
00:08:21	 
		 
00:08:21	I compelled you to forget!
		내가 주문을 걸었는데!
00:08:23	 
		 
00:08:23	I was on vervain.
		마편초를 마셨어
00:08:25	 
		 
00:08:25	I faked forgetting
		so I could spy on you.
		잊은 척 하고
		널 염탐한거야
00:08:28	 
		 
00:08:28	It was your mom's idea.
		네 엄마 아이디어였어
00:08:30	 
		 
00:08:30	Wait, my mom knows?!
		잠깐, 엄마가 안다고?
00:08:31	 
		 
00:08:31	Oh, my God!
		You told her.
		세상에
		네가 말했구나
00:08:34	 
		 
00:08:34	Well, what'd she say?
		엄마가 뭐래?
00:08:35	 
		 
00:08:35	Your mom hates vampires.
		She grew up hating vampires.
		뱀파이어를 증오하셔
		그렇게 자라셨지
00:08:40	 
		 
00:08:40	She'll probably
		always hate vampires.
		아마 계속 뱀파이어를
		증오하실 거야
00:08:43	 
		 
00:08:43	Well, what about you?
		넌 어때?
00:08:45	 
		 
00:08:45	What about me?
		난 어떠냐고?
00:08:46	 
		 
00:08:46	Where does this leave us?
		그럼 우린 뭐지?
00:08:49	 
		 
00:08:50	Stuck in this house.
		이 집에 갇힌거지
00:08:52	 
		 
00:08:52	Trying not to get mauled
		to death by our friend.
		우리 친구한테
		안 맞아 죽으려고 말야
00:08:54	 
		 
00:08:55	 
		　
00:08:57	 
		 
00:08:58	Heard ya.
		살살 좀 쳐요
00:09:00	 
		 
00:09:00	 
		　
00:09:02	 
		 
00:09:16	Great. I was just thinking
		about getting a bite to eat.
		잘됐군, 누구든 물어
		뜯으려던 참이었는데 말야
00:09:19	 
		 
00:09:19	Elena hasn't returned
		any of my calls for days.
		엘레나가 며칠간
		전화를 받질 않아
00:09:21	 
		 
00:09:21	I need to see her.
		좀 만나야 겠어
00:09:22	 
		 
00:09:22	Well, you're a day late
		and a daughter short, John.
		그게, 네가 좀 늦어서
		따님께서 없네, 존
00:09:25	 
		 
00:09:25	What are you talking about?
		무슨 소리야?
00:09:26	 
		 
00:09:26	Klaus has her.
		Sacrifice goes down tonight.
		클라우스가 데리고 있어
		오늘 의식이 행해져
00:09:29	 
		 
00:09:29	How could you let that happen?
		어떻게 그렇게
		둘 수 있어?
00:09:30	 
		 
00:09:30	You were supposed
		to keep her safe.
		엘레나를 지켰어야지
00:09:32	 
		 
00:09:32	Wasn't that the sum total of
		your plan; To keep her safe?
		엘레나를 지키는 게
		네 계획 아니었나?
00:09:35	 
		 
00:09:35	She is safe.
		I fed her my blood.
		엘레나는 안전해
		내 피를 먹였어
00:09:37	 
		 
00:09:37	- You what?!
		- When Klaus kills Elena
		- 뭘 했다고?
		- 클라우스가 의식 중
00:09:39	 
		 
00:09:39	in the sacrifice,
		she will come back to life.
		엘레나를 죽이면
		다시 살아 돌아올 거야
00:09:41	 
		 
00:09:41	Granted, as the thing
		you hate most in the world,
		네가 세상에서 가장
		증오하는 존재로 말야
00:09:42	 
		 
00:09:42	but no one really
		cares what you think.
		하지만 네 생각 따위
		아무도 신경 안 쓰지
00:09:45	 
		 
00:09:48	You do not want to mess
		with me right now.
		지금 이러고
		싶지 않을텐데
00:09:51	 
		 
00:09:51	You ruined her life.
		You know that, right?
		네가 걔 인생을 망쳤어
		알고 있지?
00:09:53	 
		 
00:09:54	I know, John.
		알지, 존
00:09:55	 
		 
00:09:55	I took her choice,
		destroyed her future.
		선택권도 빼앗았고
		걔 미래도 부쉈지
00:09:56	 
		 
00:09:56	Trust me, I get it.
		정말이야
		알고 있어
00:09:59	 
		 
00:09:59	It actually gets worse.
		더 안 좋아 질 거야
00:10:01	 
		 
00:10:01	How could it possibly
		get any worse?
		여기서 어떻게 더
		나빠진다는 거야?
00:10:05	 
		 
00:10:07	 
		　
00:10:08	 
		 
00:10:09	I got the moonstone.
		월장석을 얻었어
00:10:11	 
		 
00:10:12	I spent 500 years
		looking for this.
		이걸 찾느라
		500년을 보냈지
00:10:16	 
		 
00:10:17	I hate to part with it.
		주기 싫군
00:10:20	 
		 
00:10:25	The Moon has passed its apex.
		달이 정점을 지났어
00:10:28	 
		 
00:10:28	Remember everything
		you need to do?
		어떻게 해야
		하는지 기억해?
00:10:30	 
		 
00:10:30	I remember.
		기억하고 말고
00:10:32	 
		 
00:10:35	 
		　
00:10:37	 
		 
00:10:41	 
		　
00:10:43	 
		 
00:10:45	Everything I did...
		내가 한 행동들...
00:10:48	 
		 
00:10:48	I was just trying
		to help Tyler.
		난 그냥 타일러를
		도우려고 한거야
00:10:50	 
		 
00:10:50	Are you Jules?
		줄스에요?
00:10:52	 
		 
00:10:52	I didn't want him to be alone!
		타일러가 혼자가
		되는 게 싫었어
00:10:55	 
		 
00:10:55	 
		　
00:10:57	 
		 
00:10:58	Shall we?
		해 보실까?
00:11:00	 
		 
00:11:00	 
		　
00:11:03	 
		 
00:11:13	 
		　
00:11:16	 
		 
00:11:25	 
		　
00:11:27	 
		 
00:11:32	***** reading.
		뭐 읽고 있어?
00:11:33	 
		 
00:11:33	Emily Bennett's has a section
		on spells she did
		에밀리 베넷이 내 조상
		조나단 길버트를 위해
00:11:35	 
		 
00:11:35	for my ancestor
		Johnathan Gilbert.
		걸었던 주문에
		관한 내용이야
00:11:37	 
		 
00:11:37	Yeah, I think she
		had a thing for him.
		응, 내 생각엔
		좀 좋아했나봐
00:11:40	 
		 
00:11:43	There's something on a resuscitative
		spell she was working on.
		에밀리가 공을 들이던
		부활의 주문에 관한 거야
00:11:46	 
		 
00:11:46	I saw that, too.
		나도 그건 봤어
00:11:47	 
		 
00:11:47	She just didn't explain
		what it did, exactly.
		하지만 정확히 어떻게
		됐는지 설명이 없어
00:11:50	 
		 
00:11:50	Maybe Johnathan wrote
		about it in his journals.
		조나단의 일기장에
		적혀 있을지도 몰라
00:11:52	 
		 
00:11:52	You know, I can have
		Stefan bring them.
		스테판 형보고 
		가져오라 할게
00:11:54	 
		 
00:11:54	 
		　
00:11:55	 
		 
00:11:55	Someone's here.
		누가 왔어
00:11:57	 
		 
00:12:01	Hey, what are you doing here?
		여기서 뭐하는 거에요?
00:12:03	 
		 
00:12:03	Elijah and Stefan are upstairs.
		일라이자랑 스테판이
		위에 있어
00:12:06	 
		 
00:12:06	You mind if I have a
		second with Jeremy?
		제레미랑 잠깐
		할 얘기가 있는데?
00:12:08	 
		 
00:12:08	Sure, yeah.
		Of course.
		그럼요
		알았어요
00:12:10	 
		 
00:12:15	What's the matter?
		무슨 일이에요?
00:12:16	 
		 
00:12:16	Jeremy...
		제레미
00:12:18	 
		 
00:12:18	Something's happened to Jenna.
		제나한테 일이 생겼어
00:12:21	 
		 
00:12:24	Why did he take Jenna?
		왜 제나 이모를 
		데리고 간 거에요?
00:12:25	 
		 
00:12:25	A punishment for meddling.
		방해한 벌이지
00:12:27	 
		 
00:12:27	Klaus was going to use
		Tyler and Caroline.
		타일러랑 캐롤라인을
		쓰려고 했는데
00:12:29	 
		 
00:12:30	- But Damon rescued them.
		- Then we need to go.
		- 데이먼이 구했어
		- 그럼 가야지!
00:12:32	 
		 
00:12:32	Now. Before Jenna's
		been sacrificed.
		지금. 제나 이모가 
		희생당하기 전에
00:12:34	 
		 
00:12:34	- I can kill Klaus myself.
		- Bonnie...
		- 나 혼자 죽일 수 있어
		- 보니...
00:12:36	 
		 
00:12:36	If you use that much
		power, you'll be dead.
		그렇게 많은 힘을 쓰면
		죽게 될 거야
00:12:38	 
		 
00:12:38	We've already
		been through this.
		벌써 끝난 얘기잖아
00:12:39	 
		 
00:12:39	It's not an option.
		선택할 수 있는게 아냐
00:12:41	 
		 
00:12:41	Neither is letting Jenna die.
		제나 이모를 죽게 
		두는 것도 마찬가지야
00:12:42	 
		 
00:12:43	Well, Stefan would
		agree with you.
		스테판도 네 말에
		동의할 거야
00:12:45	 
		 
00:12:47	We're going to offer
		another vampire.
		다른 뱀파이어를
		주기로 했어
00:12:50	 
		 
00:12:50	One that he'll want more.
		그가 더 원할만한 거지
00:12:52	 
		 
00:12:53	Me.
		나
00:12:55	 
		 
00:13:06	Tell me it's working.
		제대로 되고 있는거지?
00:13:08	 
		 
00:13:09	It's working.
		응
00:13:11	 
		 
00:13:16	The day that the lawyers called
		to tell me that I was going
		변호사들이 내가
		네 보호자가 될 거라고
00:13:19	 
		 
00:13:19	to become your guardian,
		you know what my first thought was?
		전화 했을 때 처음에
		든 생각이 뭔 줄 아니?
00:13:21	 
		 
00:13:22	Isn't there someone else
		who can do this?
		다른 사람 없어요?
00:13:25	 
		 
00:13:25	Jenna, there was no one else
		이모, 제레미랑 나를
00:13:27	 
		 
00:13:27	who could have gotten me and
		Jeremy through all of that.
		이렇게 키워 줄 
		사람은 아무도 없었어
00:13:29	 
		 
00:13:29	It's just the thought that I almost
		passed up taking care of you.
		너희를 거절하려고
		생각도 했었지
00:13:32	 
		 
00:13:32	But you didn't.
		하지만 그러지 않았잖아
00:13:34	 
		 
00:13:34	You put your entire life
		우리를 도우려고
00:13:35	 
		 
00:13:35	on hold to help us.
		이모 인생을 바쳤잖아
00:13:37	 
		 
00:13:37	Look around, Elena.
		둘러봐, 엘레나
00:13:42	 
		 
00:13:42	- I failed you.
		- No.
		- 내가 널 망쳤어
		- 아냐
00:13:43	 
		 
00:13:43	You didn't.
		I failed you.
		아니야
		내가 그랬지
00:13:47	 
		 
00:13:50	I'm so sorry.
		정말 미안해
00:13:52	 
		 
00:13:54	Listen.
		들어봐
00:13:55	 
		 
00:13:55	Being a vampire, it
		intensifies your guilt.
		뱀파이어가 되면
		죄 의식을 크게 느껴
00:13:58	 
		 
00:13:58	But it also makes you
		stronger and faster.
		또한 더 강하고
		빠르게 만들지
00:14:01	 
		 
00:14:01	You can fight back.
		맞서 싸울 수 있어
00:14:03	 
		 
00:14:03	I'm gonna get through this.
		I'll be ok.
		난 이겨낼 거야
		난 괜찮을 거야
00:14:05	 
		 
00:14:05	I need you to believe that.
		이모가 그걸 믿어줘
00:14:07	 
		 
00:14:08	Promise me,
		약속해줘
00:14:10	 
		 
00:14:11	when you get the chance...
		기회가 생기면
00:14:13	 
		 
00:14:15	Run.
		도망쳐
00:14:17	 
		 
00:14:18	Ok.
		알았어
00:14:20	 
		 
00:14:21	You don't think
		I killed him, do you?
		내가 걜 죽인거야?
00:14:23	 
		 
00:14:23	No.
		아니
00:14:24	 
		 
00:14:24	No. It takes a lot more
		than wooden bullets
		아냐, 겨우 나무
		총알 가지고는
00:14:26	 
		 
00:14:26	to kill a werewolf.
		늑대인간을
		죽일 수 없어
00:14:29	 
		 
00:14:29	He's still out there somewhere.
		아직 밖에 있을거야
00:14:33	 
		 
00:14:36	Do you think my mom
		wants to kill me?
		우리 엄마가 날
		죽이고 싶어할까?
00:14:38	 
		 
00:14:39	I don't think your mom
		knows what to do with you.
		널 어떻게 해야할 지
		모르시는 것 겉아
00:14:42	 
		 
00:14:42	Yeah, well, I don't really know
		what to do with me, either.
		그래, 나도 날 어떻게
		해야할 지 모르겠으니까
00:14:46	 
		 
00:14:48	 
		　
00:14:49	 
		 
00:14:49	What is it?
		뭐야?
00:14:50	 
		 
00:14:50	Wait.
		기다려
00:14:52	 
		 
00:14:52	 
		　
00:14:53	 
		 
00:14:54	Don't! Don't shoot.
		쏘지마
00:14:56	 
		 
00:14:56	What the hell are you doing?
		대체 뭐 하는 거야?
00:14:57	 
		 
00:15:01	- Give me your jacket.
		- What?
		- 자켓 이리줘
		- 뭐?
00:15:03	 
		 
00:15:03	Your jacket, take it off.
		네 자켓, 이리 줘 봐
00:15:05	 
		 
00:15:10	Hey.
		　
00:15:13	 
		 
00:15:14	Hey.
		타일러
00:15:16	 
		 
00:15:16	 
		　
00:15:19	 
		 
00:15:19	Caroline.
		캐롤라인
00:15:22	 
		 
00:15:36	Bonnie did
		a locator spell.
		보니가 추적 
		마법을 썼어
00:15:37	 
		 
00:15:37	They're at Steven's quarry.
		스티븐 채석장에 있어
00:15:39	 
		 
00:15:39	I'll head over there first and you'll
		follow with Bonnie when it's time.
		제가 먼저 갈테니 때가
		되면 보니랑 같이 오세요
00:15:42	 
		 
00:15:42	Just as the Moon
		hits its final phase.
		달이 정점에
		닿을 때 까지
00:15:43	 
		 
00:15:43	She's to stay
		hidden until then.
		숨어 있어야 해
00:15:46	 
		 
00:15:46	He cannot know
		that she's alive.
		보니가 살아있다는 걸
		알아서는 안돼
00:15:48	 
		 
00:15:52	You're very honorable.
		넌 참 명예롭군
00:15:54	 
		 
00:15:58	Are you?
		당신은요?
00:15:59	 
		 
00:16:03	Because this whole plan is, um,
		왜냐하면 이 모든 게획이
00:16:05	 
		 
00:16:06	it's contingent upon
		your honor, Elijah.
		당신의 명예에
		달린 거잖아요, 일라이자
00:16:10	 
		 
00:16:10	I won't fail you.
		널 실망시키지 않으마
00:16:12	 
		 
00:16:13	Klaus is your brother.
		클라우스는 당신 형이죠
00:16:14	 
		 
00:16:15	I know I've wanted to kill
		my brother a thousand times.
		나도 형을 수천 번이나
		죽이고 싶었죠
00:16:20	 
		 
00:16:21	I've never been able to.
		하지만 할 수 없었어요
00:16:22	 
		 
00:16:23	Well, Klaus was not
		my only brother.
		클라우스는 내 유일한
		형이 아니었어
00:16:25	 
		 
00:16:27	I had siblings;
		난 형제가 있었지
00:16:28	 
		 
00:16:28	Parents.
		I had a family.
		부모님도
		가족이 있었어
00:16:31	 
		 
00:16:31	Over the centuries, Klaus
		hunted them down one by one
		수 세기 동안, 클라우스는
		한 명씩 찾아내서
00:16:34	 
		 
00:16:34	and he took them from me.
		나한테서 앗아갔지
00:16:36	 
		 
00:16:38	He scattered them
		across the seas
		그리곤 시체가
		발견될 수 없도록
00:16:39	 
		 
00:16:40	where their bodies
		couldn't be found.
		바다로 던져버렸어
00:16:42	 
		 
00:16:44	You want revenge.
		복수를 원하는군요
00:16:46	 
		 
00:16:48	Sometimes there's honor
		in revenge, Stefan.
		가끔은 복수에도
		명예가 있는거야, 스테판
00:16:51	 
		 
00:16:54	I won't fail you.
		널 실망시키지 않으마
00:16:56	 
		 
00:16:58	Please end this.
		제발 끝내주세요
00:17:01	 
		 
00:17:12	I brought the Gilbert journals.
		길버트의 일기장을
		가져왔어
00:17:15	 
		 
00:17:15	I think I know the spell
		you're talking about.
		네가 말하는 주문
		뭔지 알 것 같아
00:17:17	 
		 
00:17:17	Where's Damon?
		데이먼은 어딨어요?
00:17:18	 
		 
00:17:18	Upstairs. Alaric
		wanted to talk to him.
		위에. 알라릭이
		할 말이 있데
00:17:21	 
		 
00:17:22	He did what?!
		뭘 했다고?
00:17:23	 
		 
00:17:23	He wasn't going
		to let Jenna die.
		제나를 죽게 내버려
		둘 수 없었어
00:17:26	 
		 
00:17:26	We have a witch.
		우린 마녀가 있잖아!
00:17:27	 
		 
00:17:28	She kills Klaus.
		클라우스를 죽이면 되지!
00:17:29	 
		 
00:17:29	No one has to die!
		아무도 죽을 필요 없어!
00:17:31	 
		 
00:17:31	Except for Bonnie.
		보니를 제외하고 말야
00:17:33	 
		 
00:17:33	God, Stefan, damn it!
		스테판, 젠장
00:17:37	 
		 
00:17:40	Hey, are you ok?
		괜찮은 거야?
00:17:43	 
		 
00:17:43	I'm fine.
		괜찮아
00:17:46	 
		 
00:17:47	Well, that's
		my brother for you.
		내 동생이 그렇지
00:17:49	 
		 
00:17:49	Always cleaning up my messes.
		항상 내 뒷처리를 하지
00:17:52	 
		 
00:18:01	Hello, Jenna.
		안녕, 제나
00:18:03	 
		 
00:18:06	Let her go.
		이모를 풀어줘요
00:18:07	 
		 
00:18:07	I understand that I have
		to die, but she doesn't!
		내가 죽는 건 이해하지만
		이모는 안돼요
00:18:10	 
		 
00:18:10	Careful.
		조심해
00:18:12	 
		 
00:18:12	- Elena, don't.
		- No, Jenna!
		- 엘레나, 하지마
		- 안돼, 이모
00:18:13	 
		 
00:18:13	We can't leave Jeremy
		without a family.
		제레미에겐 가족이 필요해
00:18:16	 
		 
00:18:16	I followed your rules, I did
		everything that you asked.
		당신 룰을 따랐잖아요
		모든 걸 했잖아요
00:18:19	 
		 
00:18:19	I didn't run. Please.
		도망가지도 않았어요
		제발요
00:18:22	 
		 
00:18:26	Well, well.
		이런, 이런
00:18:29	 
		 
00:18:30	I don't recall you being
		on the guest list.
		넌 초대목록에
		없는 것 같은데
00:18:33	 
		 
00:18:38	I'm here to talk.
		얘기를 하러 왔다
00:18:40	 
		 
00:18:43	Very well, then.
		좋아, 그럼
00:18:46	 
		 
00:18:47	What can I do for you,
		Mr. Salvatore?
		뭘 도와줄까, 살바토어군?
00:18:50	 
		 
00:18:52	We found something
		in the Gilbert journals.
		길버트의 일기장에서
		뭔가를 찾아냈어
00:18:54	 
		 
00:18:54	Johnathan journaled
		the story of a mother
		조나단의 일기장에는
		에밀리에게 부탁을
00:18:56	 
		 
00:18:56	who called on Emily's services.
		했던 한 엄마의
		이야기가 있어
00:18:57	 
		 
00:18:57	The woman's baby
		was sick; Dying.
		그 여자의 아기는
		아팠고 죽어가고 있었지
00:19:00	 
		 
00:19:00	Emily cast a spell that would bind a
		woman's life force with her child.
		에밀리는 그 여자의 생명력을
		아기에게 주는 주문을 걸었어
00:19:04	 
		 
00:19:04	Skip to the save Elena part.
		그래서 엘레나는요
00:19:05	 
		 
00:19:05	Well, the child died, but
		the mother's life force
		아기는 죽었지만
		그 여자의 생명력이
00:19:08	 
		 
00:19:08	flowed through her,
		restoring her to life.
		아기에게 흘렀고
		다시 살게 됐지
00:19:10	 
		 
00:19:10	We already know Elena's
		going to come back to life.
		우린 이미 누나가 살아
		돌아올거란 건 알잖아요
00:19:13	 
		 
00:19:13	She'll be a vampire.
		하지만 뱀파이어가 되겠죠
00:19:15	 
		 
00:19:15	Not if her soul remains intact.
		영혼이 손상되지 
		않는다면 괜찮아
00:19:16	 
		 
00:19:16	Her soul, really?
		영혼이라고, 정말로?
00:19:18	 
		 
00:19:18	You're going to put your faith
		in some act of God mumbo jumbo?
		무슨 말도 안되는
		미신같은 걸 믿을거야?
00:19:23	 
		 
00:19:25	I refuse to let Elena
		become the thing
		난 내 평생동안
		막으려고 했던
00:19:27	 
		 
00:19:27	I've spent my life
		protecting her against.
		엘레나가 뱀파이어가
		되는 건 거절하겠어
00:19:29	 
		 
00:19:29	And you can call that
		God or mystical energy,
		그리고 그걸 신이든
		신비한 힘이든 
00:19:32	 
		 
00:19:32	whatever you want, but yes...
		뭐라고 불러도 좋아
		하지만
00:19:35	 
		 
00:19:35	I'm putting my faith in it.
		난 그걸 믿겠어
00:19:38	 
		 
00:19:42	What's going on?
		무슨 일이야?
00:19:43	 
		 
00:19:43	I... I don't know.
		나도 모르겠어
00:19:45	 
		 
00:19:46	You can hear them.
		이모는 들을 수 있어
00:19:48	 
		 
00:19:50	You can hear anything.
		뭐든 들을 수 있어
00:19:51	 
		 
00:19:51	Just focus on them.
		집중 해 봐
00:19:54	 
		 
00:19:55	You don't need to kill Jenna.
		제나를 죽일 필요는 없잖아
00:19:57	 
		 
00:19:58	I'll take her place.
		내가 대신하지
00:20:00	 
		 
00:20:01	Oh, I don't know.
		오, 글쎄
00:20:02	 
		 
00:20:03	I rather appreciate
		the symmetry of three women...
		난 여자 세명이
		더 좋은데 말야
00:20:07	 
		 
00:20:07	three goddesses...
		세명의 여신
00:20:09	 
		 
00:20:10	sacrificed at nature's altar.
		자연의 제단에 희생되다
00:20:12	 
		 
00:20:12	What are they saying?
		뭐라고 하는거야?
00:20:13	 
		 
00:20:13	I can't... I can't
		make it out.
		모르겠어
00:20:15	 
		 
00:20:15	You can do this.
		Just relax. Focus.
		할 수 있어
		긴장 풀고, 집중해
00:20:20	 
		 
00:20:20	Don't
		play games with me.
		나랑 장난 치지마
00:20:21	 
		 
00:20:21	You'll get what you want.
		당신이 원하는 걸
		얻게 될거야
00:20:22	 
		 
00:20:22	I can hear him.
		I hear Stefan.
		들을 수 있어
		스테판이 들려
00:20:26	 
		 
00:20:26	What are they saying?
		뭐라고 하는거야?
00:20:27	 
		 
00:20:27	You're quite the hero,
		aren't you?
		너 정말 영웅이구나?
00:20:31	 
		 
00:20:31	I've heard that about you.
		너에 관해 들었어
00:20:33	 
		 
00:20:33	Just make the trade.
		계약이나 성립시켜
00:20:34	 
		 
00:20:35	Me for Jenna.
		제나 대신 나야
00:20:36	 
		 
00:20:36	Oh, my God.
		세상에
00:20:37	 
		 
00:20:37	What is it?
		왜 그래?
00:20:39	 
		 
00:20:43	He wants to take my place.
		나를 대신하려고 해
00:20:45	 
		 
00:20:57	 
		　
00:21:00	 
		 
00:21:04	How's Tyler doing?
		타일러는 좀 어때?
00:21:06	 
		 
00:21:06	Sleeping.
		자고있어
00:21:08	 
		 
00:21:08	He should better by morning.
		아침이 되면 좀 나을거야
00:21:09	 
		 
00:21:09	He just... he needs some rest.
		그냥... 휴식이
		좀 필요한거야
00:21:12	 
		 
00:21:12	Good.
		다행이네
00:21:15	 
		 
00:21:18	So this is your life now, huh?
		이게 지금의 네
		삶이구나?
00:21:20	 
		 
00:21:20	Never a dull moment.
		한 순간도
		지루하지 않지
00:21:21	 
		 
00:21:26	You know, these last few
		days with you have been
		있지, 너랑 보낸
		최근 몇일 동안
00:21:28	 
		 
00:21:28	so great, and fun.
		정말 좋고 재밌었어
00:21:32	 
		 
00:21:32	And so Caroline.
		그리고 정말
		너 다웠어
00:21:36	 
		 
00:21:36	I... I thought that
		I might be able
		난 내가
		이런 일들을
00:21:39	 
		 
00:21:39	to get past this
		whole vampire thing.
		모두 이겨낼 수
		있을 거라고 생각했어
00:21:40	 
		 
00:21:41	But you can.
		할 수 있어
00:21:44	 
		 
00:21:44	Matt...
		맷
00:21:45	 
		 
00:21:45	I don't know
		if I can, Caroline.
		나도 확신이
		안 서, 캐롤라인
00:21:47	 
		 
00:21:47	Matt!
		맷
00:21:49	 
		 
00:21:53	I get it.
		This is your life now.
		이해해
		이제 이게 네 삶이지
00:21:56	 
		 
00:21:56	You know what my life is, car?
		내 삶은 어떤 줄 알아?
00:21:58	 
		 
00:21:59	My life is an absentee mom.
		엄마는 없고
00:22:02	 
		 
00:22:02	And a bunch of bills to pay,
		빚은 산더미 같고
00:22:04	 
		 
00:22:04	and school, and a job,
		학교에, 일에
00:22:07	 
		 
00:22:07	and it sucks sometimes.
		가끔은 정말 짜증나
00:22:09	 
		 
00:22:10	But it's my life.
		하지만 이게 
		내 삶이야
00:22:11	 
		 
00:22:11	And...
		그리고...
00:22:14	 
		 
00:22:16	I think that I just want to
		live it without all of this.
		이런 것들 없이
		살아갔으면 좋겠어
00:22:19	 
		 
00:22:23	 
		　
00:22:25	 
		 
00:22:28	 
		　
00:22:29	 
		 
00:22:29	Come on, Bonnie, we
		got a hybrid to kill.
		어서, 보니
		그놈을 죽여야 하잖아
00:22:32	 
		 
00:22:35	It's done.
		끝났어
00:22:36	 
		 
00:22:36	That's it?
		그게 다야?
00:22:37	 
		 
00:22:37	Let's go.
		어서 가자
00:22:39	 
		 
00:22:40	I'll be back soon.
		곧 돌아올게
00:22:41	 
		 
00:22:41	Wait, what do you mean?
		잠깐, 무슨 뜻이야?
00:22:43	 
		 
00:22:44	No, I'm coming.
		I need to be there.
		아니, 나도 갈거야
		나도 가야해
00:22:45	 
		 
00:22:45	I need to make sure
		you guys are ok.
		모두가 괜찮은 지
		봐야 한다고
00:22:47	 
		 
00:22:47	And who's going
		to make sure you're ok?
		그럼 너는
		누가 봐주니?
00:22:49	 
		 
00:22:49	I've got my own ring.
		반지가 있잖아
00:22:50	 
		 
00:22:50	Look, I'm not taking no
		for an answer.
		'아니'란 대답은
		하지 않을 거야
00:22:53	 
		 
00:23:02	Easy... easy.
		조심, 조심
00:23:04	 
		 
00:23:06	Just go.
		I'll stay with him.
		어서 가
		내가 같이 있을게
00:23:08	 
		 
00:23:14	- It's time.
		- All right.
		- 지금이야
		- 좋아
00:23:17	 
		 
00:23:17	I got the weapons in the car.
		차에 무기가 있어요
00:23:18	 
		 
00:23:18	Bonnie's the only
		weapon we need.
		보니가 유일한 무기야
00:23:20	 
		 
00:23:20	Ahh!
		　
00:23:22	 
		 
00:23:22	Bonnie!
		What is this?
		보니!
		이게 뭐야?
00:23:24	 
		 
00:23:25	I can't put
		anyone else at risk.
		누구도 위험에
		빠트릴 순 없어요
00:23:26	 
		 
00:23:26	I can't stay here
		with Jenna out there!
		제나가 거기 있는데
		어떻게 여기 있어?!
00:23:28	 
		 
00:23:28	I'm sorry.
		미안해요
00:23:29	 
		 
00:23:29	You can't do this!
		Damon?
		이럴 순 없어!
		데이먼?
00:23:31	 
		 
00:23:31	Sorry, buddy.
		She's right.
		미안, 친구
		얘 말이 맞아
00:23:33	 
		 
00:23:33	No! You can't do this.
		아니!
		이럴 순 없어
00:23:35	 
		 
00:23:35	Bonnie!
		보니!
00:23:37	 
		 
00:23:37	Bonnie!
		보니!
00:23:39	 
		 
00:23:40	Elena...
		I have to do something.
		- 엘레나...
		- 무언갈 해야만 해
00:23:43	 
		 
00:23:43	This can't happen.
		None of it.
		이럴 순 없어
		아무것도
00:23:46	 
		 
00:23:46	Quite
		the predicament.
		난처해 보이는 군
00:23:47	 
		 
00:23:48	You know, it's funny,
		있지, 참 재밌어
00:23:50	 
		 
00:23:50	all this talk about
		preserving family,
		이 가족을 지키는
		이야기 말야
00:23:51	 
		 
00:23:51	and here's Stefan,
		그리고 여기
		스테판이 있지
00:23:54	 
		 
00:23:54	granting your wish.
		네 소원을 들어주러
00:23:55	 
		 
00:23:55	Stefan...
		스테판
00:23:57	 
		 
00:23:58	It's ok.
		괜찮아
00:23:59	 
		 
00:23:59	Well.
		그럼
00:24:00	 
		 
00:24:01	Who's it going to be, Elena?
		누구를 택할 건가, 엘레나?
00:24:03	 
		 
00:24:04	No.
		안돼요
00:24:05	 
		 
00:24:07	Oh, don't worry.
		걱정하지 마
00:24:09
